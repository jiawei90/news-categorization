The man who sold the product over WeChat has since been charged for the possession of illegally imported duck's blood and meat products, and the abetment of illegal import of processed food.  The case is ongoing. It is unclear how the man managed to bring the products into Singapore.  Animal blood food products are prohibited as blood can easily support the growth of bacteria and harbour diseases, AVA said. \"Unhygienic harvesting of blood can also result in the introduction of food borne pathogens into blood food products. Meat, eggs and their products can only be imported from accredited sources in approved countries that comply with our food safety standards and requirements,\" it added.  Those found guilty of illegally importing food products may be fined up to S$50,000 and jailed for up to two years for their first conviction.

Eventually, his patrol team grew to include LTA officers, police officers, and volunteer residents, and became known as the LTA Braddell Heights Active Mobility Patrol Team. Mr Yee is one of 18 winners of this year's Municipal Services Awards, organised by the Municipal Services Office (MSO).  The awards recognise the collaborative efforts of local volunteers, multiple government agencies, and town councils in solving municipal problems. Aside from unsafe roads, these problems also include stray dogs, wild monkey break-ins, and high-rise littering. This year, MSO received 97 nominations compared with 68 last year.  The community category included a young team of students from Ai Tong Primary School.  These young citizens had worked with the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore, and the Thomson Sin Ming Court RC to educate residents in neighbouring areas on pigeon feeding. Such feeding was causing the pigeon population to grow, potentially increasing the spread of diseases. His experience serving the community has inspire him to \"help more people that are maybe facing problems in the community” said one young team member, Aaron Feng. He has gone on to volunteer his services in several programmes, including preparing food for those in elderly homes.  Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, who oversees MSO, lauded the integrated efforts of these different groups and individuals.  She called for greater cooperation between agencies and residents, saying that “local communities know best what the challenges are on the ground, and have valuable networks and relationships that can be tapped to tackle the municipal issues”. “Many of the residents hold resources that are so important to the resolution of the problem,” said Ms Fu.  She also highlighted that the Municipal Services Awards “is a way to signal the importance that the community work to MSO will continue to be a major part of our focus.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/community-efforts-lauded-at-this-year-s-municipal-services-10709556"}, {"datetime": "12 Sep 2018 08:02PM", "tags": ["Ministry of Manpower"], "author": "", "title": "New mobile app for foreign workers to give feedback on dormitories", "content": " SINGAPORE: Foreign workers will now be able to provide feedback on any issue or problem they may face in their dormitories via a mobile phone app launched on Wednesday (Sep 12).  Called DormWatch, the app allows foreign workers to upload photos or videos along with a short description of the issues they face. Dormitory operators will also be able to communicate directly with the worker through the app and provide details on how the issues have been resolved.    “The platform promotes co-responsibility at the dormitories, where operators are encouraged to engage their residents frequently, and to work with them to improve living conditions and environment,” said Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad, who launched the app at an awards event recognising operators for exemplary foreign worker housing management. Any feedback provided will be shared with Ministry of Manpower, who will only step in and work with both parties if there is an impasse, he added. The app is still in its beta phase, and currently available only in English and Chinese. Bengali and Tamil will be added in the future, MOM said in a separate press release. “We look forward to working with both the operators and the foreign workers to develop the app further so that it can best meet the needs of the users,” said Mr Zaqy at the second annual Dormitory Awards event. At the event, Mr Zaqy handed out awards to 17 dormitory operators he praised for “actively engaging their residents to co-create a conducive living environment”. Among them was DDJV Dormitory, operated by TS Group. Following feedback from residents that their rooms were too warm, the management installed industrial fans, followed by air-conditioners, to ensure that they would be able to rest well, Mr Zaqy noted. Mr Zaqy also lauded Greyform, which operates a factory-converted dormitory, for providing “specially designed” accommodation with facilities for team sports and a rooftop community garden. Hai Leck Holdings was also singled out for its facilities, which includes a library. Besides English classes, the dormitory also provides eggs and tea for residents every morning.   MOM reported earlier this month that living conditions have improved for foreign workers housing, as evidenced by a drop in the number of offenders for housing-related contraventions to 1,176 violations in 2017 from 1,451 cases in 2015.  Chairman of the Migrant Workers’ Centre, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, said in MOM’s press release on Wednesday that it is “heartening to see good employers and operators going the extra mile to look after the interests of their workers”. “Our migrant workers have come a long way to help build our country and economy, so it is only right that we look after their physical and emotional well-being while they are here, both at the workplace and in the places where they live and socialise,” he said. Mr Steven Lee, president of the Dormitory Association of Singapore, added: “Every dormitory has a responsibility to provide a safe and conducive environment for all foreign workers … Not only should we look at the physical needs of our residents, but also continue attending to their psychosocial needs.

The 13 distributors had been involved in unethical price fixing and market sharing practices for seven years.  Here are the 5 things to know about the case: 1. WHERE THE CHICKENS COME FROM The 13 companies in question import live chickens from farms in Malaysia, subsequently slaughtering them in Singapore. Then, the distributors sell the fresh chicken to supermarkets, restaurants, hotels, wet market stalls and hawker stalls. In 2016 alone, approximately 49 million chickens were slaughtered in Singapore. 2. CHICKEN IS THE MOST CONSUMED MEAT IN SINGAPORE The average Singaporean consumes as much as 35kg of chicken a year. According to data from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore, that's as much as the average intake of fish and pork combined. Mutton ranks a distant fourth at 3kg consumed annually, with beef rounding out the top five at just 1kg. 3. IT IS A HALF-BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY The 13 fresh chicken distributors that were punished were dubbed a cartel; the collective is responsible for supplying over 90 per cent of Singapore's fresh chickens. The combined annual turnover of the 13 companies amounted to S$500 million. 4. HOW THE COMPANIES COLLABORATED For at least seven years, the companies had: So with each member having its own slice of the (chicken pot) pie, the anti-competitive measures culminated in ... 5. COORDINATED PRICE HIKES The coordinated price increases ranged from 10 cents to 30 cents per kg on at least seven occasions – July 2008, May 2009, August 2010, January 2011, March 2011, January 2013 and January 2014.

The 39-year-old was pleased to have found an efficient mode of transport that would allow him to avoid having to squeeze in crowded buses and trains to travel to and from his work. But his plans to use the two-wheeler for that length of time were dashed on Monday (Sep 10), when the government announced that all motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs) must conform with UL2272 fire safety standards by 2021.  \"So I've spent all this money on this scooter, only to be told I have to get rid of it in two years or risk breaking the law,\" said Mr Loh, who uses the device to travel to and from his workplace in Clarke Quay.  Like the majority of e-scooters in the Singapore market, Mr Loh's Inokim is not compliant with UL2272 - a technical standard developed by an independent US certification company - which the Singapore government said minimises the risk of motorised PMDs catching fire.  There have been 80 fire incidents involving motorised PMDs since 2016. Data released by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) earlier this year also showed that e-scooters were involved in 40 fires last year, an increase of nearly 350 per cent from nine such cases in 2016. But Mr Lor maintains that customers like him should not be punished for purchasing e-scooters that are not compliant with UL2272, having not been informed of this new law beforehand.  \"When I bought it last week, I decided to invest a bit more money because I thought it was something that I can use for the next five to seven years. But now they're telling me I have to get rid of it soon,\" said Mr Lor. \"I can't even sell it off in Singapore, since it won’t be legal,\" he said, adding that he will make a report with the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE).   Mr Chew Boon Hur, general manager for major PMD retailer Mobot, told Channel NewsAsia that \"almost all\" the models in Singapore are currently not compliant with UL2272. He stressed that the time frame given by the government for customers to comply with the new standards is too short, especially for those who purchased their devices this year.  \"We want to feedback to LTA to delay the implementation of the law by one more year, to 2022. This is for customers who just bought their scooters recently,\" said Mr Chew. \"The average lifespan of an e-scooter is three to four years, so that's enough time for the customer to use it, discard it and buy a new one by end-2021,\" he added. However, e-scooter user Mr Timothy Gan argued that the new requirement will deem almost all the models currently in the market in Singapore illegal, and is akin to \"imposing a ban on PMDs without actually banning them outright”. “Insisting that all PMDs comply with UL2272 is effectively banning them from Singapore. Almost everyone will have to throw away their e-scooters and spend even more money to buy new ones,” said the undergraduate. Mr Victor Lee, general manager for Falcon PEV, one of the leading distributors for PMDs in Singapore, argued that having a blanket rule and insisting that all e-scooters conform to UL2272 is flawed. \"We question whether this certification really makes sense at all. It’s a US certification, meant for US brands and models. If they wanted to (impose an international safety standard), they should have introduced one approved by the International Electrotechnical Commission. UL2272 was introduced in 2016 because of hoverboards; PMDs are not hoverboards,\" said Mr Lee.  The UL2272 standard was first published for hoverboards in the US in November 2016, but its scope has since been extended to cover all types of motorised PMDs.  PRICES COULD INCREASE BY 20 PER CENT  Additionally, Mr Lee warned that getting Falcon PEV e-scooter models to be UL2272-compliant could result in higher prices for customers.  \"The cost will be levied onto customers. It's substantial - bound to be between 10 and 20 per cent.\" he said. \"It's too premature to specify how much exactly, but the prices of all PMDs will definitely go up.\" Mr Chew said that the cost of getting its e-scooters UL2272-certified will be between S$50,000 and S$100,000 per model, and will translate to higher prices for buyers.   “Consumers will expect costs to increase, possibly by up to S$100 … But we don’t know exactly how much yet,” he said. Mr Chew added that Mobot, which previously sold 3,000 e-scooters annually, has seen a 40 per cent decline in sales since the beginning of the year due to the various regulations the government has imposed on users of PMDs, including mandatory registration, speed limits and illegal modifications. But he maintained that business will likely pick up over the next few years and that the PMD scene in Singapore is “moving in the right direction”. “By setting rules and regulations, you are making this industry to be the norm. In other words, people already know this is going to be the way forward for Singapore to use e-scooter as the mode of transport,” he added. However, Falcon PEV's Mr Lee does not share the same view. He stressed that the regulations have already triggered a steady decline in sales, and there will be a further decline in the coming years as there is a “cloud of uncertainty” over whether PMDs are considered a part of Singapore’s future transport scene. “No one is willing to guarantee anything. Last week, the government announced that all PMDs cannot travel more than 10km per hour on footpaths. This week they announced fire safety standards. What’s coming next week?” He added that the UL2272 fire safety standard could result in PMD firms “packing up” from the Singapore market, as many may not be able to find the right supplier. “There are too many regulations and restrictions and boundaries. To turn something so viable for a car-lite society to something that is so complicated is a huge waste,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pmd-fire-safety-rule-effectively-a-ban-users-retailers-10707880"}, {"datetime": "12 Sep 2018 04:57PM", "tags": ["schools", "Ministry of Education"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore students bag top medals at international science, math, geography competitions", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore students have excelled in a number of international competitions in the past couple of months, winning top accolades in subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics and geography.  The competitions, held from July to September, took place in various cities around the world, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Wednesday (Jul 12).

He grew to believe that the use of violence in the name of religion was justified and by late 2016, he was convinced that he should fight and die as a martyr for IS in its self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq, according to MHA.  The ministry said Ahmed maintained regular contact with foreign pro-IS individuals on social media to keep up with the developments in IS. He also tried to influence some of his foreign online contacts to follow the violent teachings of the radical ideologues whom he had been following, because he wanted them to support ​​​​​​​IS. Meanwhile, an Order of Detention against 39-year-old Munavar Baig Amina Begam was suspended in July this year, MHA added. Amina was detained in November 2017 for supporting IS and harbouring the intention to make her way to Syria to join the terrorist group. She was released from detention after it was assessed that she no longer posed an imminent security threat that required her to be placed in preventive detention, MHA said.  At the time of her detention last year, Amina was a housewife who harboured the intention to join IS in the conflict zone.  A naturalised Singaporean originally from India, she was radicalised by a foreign contact online, who shared pro-IS materials with her.  Amina was prepared to undergo military training and fight for the terrorist group in the Middle East if called upon, MHA said in an earlier news release, adding that she also shared materials promoting terrorism on social media.  SEEK KNOWLEDGE FROM CREDIBLE SOURCES: MUIS In a statement on Wednesday evening, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) reminded the Muslim community to seek knowledge from credible sources, in particular from asatizah or religious teachers registered under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme.  \"This latest case of self-radicalisation reinforces the danger of seeking religious knowledge from the Internet,\" said MUIS. \"It is possible for individuals to be swayed by the narratives of foreign radical ideologues, who misinterpret the religion to incite violence and promote terrorism.\" MUIS advised anyone interested in a consultation with an asatizah may contact Al-Falah Mosque at 6235-3172 to arrange an appointment.

Mr Johnson Ong Ming, a 43-year-old disc jockey and producer, filed the case on Monday (Sep 10). According to court papers, the case argues that Section 377A of the Penal Code is inconsistent with three articles in the Constitution concerning liberty of a person and equal protection. Under 377A, any male person who commits or tries to get another male person to commit \"any act of gross indecency with another male person\", whether in public or private, can be jailed for up to two years. The first of three articles in the Constitution that Mr Ong refers to says that \"no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law\".  The other two articles state that \"all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law\", and \"there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law\".  Mr Ong, who also owns a digital marketing agency, told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday that he chose to mount the court challenge as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) groups are \"not allowed to organise\" and \"don't see ourselves represented positively on mainstream media, if at all\". \"Without access to help and resources, navigating through life is a lonely and often stressful process for every LGBT Singaporean,\" he said.  \"Most importantly, I am not a criminal and I do not want to go through life being branded as one by my own country. It takes a psychological toll on you going through life thinking you are less than everyone else.\" Mr Ong will be represented by lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, who will contend that Section 377A is \"accordingly void\" as it is inconsistent with the Constitution. In response to queries by Channel NewsAsia, Mr Thuraisingam’s law firm said it will argue that Section 377A “violates human dignity”. As sexual orientation is “unchangeable or suppressible at unacceptable personal cost”, criminalising its manifestation is “absurd” and “arbitrary”, Mr Thuraisingam will contend. He will provide expert evidence to prove his points, and note that “an unusually large number of legal developments in various jurisdictions have occurred in a short span of time” since 2014, when the last legal challenge against 377A was mounted in Singapore. Mr Ong's court challenge comes a few days after India ruled to decriminalise consensual gay sex in the country, a move that sparked discussion in the local community on repealing Section 377A. Veteran Singapore diplomat Tommy Koh called for Singapore's gay community to challenge 377A last week. The ambassador-at-large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the comments in response to a Facebook post on India's landmark ruling.  Legal challenges against the law, in 2014, had failed, but Professor Koh said: \"Try again.\" Chief of Government Communications Janadas Devan also wrote on his Facebook page that he personally supports Prof Koh's position. Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam had said it is up to Singapore's society to decide which direction it wants to take on gay sex legislation. Mr Ong, who has been in a relationship for more than a year, said he was energised by India's ruling and Prof Koh's statement. He added that a successful court challenge would be \"a monumental moment for not just the LGBTQ community but for all Singaporeans because gay rights, like women’s rights, like any subjugated minority rights, are human rights\".

After a short chase, Mr Wong detained him at Bishan Bus Interchange, the news release added. In the second case, Mr Ng Jian Zuan was travelling on an escalator at Braddell MRT Station at about 10.30pm on Sep 8 when he noticed an 18-year-old man in front of him placing his mobile phone underneath a woman's skirt.

Mr Ng was unable to attend the ceremony. SUPT Wong said: “Commuters must be vigilant to their surroundings when travelling on public transport.

Developing new initiatives to prepare for the future economy is the way forward, Mr Lee said.  The Prime Minister said technology is transforming old tasks and shaping the way the world functions. In the meantime, businesses are changing the way they operate while workers are using technology to be more productive. Technological breakthroughs will no doubt become faster and even more advanced, he added.  But the Prime Minister said he was confident ASEAN member nations can take advantage of the opportunities presented by this new environment.  STRONG FUNDAMENTALS, COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC INTEGRATION By collaborating as a 10-member grouping, Mr Lee said he believed ASEAN will be able to strengthen its position and deal with future challenges, especially when the open rules-based multilateral trading system comes under increasing pressure and threat. For one, Mr Lee said, ASEAN possesses strong fundamentals as it will become the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 after the US, China and the EU.  Mr Lee said 60 per cent of ASEAN's combined 630 million population is under 35 years old, and the young and educated workforce is comfortable with new technology.  The digital economy is projected to grow to US$200 billion by 2025, he added. He also said ASEAN is committed to further economic integration, an \"important condition\" for the fourth industrial revolution. \"It is about building networks, creating new synergies and staying connected. ASEAN member states have been working together towards the ASEAN Economic Blueprint 2025, so that ASEAN businesses can operate more seamlessly across the region,\" he said.  Mr Lee said it is important to involve businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, because they are the \"backbone of our economies and the source of entrepreneurship\". Technology can benefit the ASEAN countries' businesses and people, Mr Lee said.  For example, ASEAN is working on streamlining e-commerce regulations to enable businesses within the grouping to trade more easily with one another, and a single online platform for cross-border customs cargo clearance will cut transaction costs, he said.  Singapore will also be hosting the Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific trade event next month.  The major industrial fair will expose ASEAN firms to the latest industrial technologies, and manufacturers, technology providers and innovators can share their ideas and equipment.  This will enable ASEAN members to upgrade their manufacturing sectors, which is a key pillar of many regional economies, Mr Lee said.  The Prime Minister said the fourth industrial revolution is a \"dynamic and continuing process\"  \"We cannot predict how exactly it will unfold, but I am optimistic about ASEAN’s future because ASEAN has its own competitive strengths. By pooling our ideas and resources and integrating our economies, we will be in a strong position to ride on this fourth wave to bring tangible benefits to our economies and our peoples.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/asean-in-good-position-to-take-advantage-of-tech-revolution-pm-10708006"}, {"datetime": "12 Sep 2018 01:00PM", "tags": ["Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore", "chicken cartel"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "13 fresh chicken distributors fined record S$26.9m for price fixing, market sharing", "content": " SINGAPORE: Thirteen fresh chicken distributors that engaged in price fixing and market sharing have been fined a total of S$26.9 million – the highest financial penalty meted out by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) for a single case. For nearly seven years, the suppliers had discussed and coordinated the amount and timing of price increases ranging from S$0.10 to S$0.30 per kg on at least seven occasions. They also agreed not to compete for each other’s customers, said the CCCS on Wednesday (Sep 12). Supplying more than 90 per cent of fresh chicken products in Singapore, the 13 companies have a total turnover of about S$500 million a year. CCCS said the “seriousness and long duration” of the cartel conduct, alongside other factors such as the distributors’ high market share and the large size of the industry, contributed to the heavy fines. The 13 distributors are Gold Chic Poultry Supply and its related firm Hua Kun Food Industry; Hy-fresh Industries; Kee Song Food Corporation; Ng Ai Food Industries; Sinmah Poultry Processing; Toh Thye San Farm; as well as the affiliated companies of Lee Say Group and Tong Huat Group. Among them, four submitted leniency applications after investigations begun, and were eventually given reductions in their financial penalties for coming forward with information and evidence about the cartel activities. These include Tong Huat Group, Sinmah, Kee Song and Hy-fresh. CCCS declined to reveal the reduction that was given to each distributor under its leniency programme. \n\n\n\n\n Investigations into the fresh chicken distribution industry, which refers to chickens slaughtered here as opposed to frozen ones imported into Singapore, began in March 2014 after the CCCS received information from a secret complainant. The complainant was a former employee at one of the 13 suppliers, said CCCS’ deputy director of business and economics Kong Weng Loong during a media briefing. The companies were found to have held meetings – some at The Poultry Merchants’ Association that the suppliers are members of – from at least Sep 19, 2007 to Aug 13, 2014. They had “expressly coordinated” the amount and timing of price increases of certain fresh chicken products, such as whole fresh chickens, sold in Singapore, said CCCS. Prices were increased by S$0.10 to S$0.30 per kg on at least seven instances – July 2008, May 2009, August 2010, January 2011, March 2011, January 2013 and January 2014. Meanwhile, the 13 suppliers also agreed not to compete for each other’s customers – a move that CCCS described as restricting choices made available to customers. Together with the coordinated price increases, customers had “limited option” to switch to more competitive distributors, added CCCS. \"In view of the high combined market shares of the parties and as chicken is the most commonly consumed meat in Singapore, the parties’ anti-competitive conduct impacted a large number of customers including supermarkets, restaurants, hotels, wet market stalls and hawker stalls, and ultimately, end-consumers of these fresh chicken products,\" said the commission. The CCCS issued a Proposed Infringement Decision to all 13 suppliers on Mar 8, 2016, but decided to conduct further investigations in September when new information emerged. Last December, CCCS issued a supplementary decision against the parties, and received further written and oral representations. CCCS said it carefully considered all the representations in reaching its findings.  Apart from the financial penalty, the distributors have also been asked to provide a written undertaking that they will refrain from using The Poultry Merchants’ Association or any other industry association as a platform for anti-competitive activities. All 13 suppliers are members of The Poultry Merchants’ Association and during the period of infringement, Sinmah’s executive chairman Chiew Kin Huat was the association’s secretary, according to CCCS.  When asked if CCCS will work with the association to prevent a repeat of the cartel activities, assistant chief executive of legal, enforcement and consumer protection Lee Cheow Han said the commission has “no intention or plans to engage (The Poultry Merchants’ Association) directly” at the moment, but will deploy “other monitoring mechanisms”. Its chief executive Toh Han Li said: \"Price fixing and market sharing are considered some of the most harmful types of anti-competitive conduct. Such conduct is particularly harmful when the products affected are widely consumed in Singapore, such as in this case.\" He added: \"CCCS will continue to take strong enforcement action to ensure that cartels do not negatively impact Singapore markets and harm businesses and consumers.\"  The 13 distributors have two months to file an appeal to the Competition Appeal Board.  When contacted, Toh Thye San Farm declined to comment, citing ongoing discussions with its lawyers. Channel NewsAsia has reached out to the other companies.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fresh-chicken-distributors-fined-price-fixing-competition-10708064"}, {"datetime": "12 Sep 2018 12:31PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Construction worker gets jail for attacking colleague for 'not doing enough work'", "content": " SINGAPORE: Unhappy that his colleague was \"not doing enough work\" at the construction site, a worker attacked him over four occasions while on shift. On Wednesday (Sep 12), Li Dong was sentenced to 13 weeks' jail for one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon, and a second charge of voluntarily causing hurt. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Both men are Chinese nationals aged 46 who worked with Meztec Construction, the court heard. Li's work permit was cancelled after the assault. The victim, Mr Qu Hanjun, is a construction worker for the company and was appointed as a foreman, although he did not have supervisory powers over Li. On May 18 this year, Li confronted Mr Qu at a construction site in Tampines \"for not doing enough work\", Deputy Public Prosecutor Jarret Huang said. \"This may have been because the victim, being a foreman, was not tasked with as much physical work,\" he added. They began quarrelling, and Li kicked his colleague, before punching the back of his neck. Li was restrained by other workers, and Mr Qu was moved to a different dormitory. ATTACKED VICTIM AGAIN AT WORK SITE BRIEFING More than a month later, on Jul 2, Li attended a work site briefing in Yuan Ching Road with Mr Qu. The latter was sitting on a low wall, listening to the briefing, when Li used half a brick and hit him on the back of his neck. Li was again restrained and Mr Qu felt dizzy from the attack and was taken back to his dorm. The pain persisted even though he rested and took Chinese medication, and he went to a polyclinic three days later where he was diagnosed with contusions and given two days' medical leave and pain medication. This act was witnessed by a Bangladeshi construction worker, who said he was sure that he saw Li using a brick in his hand to hit Mr Qu. Li also hit Mr Qu on his back with the flat part of a scraper and punched his face at the Yuan Ching Road construction site in May. Mr Qu lodged a report together with his manager in July after the incident with the brick. The prosecution had asked for 16 weeks' jail, saying that Li had persisted in attacking the same victim, and that he had denied his actions until he was told there was video footage. He said there should be \"a strong deterrent message to other foreign workers that these wanton acts of violence cannot and will not be condoned by the State\". Li's defence lawyer asked for six weeks' jail, saying that her client claimed he had been bullied by Mr Qu, who scolded him \"every single day\". In a letter to the judge, Li said he acted on impulse and was remorseful. \"I have two aged parents, two school-going children, a wife who is unemployed, and I'm the sole breadwinner of the family. Please give me a chance,\" he wrote in Chinese. His lawyer added that Li was \"a very hard-working construction worker who has come to Singapore over the last eight years\". In giving his sentence, District Judge Marvin Bay said it was fortunate that the injuries caused were not more serious, as the brick attack could have caused \"even death\". He told Li: \"Even if you have a turbulent history of altercation with the victim, you should be mindful that you are here to make a living. You must curtail your propensity for violence if you hope to provide for your family by working overseas.\" He added that there is a need \"to keep our construction sites and other work premises safe\". For voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon, Li could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned, or any combination of these punishments.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/construction-worker-gets-jail-for-attacking-colleague-for-not-10707752"}, {"datetime": "12 Sep 2018 12:11PM", "tags": ["crime", "scams", "Singapore Police Force"], "author": "", "title": "Police issue advisory on lucky draw scams", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Wednesday (Sep 12) warned the public to be wary of scams involving lucky draw winnings. The police revealed in a news release that they had received at least 84 reports of lucky draw scams between October 2017 and July 2018.  The total amount cheated from the scams was about S$122,000, where the highest amount cheated was about S$34,400. According to the police, the scammers' modus operandi involved making contact with a potential victim through the instant messaging application IMO.  The scammer, hiding behind the username World Winner, would then inform the victim that they had won some money in a lucky draw.  The victim would then be directed to transfer money or purchase iTunes gift cards before they could receive their winnings. In one of the cases, a scammer impersonated a police officer. Claiming to be an officer from the SPF, he told his victim that the latter's bank account was involved in an illegal transaction. And for investigation purposes, the victim had to provide his debit or credit card details, including the CVV number.  After complying with the \"investigation\", the victim received a text message, purportedly sent by the police, informing him that he would be rewarded with a sum of money. The victim then discovered that unauthorised transactions had been made from his bank account. The police urged members of the public to be wary of such messages, especially if they have not recently participated in lucky draws.  Neither the police nor other governmental agencies would request for personal details or transfer of money over the phone, the SPF added in its news release.  \"Do not give out your personal information, credit/debit card details and bank account details to unknown individuals.\" They added that the public should ignore any instructions to make payments by remitting money of purchasing gift cards. Winning a lucky draw should not require any payments to be made to claim the prize.  The police added that anyone who wants to provide any information related to such crimes can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness.

The 56-year-old is a self-professed loving fan of the island-city, having visited “so many times, I don’t even count”. “I think Singapore is one of the great cities of the world,” White told CNA Lifestyle. And it’s not just the cornucopia of local food that he loves, White revealed, it’s also the people and the trees. “I love how green Singapore is,” he said. “I love gardens!” Which might explain why the man, dubbed as the “first celebrity chef” and a game-changer for British cuisine, decided that his first restaurant in Asia would open right here in Singapore. The English House is White’s first Asian outpost and officially opens on Wednesday (Sep 12). It is housed in two adjoining 19th-century conservation colonial shophouses along Mohamed Sultan Road, one of which used to be popular '90s nightspot Madam Wong’s, which shut its doors more than a decade ago.  Painstakingly restored over nearly three years, The English House is billed as “Singapore’s first restaurant with rooms”.  The hotel part, which boasts 18 rooms on the second floor, is set to open in the first quarter of 2019. The restaurant promises Modern British cuisine, focusing on authentic and generous renditions of English classics like Stuffed Cabbage in a fresh tomato sauce and shareable platters of Rib of Black Angus Beef with braised spiced tendons and jus viande. White is known for many things: Being the youngest chef at the time to be awarded three Michelin stars, for his eponymous restaurant in London when he was just 33; returning those very stars in 1999 when he retired from cooking; for his intimidating presence and frank comments on both the original Hell’s Kitchen and MasterChef competition series; and for being the former boss and mentor of Gordon Ramsay and Mario Batali.But when it comes to opening The English House in Singapore, he also sees himself as a “caretaker”. “I have a responsibility to the history of these shophouses,” he said. \"So if I’m put in charge of developing these shophouses, then I have to be sensitive and I have to respect the past. I’m a great believer in ‘respect the house’.” He added: \"I have let the Singaporean culture and history inform the look and feel of The English House, but also added an understated piece of England into the space.” For White, who has filled The English house with kopitiam-style chairs, the world's largest collection of Terry O’Neill photographs and English carnival-themed sculptures, the only thing that never dates an establishment is \"romance\".  “If you look at what we’ve created here, it’s ‘yin and yang’. It’s a bit of the old world and a bit of the modern world,\" he said. \"It’s about the feel. The eye must always be amused.\" Indeed, that’s another reason why there is no big sign that shouts “The English House” when you drive up Mohamed Sultan Road. “If you want to come, you’ll find us. And that’s not arrogance, that’s (being) understated,” he said. For White, it’s all about “respect”. “Respect that we’re in Singapore, respect the Singaporean culture, just be understated,” he said. “Don’t make too much noise. Just do your job.” White also revealed to CNA Lifestyle that Michelin Guide wrote to him asking if he would like to be included in their guide now that he’s opened The English House in Singapore. His response?  “No.” “Because I don’t need Michelin and they don’t need me,” he said with a smile. “They sell tyres and I sell food.” According to White, it’s all very simple to what’s most important. “I think what you got to do is to create an environment which people wish to sit in. You have to create a menu which is interesting to people. You have to create food which is delicious and affordable. I think that’s what’s important. And you have to hope that people choose to spend their hard earned income at your business. There’s no guarantees. “Because remember, restaurateurs are only shopkeepers, that’s all we are.

She was 27, four months pregnant and diagnosed with a life-threatening auto-immune disease back in 2016. Then newly remarried and with five young children from her previous marriage, she could not turn to family for help in caring for them during her frequent and long hospital stays. Her husband, a first-time father, felt overwhelmed. It was Madam Zarina Omar, 48, who came to her rescue. The childminder had been taking care of Ms Rashidah’s youngest son, Rayhan, since 2015, and took in his siblings as well. She put them up at her home for as long as was needed, sometimes overnight. “She told me not to worry, that she will take care of my kids. She told me to focus on myself and recovering,” Ms Rashidah told Channel NewsAsia at Madam Zarina’s flat in Bukit Batok. She gave birth to a girl and recovered a few months later. Even when she was healthy, Ms Rashidah said that it was hard to focus on work without a childminder. Her limited number of childcare leave days was quickly used up whenever the childcare centre closed or when a child was too ill to go to school.  “Of course, we don’t want to be termed a ‘problem employee’ because we keep taking leave for our children,” said Ms Rashidah, who was working in a shipping firm. Being employed is important as it would qualify her for infant and childcare subsidies which require the applicant to work a minimum of 56 hours per month, she added. CHILDMINDING “NOT ABOUT THE MONEY”: MADAM ZARINA Ms Rashidah would pay Madam Zarinah S$200 to S$300 a month. She had tried engaging a babysitter for her older child but found that she could not afford the S$500 monthly fee on her S$1,400 salary. “The arrangement is not about money. It’s about help. Somebody wants my help, so I tell them ‘whatever you can give me, you just give me’,” Madam Zarina said. “I like children, and when I help people, I feel happy,” she added. The relationship between the two women has grown over the three years, and now, Madam Zarina takes care of Ms Rashidah’s younger children when their childcare centre is closed, or when the children are not well. Seeing them interact, it is not difficult to mistake the two women as mother and daughter. Ms Rashidah calls the older woman “Ibu” (mother) after all. “She is like a mother to me,” she said. COMMUNITY CHILDMINDERS OFFERS PEACE OF MIND A programme piloted in Bukit Batok aims to help more mothers in Ms Rashidah’s position. Called the Community Childminding programme, the effort by charity group Daughters of Tomorrow (DoT) was launched in February this year. Executive director of DoT, Carrie Tan, said the idea was sparked following three years of experience from placing women from low-income families into gainful employment. She found that many of these women were not able to hold down their jobs due to childcare needs and contingencies. “We needed a way for the women to get support near their homes to pick up or help care for their kids so they don’t have to keep taking urgent leave from work. In many cases, women were also prevented from taking on jobs that required shift work, as they had no options for childcare in the evenings or on weekends,” she said. Madam Zarina is now part of the programme, and has taken care of 10 children. She makes herself available even in the evenings, while parents work overtime. There are now 15 childminders under the initiative, said Ms Tan. Since the programme started, the service has been used by 13 women from low-income families, clocking more than 2,000 childminding hours. Ms Tan said that beneficiaries have shared that they are able to perform at their jobs better because they found someone they could entrust their kids to when they are at work. GROWING THE PROGRAMME She said that an app is also being developed to help the mothers register themselves as users and childminders so they can find one another easily through technology-enabled matching.  “We are looking into viable childminding or nanny training that would be affordable and easily accessible to help the childminders with skills development and professionalisation,” she said. The success of the pilot has Ms Tan eyeing an expansion. “We hope that it can grow into a nationalised programme for the low-income community that’s supported by private and public resources to enable underprivileged women to get back into the workforce, and also for childminder moms to also be able to make an income from providing this care support,” she said. Already, the pool of childminders is expanding.  Mothers from different neighbourhoods are being trained and coached in community outreach and organising Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Social and Family Development Seah Kian Peng said: \"We should allow social enterprises like these to grow. Many schemes can co-exist, and this is a good initiative, to give these women from low-income families to go to work, and to allow the childminders to earn some income. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/childminder-childcare-she-is-like-a-mother-to-me-10682230"}, {"datetime": "12 Sep 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["entrepreneurship", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "The Singaporean serial entrepreneur who kept failing, until he got a lucky break", "content": " SINGAPORE: When his first business, a construction and interior design firm, failed in 1997, entrepreneur Leonard Lim found himself struggling, financially and mentally. He had lost a chunk of money in the business and ended up in debt, to the tune of a few hundred thousand dollars. “We owed the suppliers money, projects were half done and debt collectors turned up at my door. It was quite upsetting; my mother and everyone was quite stressed,” he recalled. “I couldn’t see a way out of it. I even had to ask for an allowance from my mum. It was sad and embarrassing.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The then 27-year-old went fishing to de-stress, but that turned out to be more depressing. “I went to the Kallang River on a daily basis, and I just sat there,” he recounted. “I spent five, six months just fishing every day. And believe it or not, I didn’t catch a single fish.” This local inventor went on to start several businesses over the next few years – and failed each time. But he persevered, driven by his childhood dream to run his own company, and finally succeeded. Today, he is the founder and chief executive officer of Omnisense Systems, a company that has revolutionised the way fever screening is done, with its made-in-Singapore thermal sensors. Singapore is not lacking in inventors and inventions, from square milk bottles to a drink-mixing machine, yet many of these creators, like Mr Lim, have kept low profiles, as the four-part series Made in Singapore finds out. FALLING BACK ON RATIONS In Mr Lim’s case, his entrepreneurial journey is peppered with failures, some lucky breaks and life lessons. Not academically inclined, he did not do well in his A Levels. He embarked on a part-time economics degree but gave it up and started working as a salesperson for an exhibition company, which folded a few months after he joined. With some of his ex-colleagues, they started a company installing door frames and kitchen cabinets for condominium projects. It was his first business, at the age of 24, and he was excited at the prospects. The firm lasted three years. “The company ran into cash-flow issues, and in my opinion, they were caused by some dishonest practices by my partners. (It was) my fault as well, since I missed many signs until it was too late,” he said. I didn’t handle the situation very well. That episode left him broke, in a funk and back to picking up fishing (unsuccessfully) to deal with the situation. After a few months “in limbo”, he set up a small internet business, but that failed to take off. Once again, he found himself broke, but he was more prepared this time. “I had stocked up on some canned food and rice at home so that when I was really broke, at least I could fall back on my ‘rations’,” said Mr Lim, who had already moved to his own HDB flat. He also joined a church group, whose members gave him moral support. And he started doing volunteer work with underprivileged children, which, in turn, helped him. “Through those children, I started to understand myself much better,\" he said. I was able to identify some counter-productive emotional feelings I had and learnt to deal with them. I also found a more stable job. TAKING A CHANCE DURING SARS After a few years, Mr Lim felt the itch to start a business again. This time, he saw an opportunity during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003. The Defence Science and Technology Agency was then exploring the option of using an infrared system to identify those with a fever, he recalled. “While everybody in those days was trying not to go out, I actually went around looking for these systems,” he said. “It was a national crisis, so a quick solution was really required to manage the situation.” He had always been fascinated with infrared technology, having watched a video on a British tank that used the technology during his secondary school days in the 1980s. From his market research during the Sars period, he found that there were few systems in the market, while the existing ones, he felt, were too “crude” and “clumsy” to do the job. He quit his job and joined a friend’s IT start-up to do development work on that project, to his mother’s disappointment. “When everybody was afraid of losing their job because of the economy … and people were being retrenched, I still had my job and I quit,” he said. “As far as she was concerned, it was an extremely illogical decision.” His new company faced a challenge getting its hands on an infrared camera, which was a controlled item, and the licence application took a few months. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The firm worked “non-stop” on the project in order to push its system into the market “fast enough”. Apart from dipping into his savings, Mr Lim borrowed some S$40,000 from his mother for the project. But when it was finally market-ready, the firm suffered a setback. “We had made an appointment with the testing agency … to validate the system,” he recalled. “(But) the government announced that all these screening measures would be terminated. “We lost three to four months and maybe over S$40,000 … which (mostly) didn’t belong to me.” He learned a few things, however. “First of all, I think speed to market was quite important. Second, we realised that the system itself still had a lot of gaps, which I think needed to be bridged,” he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Owing to that experience with infrared technology, he found another job dealing in such systems but then left the firm after two years because of a disagreement. STAFF OFFERED TO WORK FOR FREE In 2006, Mr Lim started Omnisense Systems to develop night-vision products for commercial applications. It exposed him to financial hardship again. Back then, such products were essentially for the military market, so his company had to spend a couple of years learning to redevelop the products. Things got desperate, however, when the 2008 financial crisis hit hard – and a corporate funder pulled out. “I was quite devastated when the news was broken to me,” he recalled. We were left with nothing. We had no money for salaries. But several of his staff offered to work for free. “I was very touched by such a gesture at that point in time. And I thought that people did believe in the things we were doing.” While looking for other opportunities for the company, he got a lucky break when the Influenza A (H1N1) virus hit home in 2009. He decided to revisit the fever screening system. “There were quite a lot of requirements, and people looking for fever screening systems, so we took the opportunity and went into this market,” he said. Based on his earlier experience, he developed a new system, one that was more accurate, affordable and easier to use. The big break came when the company tendered for and won a contract with the Education Ministry, beating out several major players in the market. After that, it started to showcase its products more aggressively. “The sales started rolling in. We got our first hospital deal, which was quite significant during those days (2010). In fact, that system is still operating today,” he said proudly. He reckoned that a few hundred of its systems are now deployed across Singapore, from hospitals to museums to Changi Airport. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “It was a very satisfying experience, not only because we made some money, but also because we felt that we had done something that not many people could have,” he added. Over the years, however, his struggles with his business and finances took a toll on his family life. In the initial years of Omnisense Systems, he was constantly under financial pressure, he admitted, even though his then wife was working and able to manage most of the household expenses. “But my personal financial hardship soon affected the relationship, and we divorced around 2012. My son was around six then,” said Mr Lim, who has since remarried and also has a two-year-old daughter now. IN A BETTER PLACE NOW Omnisense Systems, which started with three staff, has now expanded to more than 40 people, in Singapore and now Taiwan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In 2016, Singapore Exchange-listed BH Global Corporation bought a 51-per-cent stake in the company, giving it – and Mr Lim – a major boost. “The nature of our business revolves very heavily around development work. So the cost of development and trying to push products into the market is quite significant,” he said. “As a private company with very limited finances, we came to a point where it was very difficult for us to continue without external financial support.” Now that the firm has a development centre in Taiwan, it can “develop products and manufacture them in a way that we couldn’t have done (before)”. It is also looking to fine-tune its fever screening systems and explore the maritime market, hoping to make a mark overseas. Financially, Mr Lim is also in a better place but has “not yet made (his) fortune”, as he has reinvested most of his income into his thermography and night vision business. His failures and personal crises over the years, including his utilities being disconnected and his car being repossessed, have moulded him into the person he is today, he said – more humble, with a sense of perspective and better self-awareness. “I’m glad there was quite a fair bit of failure quite early in my life. That built me up,” he said. “Through all those failures, I realised that, very often in a crisis, there are a lot of opportunities.” He advised entrepreneurs struggling today to be patient and to develop emotional stamina. “For every great journey, obstacles and trials should be expected. We need to find the correct motivation to push on,” he said. “There’s also a time to give up. Knowing when to give up or alter course is a difficult but important decision to make. There’s no shame in failure; recognise when we make a mistake … learn from it and move on.” The series Made in Singapore tells the stories of eight inventors and their inventions. Watch it here.

Fandi stayed true to his words from pre-match and made seven changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Mauritius last Friday, with 18-year-old Jacob Mahler making his debut on Tuesday. The game also saw Gabriel Quak make his first appearance in national colours in more than a year, while Warriors midfielder Ho Wai Loon came on in the second half for his first Singapore cap as well.  \"(I am) very happy for Jacob Mahler. He's one of the best (players on the pitch) today, fighting hard inside,\" Fandi said of the young midfielder after the game.  \"He's a true professional at 18 ... He never reacts, he never retaliates (despite getting kicked). \"His lung is bigger than a lot of our players. He can run and run. He looks very clumsy and slow, but he gets stuck in and is not afraid. I think he has a good future.\"  Singapore were hardly troubled by a Fiji side which stands 165th in the FIFA ranking - four spots above the Lions - apart from an early scare that came in the second minute.    Roy Krishna - one of the only two professional footballers in the Fiji team - was left unmarked inside the danger area for a shot, but goalkeeper Hassan Sunny pulled off a decent save. The Lions had their first chance in the 11th minute, with Ikhsan's effort taking a heavy deflection before it was hacked off the line.  It was from the resulting corner that they broke the deadlock though, as Hariss met Zulfahmi Arifin's delivery with a thumping header.  The lead was doubled just over a minute later, with Ikhsan producing a composed finish his dad would have been proud of, after breaking the offside trap to latch onto a glorious pass from Gabriel Quak.  The Fijians slowly grew into the game after that, pinging the ball around. But they were unable to carve out any clear opportunities against the backline marshalled by Baihakki Khazan and Irfan Fandi.  Instead, it was Singapore who came closest to scoring again in the 71st minute. A well-worked move saw Khairul Amri set his fellow substitute Shahril Ishak up for a volley, which Fiji goalkeeper Misiwani Nairube did well to stop.  Neither side were able to find the net after that and Singapore were able to see off 10-man Fiji, who had Kolinio Sivoki sent off after he jutted his knee into Mahler's back late on.    Fandi said after the match that he was happy with the team's overall performance and added he was glad to see the young players \"stepping up very well\".  \"This (win) will settle down a lot of youngsters. We want them to get the confidence ... They got a win and this will bolster them,\" said Fandi.  \"The commitment was there, the camaraderie was there. But there's still a long way to go ... We need to tighten up the midfield. It takes time but we don't have much FIFA dates.\"  Fandi also cautioned against expecting too much from the team, particularly at the Suzuki Cup.  \"Football is a funny game. Yesterday you may have played well, but tomorrow you don't play well. It's good to stay positive and we hope (the fans) will support us.  \"We will do our best but we can't promise you (much).

Shawalludin Sa'adon, 28, was part of a group of four men who attacked a 34-year-old man, Mr Satheesh Kumar Managoran, and his friend Naveen Lal Pillar, 29. Mr Satheesh, who had been stabbed by Shawalludin's co-accused Muhammad Khalid Kamarudin, died from wounds to his head and back. The incident occurred in the early morning of Mar 12 last year, when Shawalludin was working as a waiter at Postbar, a club in St James Power Station. Mr Satheesh and Mr Naveen were at a table in Postbar with three others, when Shawalludin noticed that a liquor bottle from the table was placed on the floor. He told the group that the bottle should not be left on the floor. This sparked an argument between Shawalludin, Mr Satheesh and Mr Naveen. Shawalludin's supervisors intervened and told him to step out of the bar to prevent further misunderstanding. He did so, but \"felt aggrieved by his treatment\", the court heard. ACCUSED CALLS SECRET SOCIETY FRIEND TO RALLY MEMBERS He contacted a co-accused, Muhammad Hisham Hassan, 28, and told him that he wanted to rally members of their secret society at Postbar to confront Mr Satheesh and Mr Naveen. Hisham agreed, and he arrived at St James Power Station with the two other co-accused, Khalid and Muhammad Faizal Md Jamal. After advising Shawalludin, Khalid and Faizal to \"wait for the best opportunity\" as there were uniformed police officers nearby, Hisham left the group to make some calls. When Mr Satheesh and his group were outside a private-hire car discussing seating arrangement, Shawalludin approached them and initiated confrontation, Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong said. Khalid punched Mr Satheesh and stabbed him on his head and back with a foldable knife. Shawalludin joined in the attack together with Faizal by punching and kicking Mr Satheesh several times all over his body, the prosecutor said. \"The deceased staggered towards the rear of the vehicle before falling onto the road,\" he said. Shawalludin, Khalid and Faizal continued to punch and kick him, before turning to attack Mr Naveen. HE CONTINUED WORKING, FOUND OUT THAT ONE OF THE MEN DIED After the attacks, the three men walked away from the scene, and Shawalludin continued working after washing the blood off his hands. While Shawalludin was in Postbar, he found out from his colleagues that Mr Satheesh had died. He messaged Hisham to tell him this, and Hisham told him to \"run far far\". After collecting his pay for the day's job, Shawalludin left St James Power Station and later went home, where he was arrested by the police. An autopsy certified Mr Satheesh's cause of death as stab wounds to the thorax and head. Mr Naveen suffered bodily pain. Shawalludin on Tuesday pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with common intention. The court heard that he was convicted of theft with common intention in 2006, and was admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre in 2010 for consumption of morphine. He will be back in court for sentencing next month. Hisham has been sentenced to 18 months' jail for harbouring Khalid, who was evading arrest, while Khalid faces a murder charge and Faizal faces a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/secret-society-member-who-hurt-man-in-fatal-fight-at-st-james-10704578"}, {"datetime": "11 Sep 2018 12:45PM", "tags": ["real estate", "property"], "author": "", "title": "Real estate agency HSR fined for failing to properly advise investors in Bangkok deal", "content": " SINGAPORE: Real estate agency HSR International Realtors has been fined S$12,500 over its agents' failure to properly advise investors of the risks involved in purchasing properties in Bangkok. For breaching the Council for Estate Agencies’ (CEA) Practice Guidelines, the agency was also barred from marketing or selling foreign properties for six months, starting Sep 10, CEA said in a media release on Tuesday (Sep 11). In 2014, two investors each purchased a unit in the Manhattan Park Peninsular project in Bangkok through HSR. They each paid a refundable S$3,000 booking fee and 30 per cent of the purchase price to the developer, Euro-Thai Property. One of the investors paid S$32,000 while the other paid S$20,327. Before the execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement a few days later, HSR's property agents were supposed to provide both investors with a written advisory message stating that they must conduct due diligence. This message would highlight the risks involved in buying foreign properties, and that their transactions were subject to foreign laws and to any change in policies and rules in Thailand.  However, HSR's property agents failed to do so. The agents also neglected to explain to the first investor that the Sale and Purchase Agreement did not contain a dispute resolution mechanism or a jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes, as required under CEA's guidelines. Subsequently, both investors were informed that the developer had abandoned the Manhattan Park Peninsular project and they were offered units in other developments instead. The first investor rejected the offer as he felt that the locations of the replacement units were not ideal. The second investor accepted the offer and paid an additional S$5,000 for 30 per cent of the replacement unit's purchase price. BE VIGILANT WHEN PURCHASING FOREIGN PROPERTIES: CEA In its press release, CEA advised potential investors to be wary of the pitfalls involved in foreign property transactions as they can be complex affairs that carry additional risks when compared with local property transactions. \"They should thus exercise due diligence before entering into any agreement to buy foreign properties,\" CEA said. \"In addition, consumers should exercise greater care and be more vigilant when purchasing foreign properties directly from foreign developers or when the intermediaries involved fall under the jurisdiction of another country.\" Consumers should also not rely solely on the advice of property agents, CEA said, adding that it has published a guide on buying foreign properties.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/real-estate-agency-hsr-fined-for-failing-to-properly-advise-10704268"}, {"datetime": "11 Sep 2018 12:25PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "MOH", "MCI"], "author": "", "title": "Public invited to give recommendations following SingHealth cyberattack", "content": " SINGAPORE: Members of the public who wish to offer recommendations on how to deal with cybersecurity attacks following the recent SingHealth data breach will be able to do so from now until Oct 31 at 5pm.

The cases usually involve businesses that have overseas dealings and use email as their main mode of communication, police said. In many of the cases, the scammers are believed to have hacked into either the email accounts of the victims or their suppliers to monitor their email correspondence. They would look out, in particular, for correspondence relating to ongoing negotiations or discussions on sales and purchase transactions.  They would then use the supplier’s email account or a spoof account, closely resembling that of the suppliers’, to ask victims to transfer payments to a bank account controlled by the scammers.  The police cited examples of spoofed email addresses, which they said often included slight misspellings or the replacement of letters, which may not be obvious at first glance: \n\n\n\n\n In order to deceive victims into thinking that the emails were genuine, the scammers may closely mimic the emails of the real suppliers.

In Singapore, where we are known for world-class efficiency and preparedness, it is not uncommon to even have a back-up plan for the back-up plan. This is not quite \"kiasuism\" at work; many simply see it as a sign of readiness, responsibility, even foresight. We could almost sum up our obsession with back-up plans like this: If Plan A is for attaining dreams, Plan B is for avoiding nightmares. Research suggests otherwise. Your back-up plan may well be the culprit that is making you fail on your goals.  Psychologists at the University of Zurich have found that back-up plans change the way we pursue a goal, and affect our probability of achieving it,  even if we never use the back-up plan. They believe that a back-up plan can constitute as an additional cost in terms of time and resources, which can undermine our motivation to persist with our first-choice plan. In another study, scientists at Wisconsin and Pennsylvania gave 160 university students a sentence-unscrambling challenge, with the promise of a energy bar if they performed well. Half of the students were told to think of ways to get free food in the campus should they fail to earn the energy bar.  At the end of the challenge, the students who were prompted to think of back-up plans fared significantly worse than those who did not think of a back-up plan. In my work as an executive coach, I found that executives who prepared back-up plans fell short on their goals more frequently, compared to those who went all-in. There are three reasons why your back-up plan can hurt your chances of success. IT WEAKENS YOUR CONFIDENCE The very nature of a back-up plan is to anticipate and prepare for failure. That is a pessimistic way to get started on any goal. Having a back-up plan can be a signal that you are planning for failure, which affects your confidence and the confidence others have in you.  In a survey reported by The Harvard Gazette, 62 percent of respondents thought that requesting a prenuptial agreement sends a negative signal about the future of the marriage. “It’s like you’re planning for divorce. It signals that you think there’s a positive probability for divorce,” said researcher Heather Mahar of Harvard Law School. Many studies have proven the power of visualisation to help individuals perform better. World-class athletes such as gold-medalist swimmer Missy Franklin mentally picture their success to draw themselves closer to their desired outcome. The converse also applies  – if you’re picturing and preparing for failure, you’re more likely to fail. IT LOWERS YOUR MOTIVATION The path to success is almost never smooth. If you’re pursuing something worthwhile, it is unlikely to be easy.  You may know the saying: “When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.” But when the going gets tough  –  and you have a Plan B  –  you’re more likely to give up than to tough it out.  This is probably why many in history have gone to great lengths to avoid a back-up plan. Ancient military commanders like Julius Caesar and Hernan Cortes would burn their ships the moment they reach the battlegrounds to banish any thought of a retreat.  The Japanese samurai warriors took this concept to a whole new level – failing a mission meant performing seppuku or honour suicide, first performed by the ancient samurai Minamoto no Yorimasa in 1180. Your back-up plan can make it too convenient to give up when you hit a temporary setback , one that is entirely possible to overcome. If you have a Plan B, your motivation may never be where it needs to be. Young entrepreneurs would know. The founders of HungryGoWhere, one of Singapore’s most successful startups, had no back-up plan when they started out – it was all-or-nothing. Co-founder Wong Hoong An has said in an interview: When we first started … we did not have startup grants, or MDA, there was nothing. So you had to have a business that works, and if it didn’t, there was no back-up plan. After you have a back-up plan, you might think you can stop thinking about it so it does not distract you. But it is still there, humming away quietly in the background of your mind. Its mere presence can affect your focus when you’re trying to make Plan A work. There is a real possibility that the back-up plan takes on a life of its own. It may spawn new ideas in your mind, evolving to become a viable, even more attractive alternative.  When I was a C-level executive of a large multinational company, I led teams of extremely talented individuals on time-sensitive, high-pressure projects. I noticed that the teams that were single-minded in their plans from the outset tend to deliver their best work in time, while others got mired in a number of red-herring alternatives that diluted their focus. HOW HAVING A ‘PLAN C’ CAN HELP YOU SUCCEED A senior executive that I coach loves back-up plans. He takes a lot of pride in coming up with solid Plan Bs. The problem is, they are so good, they compete with his original plan. Because of that, he would regularly fall short of achieving his targets. It was only when he let go of all his back-up plans, other than a basic safety net, did he finally succeed in following through on his Plan A. If the singular objective is to succeed on your goal, you might want to start thinking about Plan C instead of Plan B. Plan C is the option that protects you from the worst-case scenario, yet is in no way desirable enough to make failure acceptable. Plan C does not distract you from Plan A, because it is simply not good enough to be considered as an alternative. Yet it also disaster-proofs the outcome. That is what a safety net is for anyway  –  saving your life if you fall; it’s not meant to be a hammock. For this strategy to work, be sure that your Plan A is indeed the right one. Consider all alternatives objectively, some of our Plan Bs could have been Plan As had we evaluated them with more care. Here’s one way to approach the decision: Think about your Plan A almost as if you’re getting married to it. Move beyond the passion and excitement. Settle down and consider carefully. Do you really want to go through with this? How are you going to handle the rough patches? What do you need to do to make this work? Nothing less than a resounding \"yes\"’ would do. Because Plan B is like the college sweetheart who is still carrying a torch for you. And will be “here for you” when you run into problems with Plan A.

This comes as Parliament on Monday (Sep 10) passed amendments to the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act, which allow the Government to designate more no-smoking zones and give officers more enforcement powers. But the MPs said the Bill failed to address secondhand smoke from neighbours' homes. \"We are now doing a lot to protect people from secondhand smoke in public areas,\" Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng said. \"But the concern which has been raised in this House before is: What are we doing to protect people from secondhand smoke in their own homes?\" Tanjong Pagar GRC MP and surgeon Chia Shi-Lu said secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals, of which about 70 can cause cancer. \"It can lead to coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. It can cause asthma attacks, respiratory infections and sudden infant death syndrome,\" he added. \"There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.\" Over the years, Dr Chia said he has received numerous complaints from residents about the \"nuisance and unhealthy effects of neighbours’ secondhand smoke drifting into their flats\". RESIDENTS COMPLAIN Likewise, Mr Ng said many of his residents complain about being affected by secondhand smoke when neighbours smoke at their windows or balconies, especially as housing units are close to each other. \"Imagine being exposed to and having to tolerate secondhand smoke from your neighbours every day for years with the only reprieve being moving out altogether,\" he said. Jurong GRC MP Rahayu Mahzam recalled how one of her residents, a lung cancer survivor living in a condominium, had to constantly close his windows and stuff cloth into the gap below his main door because his neighbour had a habit of smoking at the window. Although the resident approached the condo managing agent and National Environment Agency for help, Mdm Rahayu said \"there was little that could be done\" except for advising and encouraging the neighbour to stop smoking from the window. \"The situation improved after some time but would recur once in a while,\" she added. \"This is clearly not the most ideal resolution of the matter.\" Nee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah said conflicts between HDB neighbours involving cigarette smoke entering other houses are \"increasingly on the rise\". \"For years, non-smokers have been complaining about neighbours smoking at their window ledges, along common corridors and at landings between staircases,\" Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Gan Thiam Poh said. \"Families with vulnerable young children and elderly members are particularly concerned.\" WHAT CAN AUTHORITIES DO? To protect these individuals, Mr Ng asked if the law could be extended to prohibit smoking in a private home at a window or door that is within five metres of a neighbour’s windows and doors. \"These restrictions are based on the logic that cigarette smoke can be expelled up to five metres away,\" he said. Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira proposed that those who want to smoke in their homes must ensure that cigarette smoke does not escape their flats. \"In other words, windows and doors should be closed when smoking. Smokers may consider installing an air filter in their rooms. They should not be standing near the windows, doors or corridors to smoke,\" she said. \"If smoke is detected outside of the flat, the resident should then be considered to have violated the law.\" Mdm Rahayu suggested penalties for expelling secondhand smoke out of a residential home. \"If someone repeatedly commits the offence, it would be possible to track the unit from which the smoke comes from and issue a notice,\" she said, adding that enforcement should be done in phases, with a warning issued first.  \"In any case, the legislation would send a strong message about the seriousness of the matter and deter residents from smoking at the windows or balconies.\" Dr Chia wants a tougher approach, calling for smoking in HDB flats to be banned. He said smoking areas can be set up near each HDB block. \"This approach also protects the health of smokers' families,\" he said. SHOULD AUTHORITIES STEP IN? However, Mdm Rahayu acknowledged that there are residents who feel strongly about regulation that \"impinges on what they can or cannot do at home\". Mr Gan said \"very unhappy\" smokers have told him that they want a limit to the measures against smoking, including the 10 per cent increase to the tobacco excise duty. \"They ask for understanding from non-smokers and protest the deprivation of their spaces of freedom and enjoyment,\" he said. Still, other MPs had a different opinion. While \"everyone deserves the freedom to do what he or she likes in their own homes as long as we do not break the law or harm anyone\", Dr Lee said smoking at home can harm family members and neighbours. Mr Ng pointed to a US ban on smoking in public housing to improve indoor air quality and reduce residents’ exposure to secondhand smoke. \"According to a nationwide study they conducted, people who lived in homes where smoking was prohibited were 60 per cent more likely to quit smoking for at least 30 days than people without this prohibition,\" he added. GOVERNMENT WARY OF SUCH MEASURES Responding to the MPs' suggestions, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said \"regulation must be balanced against privacy concerns\". In February, Dr Khor had said in Parliament that smoking within a residence is beyond the jurisdiction of the Government. \"Homes are private spaces; we need to be mindful that not everyone would support the view that the Government should intrude into one’s private space on the issue of smoking,\" she said on Monday. \"Moreover, if we were to prohibit smoking in one’s own home, it would inevitably entail bringing to bear the necessary investigation and enforcement powers in our homes. We must not take this lightly. \"Such an intrusive regulatory approach to tackling neighbourly issues could ultimately be even more detrimental to community harmony and ownership.\" On the US ban on smoking within public housing estates, Dr Khor said it applies only to public housing estates for low-income residents through conditions in the tenancy agreements. \"The context of the US smoking ban is very different and we do need to consider our local circumstances before adapting practices from abroad,\" she said. As for the suggestion of setting up a designated smoking area (DSA) in residential estates, Dr Khor said the heartlands are \"where our young children and youth spend their time daily\". Furthermore, the fact that housing estates are designed so that HDB blocks are well-connected and dense means it is challenging to find suitable and less visible locations for the DSAs, she said. \"DSAs typically serve as congregation points for smokers,\" she added. \"The daily sight of people gathering to smoke at DSAs at residential areas may give our young the impression that it is normal to smoke. As much as possible, we want to avoid this.\" Instead, Dr Khor said the Government has been addressing secondhand smoke in housing estates by prohibiting smoking in common areas, including at the lift lobbies, corridors and staircase landings. \"Ultimately, living in the community is about give and take,\" she added. \"I urge all smokers to be considerate, and to refrain from smoking in a way that would negatively affect others.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mps-dangers-of-secondhand-smoke-smoking-in-homes-10701812"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 07:59PM", "tags": ["personal mobility devices", "transport"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "MPs suggest ways to boost enforcement against errant PMD users, retailers", "content": " SINGAPORE: A mobile app for members of the public to report errant retailers and GPS trackers to monitor personal mobility devices (PMDs). These are some ways in which the government can rev up enforcement on errant users and retailers, several MPs suggested during the Parliamentary debate on the Land Transport (Enforcement Measures) Bill on Monday (Sep 10). Before the Bill was passed, Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min highlighted some of its key points, including compulsory registration of e-scooters from early 2019 and ensuring that all motorised PMDs be compliant with fire safety standards from 2021. Additionally, Dr Lam said that the Bill will strengthen the Land Transport Authority’s enforcement capacity by enabling the appointment of outsourced enforcement officers and giving them limited enforcement powers. MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Joan Pereira stressed that the Government will need to consider having more enforcement officers or use technology to make an impact against PMD users and cyclists who break the law. “So far, the enforcement has been a bit of a hit and miss. It is not easy to catch errant ones as there are so many users and they are everywhere, even riding their devices along common corridors and void decks of our HDB blocks, shopping malls, hawker centres, and even community centres and MRT stations,” said Ms Pereira. In order to keep pace with the number of PMDs users. Ms Pereira suggested installing microchips with GPS tracking capability in PMDs. Her fellow MP from Tanjong Pagar GRC Melvin Yong also suggested that LTA use technology to reduce the reliance on manpower for enforcement. He recommended having a common fleet management system to track and monitor the use of all active mobility devices so as to efficiently deploy limited ground resources. MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Gan Thiam Poh suggested using street cameras to identify reckless users. In addition to enforcement action against the users, MPs also stressed the importance of compliance from retailers. Dr Lee Bee Wah, MP for Nee Soon GRC, suggested that the Government take “strong enforcement action” on outlets which sell devices that do not comply with the new regulations, or perform illegal modifications on PMDs. MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Ang Hin Kee called for LTA to introduce a mobile app for members of the public to report retailers who advertise or sell illegal devices. For the benefit of prospective buyers, Mr Ang also recommended that LTA compile a list of PMD retailers who sell devices that comply with the government’s regulations. MANDATORY INSURANCE FOR PMD USERS?  Additionally, the MPs also discussed the possibility of imposing mandatory insurance for PMD users. This, said Mr Yong, would enable victims in pedestrian accidents involving PMD users to receive a “justified” compensation. Offending users too would not be able to escape the consequences of their actions, he added.  “Adopting a similar liability and compensation framework as per motor vehicles could go a long way in ensuring that the victims would not be overly burdened by medical expenses in the event of a serious accident,” Mr Yong said. Mr Zainal Sapari, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, suggested that users purchase personal liability insurance tied to the registrations of their PMDs, explaining that compensation issues and civil lawsuits can further complicate the situation for the different parties involved in accidents. MP for Jurong GRC Rahayu Mahzam further stressed the importance of mandatory insurance as it protects both the injured pedestrian and the rider. “If (PMD users) are found to be personally liable for the damages and do not have funds to cover payment for compensation or injuries and damages, the injured pedestrian may be left out in the cold,” she argued. Additionally, MP for Tampines GRC Cheng Li Hui suggested that food delivery service providers ensure that their riders be covered with blanket third-party liability insurance. “We know by now that incidents caused by PMDs can be fatal or cause very serious injuries. The victims’ medical bills can run high and therefore mandating some form of insurance coverage for users who utilise PMDs as a tool for work is definitely beneficial for all stakeholders. Delivery service providers should take charge of their riders and “incentivise or penalise them according to their track record,” Ms Cheng added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mps-suggest-ways-to-boost-enforcement-against-errant-pmd-users-10702392"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 07:21PM", "tags": ["Ng Eng Hen", "National Service"], "author": "", "title": "About 350 default on National Service obligations each year: Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: Over the past 10 years, there has been an average of about 350 National Service (NS) defaulters each year, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in a written parliamentary reply on Monday (Sep 10).  These defaulters either failed to register or enlist for NS, or failed to return after their exit permit expired.

Among those who defaulted, about one-third have been arrested or have come forward to address their offences, Dr Ng said.

Dr Maliki was responding to a question by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Leon Perera regarding Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) NSFs who need financial assistance. \"AWOL is a serious offence, so SAF will continue to take stern disciplinary action against servicemen who commit AWOL offences,\" he said. However, Dr Maliki said SAF tries to understand the circumstances these NSFs face, pointing out that the number of NSFs who receive financial assistance but still commit AWOL offences is \"very small\". Of the cases reported in 2017, only one serviceman went AWOL despite getting financial help, he said. Dr Maliki said an average of 120 NSFs receive the Term Financial Assistance (TFA) each year. TFA is a form of monthly assistance that can be provided as long as the NSFs are serving their full-time National Service. The sums given range from less than S$100 to a few thousand dollars each month, for an average of eight months, he said. \"The TFA eligibility criteria and quantum provided are similar to public financial assistance schemes,\" Dr Maliki said. \"Family size, income and expenditure needs are considered and additional support is provided for families with school-going children and/or members with recurrent medical conditions.\" Dr Maliki added that when processing applications, commanders conduct interviews and home visits to better understand the NSFs' family situation.

The Elections Department (ELD) said in a factsheet on Monday that the proposed amendment simplifies the formula to compute the election deposit to it being based on an elected Member of Parliament’s (MP) fixed monthly allowance, rounded to the nearest S$500. Given that the current fixed monthly allowance is S$13,750, the election deposit will be rounded down to S$13,500. Today, the computation is a sum equal to 8 per cent of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest S$500. This works out to S$14,500, which was collected at General Election 2015, it added. Another change tabled was for the payment of the election deposit. ELD said the amended Bill deletes the reference to cash payment and, in its place, provides the option for candidates to pay the amount by electronic fund transfer systems. Other payment methods of bank draft and certified cheque currently provided in the Act will continue to be available, it said. Additionally, to facilitate the smooth and orderly conduct of nomination proceedings, the amendment Bill proposes that only aspiring candidates who meet the following conditions may be allowed to enter the nomination place: ELD will also change the current method of deciding the number of polling agents at a polling station. Rather than having one polling agent to a booth, the amended law will allow for polling agents \"proportionate to the total number of voters allotted to the polling station\". This will give more flexibility to the ELD to design polling stations for efficient operation, it said. Resources such as electronic voter registration can be used, for example.  The increased number of non-constituency MPs (NCMPs) from 9 to 12 minus the total number of elected Opposition MPs was also formally included into the legislation. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said in 2016 he intends to raise the number of NCMP seats so that there will be at least 12 opposition faces in Parliament from the next General Election. The amendment Bill also replicates some of the changes made to the Presidential Elections Act in 2017. These changes include stating the Returning Officer will only consider markings that are made within the demarcated area of a ballot paper, and removing the need to apply for a vote recount if the difference in the number of votes between the top candidate and any other candidate contesting the same election falls within the stipulated limit of 2 per cent or less.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/general-election-deposit-singapore-payment-methods-10701504"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 01:51PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Ambulance driver who shared photo of hanged maid fined", "content": " SINGAPORE: An ambulance driver who took a photo of a dead domestic worker and sent it to a chat group was fined S$1,500 on Monday (Sep 10). Shaik Haziq Fahmi Shaik Nasair Johar, 30, who has since lost his job, pleaded guilty to one charge under the Official Secrets Act. He was an emergency ambulance vehicle driver with Unistrong, a company contracted to respond to medical emergencies. On Feb 1 last year, Haziq was on duty at the Marine Parade Fire Post when he and his team were dispatched to a room where a maid was found hanging from a fan. His team members carried out the necessary procedures to search for signs of life. The co-accused, Nurizzah Afiqah Hussain, a 27-year-old Unistrong emergency ambulance paramedic, pronounced the woman dead. After this, Haziq and his team members were supposed to leave the room. However, he used his mobile phone to take a photograph of the hanging body, while Nurizzah shone a torchlight on her. They left the scene and returned to their private ambulance, and Haziq said that he took the photo \"as it was his first time attending to a case of hanging\". He intended to share the photograph with his station mates in a chat group they had, Deputy Public Prosecutor Selene Yap said. Haziq sent the photo to his chat group, despite having signed a contract with a confidentiality agreement when he started work. Nurizzah, who was in the chat group, received the photo and sent it to her boyfriend, a third co-accused Fazli Hisham Mohd Fairuz Shah, 28. Fazli sent the photo to another chat group and the photo was forwarded, eventually ending up on Facebook. The photographs began circulating on social media, and the agent of the maid found out about the photos and told the maid's employer about it. The employer, in turn, informed the police, who arrested Haziq a few days later. In court on Monday, Haziq's defence lawyer Amarick Gill said his client was remorseful and had been terminated from his job. \"He realises his mistake,\" he said. \"This was something that was very sensitive and he should have been much more careful and he recognises that.\" He said Haziq had sent photos to his colleagues and did not intend to personally disseminate it on any public forum. Ms Yap responded that this was \"hardly a mitigating factor\", as the fact remained that it was disseminated quite extensively. District Judge Marvin Bay imposed a fine of S$1,500, as the prosecution had asked for. \"Your act of disseminating an image of a hanged domestic worker through a chat that ended up on social media is deeply disturbing,\" he told Haziq. \"You were not tasked to photograph the worker, that's the work of the police investigator. I should point out that your act can cause intense anguish to the family of the deceased worker, who would be in a state of grief and shock.\" For his crime, Haziq could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to S$2,000. Nurizzah was fined S$3,000 last month, while Fazli has yet to be dealt with.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ambulance-driver-who-shared-photo-of-hanged-maid-fined-10701512"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 01:49PM", "tags": ["VERS", "housing", "Parliament"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Government will not rule out possibility of private developers having role in VERS: Lawrence Wong", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Government will not rule out the possibility of giving private developers a role in the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on Monday (Sep 10). Responding to a question from MP Cheryl Chan, Mr Wong said the Government already “inject(s) some private development” in the redevelopment process for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). But he stressed that the Government’s aim is to redevelop public housing estates. “So we will ensure that any redevelopment is done in a way that preserves the character of our HDB towns, and supports HDB’s mission to provide affordable and quality homes for Singaporeans,” he said.  Ms Chan had previously suggested in a media report that HDB can consider having precincts selected for VERS to be potentially redeveloped by private developers. She had pointed out that doing so could make VERS an attractive option for homeowners, subjected to certain conditions.  A number of MPs also raised supplementary questions related to VERS, which would allow HDB flat owners to vote on whether or not they want their flats to be sold back to the Government for redevelopment at around the 70-year mark of their lease. This includes questions about the guidelines by which precincts are selected for VERS, the percentage of votes needed to qualify for the scheme, and how much advance notice the HDB would give residents if their precincts were selected.  However, Mr Wong said that while he understands MPs and residents’ concerns, it would be premature to talk about the details at this point, as the Government is currently undertaking a “thorough study” on how to go about implementing the scheme. “These are issues that we will study, and we will take into consideration timelines, ensuring that if and when we are ready for VERS, we provide adequate time to notify the residents who are affected,” he said.   Mr Wong also added that the SERS programme would not be held back or delayed, in light of the VERS announcements.  “We have already selected many of the sites with high development potential,” he said. “I think there are a few more sites, and we will continue to implement SERS in the coming years.” In response to a question from MP Denise Phua on the possible acrimony between neighbours as a result of VERS, Mr Wong said that he is mindful of the concern, but the process of getting votes for upgrading is not new to the HDB. “We do have a mechanism to get residents to vote for upgrading,” he said. “We have some experience, we will build on that experience, we will see what has been done in the private sector, and we will work out the best possible arrangement for VERS.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/vers-government-will-not-rule-out-role-of-private-developers-10701518"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 01:47PM", "tags": ["National Library Board"], "author": "", "title": "11 complaints to National Library Board on homosexual content since 2014", "content": " SINGAPORE: The National Library Board (NLB) has received 11 complaints from the public in the last four years over titles with homosexual content, said Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran in Parliament on Monday (Sep 10). In response to a question from Nominated Member of Parliament Kok Heng Leun, Mr Iswaran revealed that eight were eventually moved to sections for older readers and three were assessed as suitable to stay put in the section for children and young adults. NLB also received feedback on 23 titles due to race, religion and “other topics”, he added. For these, seven were moved to sections for older readers and eight remained in their original locations. The other eight were Malay children’s titles - Agama, Tamadun Dan Arkeologi (or Religion, Civilisation and Archeology) - which were withdrawn in June last year due to “controversial religious content”. The latter series was alleged to have contained material insulting religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism. Three of the books with homosexual content were initially set to be destroyed in 2014 in a move that attracted global reportage. But after national backlash in the form of petitions and protests, two were moved to the adult section instead: And Tango Makes Three, about two male penguins raising a baby and The White Swan Express, which features children adopted by gay parents. Who's In My Family?, which mentions gay couples, was pulped. The illegality of sex between men in Singapore has re-emerged as a hot-button topic after India repealed a similar British colonial-era legislation last week. Law Minister K Shanmugam and veteran diplomat Tommy Koh have spoken on the matter and thousands have signed petitions to either scrap or keep the penal code provision known as \"377A\". Mr Iswaran said the NLB selects titles “based on a collection policy which aims to provide age-appropriate and diverse reading material”. “The NLB seeks to balance the need for a wide-ranging library collection with sensitivity towards our community norms,” he added. “Beyond its team of book selectors, the NLB also relies on pre-publication information from publishers and vendors, and reviews from library journals. In some instances, review copies are requested so that the NLB can assess these books in greater detail. “In addition, the Library Consultative Panel, comprising citizens from a wide cross-section of our society, was established in 2015 to provide diverse community perspectives and recommendations to NLB on books which are being reviewed due to content concerns raised by members of the public.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-library-complaints-homosexual-race-religion-10701516"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 01:21PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Man who sexually abused stepdaughter for almost 8 years gets 7.5 years' jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: For almost eight years, a young girl suffered sexual abuse at the hands of her stepfather. It took physical violence for the girl, who is now 23, to lodge a police report against the 45-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect her identity. District Judge Kenneth Yap sentenced the man to seven-and-a-half years in jail on Monday (Sep 10). The girl was only three years old when her mother married the man, but it was only when she was a teenager that she realised that he was not her biological father. The abuse began when she reached puberty in upper primary, continuing until September 2014. In 2006, when the girl was about 12 years old and in primary school, her stepfather approached her in the flat they lived in. He first ensured that no other family members were there to see what he was about to do, then he molested her. What started out as hugging, mouth-kissing and molesting over the clothes became skin-on-skin molestation, and eventually, the man asked his stepdaughter to perform sexual acts on him. By the time she was in secondary school the girl feared her stepfather, as she was subject to sexual abuse on an almost weekly basis, and her previous attempts at resisting him were futile. So she complied with his directions. The abuse continued through secondary school to when the victim was in polytechnic, the court heard. The man committed the offences when he was alone with his stepdaughter, or when the other family members were asleep or not watching. He warned the girl not to reveal the incidents to anyone, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana said. \"Fearing reprisal, the victim complied and did not break her silence,\" she said. \"She finally disclosed the incidents to her family after the accused caused hurt to her on Sep 7, 2014.\" HE HIT, KICKED HER AFTER SHE REFUSED HIS ADVANCES On that day, the man waited for his stepdaughter to return home from work, which she had started just a month before. He was unhappy that she had been coming home late after work, and told her to tell him when she was reaching home that day. When she reached the void deck of the home at about 10pm, he asked her to follow him to an open space near the lift lobby, where he asked her to perform sexual acts on him. She refused to comply, and they argued - the man asked her why she was saying no, and she answered that she did not like it. He asked her again, saying that she had performed similar acts on him previously. He also asked if she had a boyfriend, and asked her to quit her job. Infuriated by her answers and refusal, the man hit her on the head and kicked her body. When his shoe came off, he used it to hit her on the shoulder. His stepdaughter cried and shouted for help but no one came to her aid. The assault ceased only when she apologised to her stepfather. When she returned home, her mother and brother saw that she was in tears. She told them that her stepfather had hit her, and they called the police. While on the way to hospital she told her brother, grandparents and aunt that her stepfather had been sexually abusing her. The next day, she moved to live with her grandparents and lodged a police report a few days later with encouragement from her family.  She was also afraid that her stepfather may also sexually abuse her two younger stepsisters, who were the man's own children. ACCUSED SUFFERS FROM PAEDOPHILIC DISORDER The man pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual penetration of a minor, one charge of voluntarily causing hurt and one charge of committing an obscene act with a child. In the course of police investigations, he admitted to molesting his stepdaughter, saying that he committed the crimes as he was \"curious, drunk and stressed\". An assessment by the Institute of Mental Health found that he suffers from paedophilic disorder and had problems with alcohol consumption. He was assessed with a high risk of reoffending. As for the victim, counselling sessions she attended after the matter was disclosed revealed that she was visibly traumatised by the incidents, exhibiting symptoms of emotional trauma such as disassociation, lack of sleep and fear of meeting her stepfather. The man, who was unrepresented, said he committed the offences because he was under the influence of alcohol and under great pressure. Asking for a jail term of seven years and six months to be imposed, the prosecutor said that \"this is an extremely appalling case where the victim, a young adolescent girl, had been subjected to years of sexual exploitation at the hands of her stepfather\". The prosecutor added: \"The victim, who is now 23 years old, suffered the accused’s sexual abuse for close to a third of her life and this has evidently left her with irreparable harm.\" For sexual penetration of a minor, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined, or both. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story stated that the man could have been jailed for up to 20 years, fined, caned, or any combination of these punishments. This is wrong. For this charge, the punishment is up to 10 years' jail, a fine, or both.

New technology, big data and artificial intelligence have transformed the world of goods and services into an on-demand economy where new products come online non-stop, rapidly shortening the product cycle. Now you can buy anything, anytime, anywhere – so long as you have an account with an online retailer like Alibaba or Zalora. You can also get food delivered with Deliveroo or Foodpanda and call up a ride with a Grab app. CHOICE, LIKE A BUFFET  Welcome to the age of disruption. In this new economic reality, the most successful enterprises are highly agile and responsive. Firms adopting these business models may require fewer but more skilful workers. In this new environment, the workers who succeed are adept in many areas and obtain new, appropriate skills every few years. These individuals work and live in a digitalised workplace. Those at the frontlines have more choice to work on projects they like and choose where and when they work. When we go for a buffet dinner, we select what we like to eat. For workers in this new economy, they choose work from which they derive satisfaction and earn labour income. Many of them might not have employers. They are gig workers, Grab drivers included. The employment relationship between companies and workers is vastly different from the classic full-time job that provides an agreed compensation package. Companies need a diverse portfolio of teams of workers who can work flexibly, but this has massive drawbacks that are not immediately foreseen or felt. The Government must provide the necessary institutional framework to ensure that firms can compete and workers are gainfully employed in this on-demand economy, and mitigate its snags.  The gig economy never aimed to provide individuals with full-time employment and retirement benefits, and didn’t pretend to. It certainly helped those between jobs to earn some income. In this sense, Grab came in on time to fuel the gig economy. It grew rapidly in Singapore since 2013 and brought disruptions to the traditional taxi industry. But if one takes on tasks from these companies, it must be with a cautionary \"employees beware\" mindset. Not new, this challenge has plagued freelancers for a long time. Inevitably, there will be times where one is without a task that provides income – or in the case of Grab, a ride, drivers’ incentives or other benefits. If income is not an issue, one can enjoy leisure. And if workers take on gig jobs as a supplement to a steady stream of income, or such platforms help those out of a job to earn some money, companies like Grab are to be welcomed. But if it’s full-time employment workers seek, they must know that they are at the whims and fancies of the companies they work with. Since Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s regional operations in March, Grab drivers’ earning have been hit hard. For instance, one grab driver claim that his earnings had fallen by 30 per cent.  HARD TO FIND A JOB Many Grab drivers have tried leaving gig driving but they have difficulties finding another job, because many mistook it for long-term employment and have seen their other skills eroded, which makes finding another job with a decent wage very difficult. Being a Grab driver also does not give you much time to learn new skills. After driving for 10 hours a day for six days a week, you will be too exhausted to attend classes, let alone absorb what is taught. Amidst this bleak outlook, at least one firm has risen to break the mold. A new taxi company, HDT Singapore Taxi, has offered fixed salaries and employment benefits such as annual leave and CPF contribution to its drivers. With a basic salary of S$1,900 monthly, if HDT drivers hit S$8,500 a month in revenue, their gross salary can rise to S$4,300 a month. Some taxi drivers said that it is not easy to hit $7,500 a month, yet they feel that they are better off as taxi drivers as they have better control of their times. But HDT Singapore’s model is nascent and small compared to the more than 40,000 private car drivers. Meanwhile, more help with retraining and job matching might oil the wheels for Grab drivers. NTUC is launching a wide-ranging study to find out how workers can be matched to future jobs, as digitalisation and disruption has changed the way businesses operate, labour chief Ng Chee Meng announced this week. To encourage drivers to invest in their retraining and give them skin in the game, perhaps we should encourage Singaporeans to put money in their SkillsFuture account by matching the amount on a one-to-one basis subject to a ceiling. WHITHER RETIREMENT? Even still, the growth of gig jobs is not likely to abate, where the number of gig workers including those who are self-employed numbers more than 220,000 now and is expected to increase. We can discuss how to help Grab drivers find full-time jobs, but it is also pertinent to focus on their retirement adequacy. Where CPF provides a huge part of retirement income in Singapore, these workers have no CPF contributions for the company they work for. How do you nudge them to save adequately for their old age if they fall outside the CPF scheme? One idea to improve the retirement adequacy of gig workers is to encourage them to contribute to the Special Account under the CPF scheme, which receives a higher interest rate compared to ordinary account and improve incentives that encourage this group to do so. This difference in rate and added incentives should be high enough to lure them to contribute to the CPF scheme but not high to induce full-time employees to switch to gig employment. TIME TO ASK OURSELVES HARD QUESTIONS The media spotlight on Grab drivers struggling to find a job has raised many questions about what can be done to aid them. This is an inevitable challenge of disruption and a digital economy where companies that must scale up rapidly will use short-term incentives to attract labour and the workforce must make its own informed decisions. But public policy on retraining and retirement adequacy must also reflect this new reality where a sizable proportion of workers will undertake gig work.

If the amendments are passed, both private-hire and taxi drivers will also no longer need to file tax claims separately for service fees paid to platform providers like Grab and Ryde. MOF said it received 100 suggestions, of which 37 were accepted and revisions made accordingly to the draft text of the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, which will be introduced in Parliament on Monday (Sep 10). The ministry said one common piece of feedback it received was for private-hire drivers to be allowed tax deductions on car-related expenses against their driving income. “For greater ease of compliance and simplicity, service fees will be included in the prescribed deemed expense ratio. Taxpayers can use the prescribed ratio to proxy all their deductible expenses, without having to claim tax deduction for service fees paid to platform providers separately,\" it said. Some also asked for the prescribed \"deemed expense ratio\" to be simplified and increased - from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. Under the proposed amendments, the expense ratio will be increased to 60 per cent for both private-hire and taxi drivers. The ministry said it consulted both the National Taxi Association and the National Private Hire Vehicle Association on the common expenses incurred by drivers before it decided to adjust the expense ratio. GREATER POWERS FOR IRAS TO INVESTIGATE TAX CRIMES Under the draft Bill, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will be granted greater powers to investigate tax crimes, although such powers will be limited to prevent potential abuse. Among the feedback MOF has rejected is one suggesting that a taxpayer be notified once IRAS has passed on his information to law enforcement agencies. “The proposed amendment is intended to allow IRAS to share with law enforcement agencies information that IRAS assesses as necessary for investigation or prosecution of serious crimes only. Such serious crimes include drug dealing and corruption. “Notifying the taxpayer of the information shared or how information may be shared will alert potential suspects on ongoing investigations into serious crimes, thereby prejudicing the investigations,” MOF said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/phv-grab-drivers-tax-deduction-10700218"}, {"datetime": "10 Sep 2018 12:01AM", "tags": ["Singapore Police Force", "CID"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "Singapore’s 1st female CID chief: ‘There is no glass ceiling in the police’", "content": " SINGAPORE: One and only one case in Florence Chua’s near-three decade police career fills her with regret - and it happened in her second year on the job. “It was a rape of a five-year-old girl by two perpetrators whom the mother had handed the girl over to, to help look after,” Ms Chua, now 52, recalled. “Before we could complete the prosecution, the mother - who was not local - decided to bring the girl back home and in the end, the two chaps weren’t convicted. “I still think, could I have done it better?” Today, as Singapore’s first-ever female chief of the premier Criminal Investigation Department (CID), it is episodes like these which continue to remind her why she does what she does. “It keeps me going every day … the satisfaction of bringing closure to families; victims and keeping perpetrators off the street,” said Ms Chua, who is also the first female deputy commissioner - second in rank only to the police commissioner himself. “It’s like when you read about cases and think, this ‘fellow needs to be taken out’. Those are the moments.” Yet she very nearly did not become a policewoman at all: In her early 20s, while still captain of Singapore’s national hockey team, she thought of working as a physical education teacher. Her dream job was “something not desk-bound, something to challenge me on a daily basis and something I could make a difference in”; she eventually applied to join the police in 1989. Ms Chua’s journey has since traversed the investigation and intelligence departments to anti-vice and secret society branches to a stint with the home affairs ministry where she helped set up the Casino Regulatory Authority. She also kept her place in the national hockey squad for 10 more years, lining up alongside luminaries like Melanie Martens to famously strike gold at the 1993 Southeast Asian Games held on home soil. The sport, she said, imbued in her a long-lasting foundation of discipline, teamwork, resilience (think committing to training sessions after 24 hour work-days) as well as a mind constantly plotting different strategies and tactics to outwit opponents. An example of the latter? “I was in a back lane full of transvestites when somebody shouted ‘police’ and the fellow next to me wanted to run,” said Ms Chua. “He fell right in front of me - because I was stepping on his sari.” “GENDER SHOULD NOT MATTER” When the dreaded yet inevitable gender questions were directed at her, Ms Chua - the eldest of four sisters - acquitted herself comfortably. “You know people keep saying ‘first female’ this, ‘first female’ that … but I’m not the first in a lot of areas. For example, I was not the first female commander. And I wasn’t the first female in the SSB (secret society branch). “Before me, we already had females who’d been breaking the glass ceiling.” Cancel that - when it comes to Singapore’s police force, “there’s really no glass ceiling”, Ms Chua declared. “Yes, when I first joined, there weren’t many female officers in investigation. But now you see female officers in almost every job and post, even leading our Emergency Response Teams to respond to terrorist incidents. In the early days, you won’t imagine this being done but today this is quite common.” Pressed to share her everyday experiences, she said: “I don’t think there are a lot of obstacles to being a female officer. It’s easier for us to be a bit more empathetic ... certain situations and crimes, we will be able to handle more sensitively. “But in terms of expectations, requirements … it’s all the same. All of us do IPPT (Individual Physical Proficiency Test); shooting; when we go through courses we are expected to do the same thing; if a ladder is in front all of us are expected to climb it.” The only plausible difference lies in IPPT scoring standards, Ms Chua added. “Gender should not matter ... It’s not whether you are male or female, but whether you have the capability; ability to do the job,” she summed up. To reach her current post as CID director is to reach what Ms Chua herself described as the “apex” of a career in investigation; if not all the force. It is a testament to her ability - already borne out in a sprawling résumé of cases she either led or participated in. Highlights include the businessman kidnapped - and rescued - on the eve of his wedding in 2001; tracking down both dead and surviving Singaporeans after the 2004 tsunami; the 2013 cyber attacks initiated by the “Messiah” hacker; the Little India riots the same year; and the 2014 “Sheng Siong kidnapping”. “I’M NOT JUST SITTING BEHIND A DESK” Her track record of high-profile cases has been amplified in just the last three months, starting with a baptism of fire in the Trump-Kim summit announced on June 1 - the same day she assumed the CID leadership.  In July alone she dealt with the Serangoon slashing, SingHealth cyber attacks and illegal World Cup gambling; the next month the Boon Lay pawnshop robbery happened. Little wonder she described her biggest challenge so far as “trying to find enough time”. Not that Ms Chua is complaining: In a way, the job still ticks the criteria boxes she once had as an action-seeking young woman. “Director of CID doesn’t mean I don’t go on the ground, I still do. I’m able to still run operations, so I’m not just sitting behind a desk and looking at policies,” she laughed. She has even retained the structured rigour of a competitive athlete, by waking up at 6am five times a week to hit the gym before heading to work - something she hasn’t stopped looking forward to daily. Reflecting on her journey, Ms Chua said: “I’ve to sit down and count before I realise it’s been 29 years. Things moved pretty fast; time just passed … When I joined, I didn’t even think where I’d be when I retire. “There were times when things didn’t really go very well and I thought about leaving. But do you just pack up and leave, or stay on and deal with it and make it a better place for others?” she mused. “At the end of the day .. this is a job that I really like to do and it’s also a job that gives meaning. Every day I come in and I see officers willing to put in long hours, not complaining, and the only reason they do it? They want to see justice done.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-first-female-cid-chief-director-police-florence-chua-10698848"}, {"datetime": "09 Sep 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["penal code", "K Shanmugam"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "Marital rape, voyeurism to become offences in ‘sweeping’ changes proposed for Singapore’s penal code", "content": " SINGAPORE: The abolishment of marital immunity for rape and the introduction of voyeurism as an offence form part of what Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam described as “sweeping” changes to Singapore’s penal code proposed by a review committee in its 500-page report. A total of 169 recommendations were submitted to the Government at the end of August and will be open to public feedback from Monday (Sep 10) till the end of the month. A Penal Code Amendment Bill is targeted to be tabled in Parliament in November. The recommendations are spread over five main areas - the largest of which is dedicated to strengthening protection for the vulnerable in society. For instance, the committee has proposed creating new offences involving child abuse material - from using or involving a child in the production of, to the making, distributing, selling, advertising, seeking, accessing and possession of such material. This includes fictional material. The committee said fictional material could be used for grooming children, and could fuel child abuse by reinforcing potential abusers’ inappropriate feelings towards children.  It has also suggested enhanced penalties for committing a penal code offence against domestic helpers; children below 14; and vulnerable persons - defined as those unable to protect themselves by way of mental or physical disability. Those convicted could face up to two times the maximum punishment prescribed for such offences. Mr Shanmugam added: “With the Joshua Robinson-type cases, where young children are being exposed to unacceptable material, being sexually groomed, we want to deal very severely with that.” Robinson, an American mixed martial arts instructor, was in 2017 jailed four years for various offences including sex with minors, showing an obscene film to a six-year-old girl and possessing nearly 6,000 obscene films including child pornography. The committee has thus proposed that it shall be an offence to cause a minor to look at sexual images. It will also be an offence for anyone to cause or allow the death or serious injury of a child or vulnerable person. Offenders can be jailed for up to 20 years, fined and caned. Causing the death of a vulnerable person by sustained abuse will also be an offence. Explaining the latter, Mr Shanmugam said: “For example, a child gets badly treated over a period of six, eight weeks … starved, beaten, dunked in water and so on - and all of these have happened - the final act that caused the death would not by itself have killed a healthy child. “With the current state of the law, the prosecution has got to prove that with the final thing that made the child die, the person had intention to kill and that the act itself would have killed. That’s not easy.” “NO MEANS NO” A full, unqualified repeal of marital immunity for rape was another key proposal - “based on the principle that all women should be protected from sexual abuse, regardless of their marital status or the identity of the perpetrator”, said a joint press release by the ministries of home affairs and law. “The majority of our population no longer subscribe to the belief that a wife had irrevocably surrendered herself to sexual intercourse with her husband upon marriage,” the release added. Said Mr Shanmugam: “I’ve thought it odd that we still have immunity for husbands who rape their wives. A woman’s body is her own. And even if she’s your wife, she’s entitled to say no - and no means no.” Asked if this proposal could potentially come into conflict with Islamic beliefs, he said: “We have consulted Muslim scholars. Our understanding is it doesn’t contradict. “The Muslim community, in reactions we had in our consultations, has taken a similar approach in today’s Singapore - that the woman’s autonomy should be respected and all religions, including Islam, do not prohibit that. But it’s something we need to engage and explain much more.” ADAPTING TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT The committee also sought to tackle emerging crime trends brought about by technology as well as the proliferation of mobile devices and social media. It has recommended specific offences be created for the making, distributing, possessing and accessing of voyeuristic recordings regardless of gender. Distributing or threatening to distribute an intimate image, along with sexual exposure, are other new offences being suggested. In the area of white-collar crime, the committee recommended a new offence of fraud, adapted from the United Kingdom, to deal with emerging crime tactics that target financial systems. Given that technology and the Internet has enabled crime and criminals to cross borders, it has also recommended the clarification and expansion of extra-territorial jurisdiction for selected white-collar and property offences.  “We see increasingly sophisticated and complex criminal schemes which threaten the integrity of our financial systems and prey on vulnerable consumers,” the joint press release said.  Under the third category of updating the penal code, a key suggestion is the decriminalising of attempted suicide. “When a person is desperate enough to want to take his own life, putting him in jail doesn’t seem to be the most obvious thing to do,” said Mr Shanmugam. “I don’t think the deterrent effect will be softened because if you were intending to kill yourself, you’re not really going to worry whether you’re going to jail or not - you’ve already assumed you’re not going to be living anymore. “But abetting someone to commit suicide is still an offence. So people who can be deterred will continue to be deterred.” The committee has instead recommended amending the legislation to empower the police to intervene when responding to suicide attempts, as well as empowering medical practitioners and the courts to order detention at a psychiatric institution for treatment. Other areas of suggested amendments lie in the removal of outdated criminal laws and updating of the sentencing framework. Section 377A of the penal code, which criminalises acts of “gross indecency” between men, was not part of the review. A similar law was repealed by India earlier this week, prompting reactions in Singapore from Mr Shanmugam, diplomat Tommy Koh and others. The review committee was convened in mid-2016 and is made up of leading practitioners and thought leaders from the private sector, academia and the public sector, including the Attorney-General’s Chambers and the Judiciary. It is co-chaired by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health Amrin Amin. Thanking the committee for its efforts on behalf of the Government, Mr Shanmugam said: “The Committee has proposed wide-ranging changes to the Penal Code, which the Government will now discuss, with the benefit of views obtained from consultation sessions with various stakeholders. It is my hope that this process will culminate in a revised Penal Code that is principled, proportionate, and practical; one which will continue to serve Singapore well in the years to come.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/penal-code-review-marital-rape-voyeurism-suicide-vulnerable-10697396"}, {"datetime": "09 Sep 2018 04:05PM", "tags": ["Singapore Police Force"], "author": "", "title": "Full-time police national serviceman dies from gunshot wound to his head", "content": " SINGAPORE: A full-time police national serviceman died on Sunday (Sep 9), six days after he was found with a gunshot wound to his head at the Protective Security Command in Ulu Pandan.

Mr Shanmugam was speaking to reporters for the second time on the subject, since a landmark ruling by India’s Supreme Court on Thursday repealing a British colonial-era ban on gay sex. “In the Singapore context, the Section 377A was challenged as being unconstitutional some years ago, 2014. The Supreme Court decided that it was constitutional, it was not invalid. So whether you decide to keep it, whether you decide to repeal it, amend it, it’s a matter for parliament.” Mr Shanmugam added that depending on legislation, “public opinion is often relevant” when it comes to public policy making. Under section 377A, a man found to have committed an act of \"gross indecency\" with another man could be jailed for up to two years. On Friday, Mr Shanmugam said that while there is a growing minority who want 377A to be repealed, Singaporeans remain \"deeply split\" on the matter.  “Singapore ... on this issue, it is a deeply split society. The majority oppose to any change to section 377A - they are opposed to removing it. “A minority - I have to say, a growing minority - want it to be repealed. The Government is in the middle,” he added. His comments came after diplomat Tommy Koh, who is Ambassador-at-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had responded to the Indian ruling by encouraging Singapore's gay community to “try again” to challenge 377A. Previous legal challenges in 2014 had failed. Professor Koh made the comments in response to a Facebook post by a senior Singapore-based academic on India's landmark ruling on Thursday.

And they put (the dogs) inside cages,” said Maria (not her real name), the maid. This inspired Michael (not his real name) to start a home pet boarding business at the age of 16, while still in Secondary 4. He went online to list his services, after checking if his maid was willing to help out with the dog sitting. Hired by Michael’s parents as a foreign domestic worker, Maria instead spends a large portion of her time at the forefront of the canine boarding operations, while Michael handles the back end communications with clients. And this has been happening in the full knowledge and support of her employers. Today, she is frequently seen walking a changing assortment of dogs several times a day around her employer’s home in the north of Singapore. Overseeing up to four dogs a time at her home, she still has to tend to her household chores in addition to caring for the pooches. “I walk each dog twice a day, then I give them 15 minutes just to walk around by themselves. Every time I will pick up their poop,” she shared. “I help to take care when Michael goes to school, but I do everything – bathing the dog and all.” A dog lover herself, Maria lamented how painful it was to see the dogs come and go. While already finding joy in taking care of the canines that come by, she also receives a cut of the proceeds for her labour, despite being aware of the potential illegality of Michael’s entrepreneurial stint and her role in it. “I am happy. I have been in Singapore for 16 years already, and I have been with this family for 10 years. My employers here are quite good also – they are very nice to me, and never make me do this and that.” While she may be personally content with the additional non-domestic roles that were entrusted to her, the same may not be true for other maids in Singapore, who may be coerced into illegal deployment and employment in roles beyond their work permits’ job scope. A GROWING PROBLEM? The Internet has fuelled the growth of the burgeoning gig economy – from home-based businesses like baking to e-commerce shops run by ‘mumpreneurs’ (a term for mothers-turned-entrepreneurs), as more choose to earn an income while staying at home. The HDB’s Home-Based Small Scale Business Scheme allows households to conduct a limited range of commercial activities as long as they do not create problems and inconveniences for the neighbourhood. Maids employed in these households can be easily tapped on to render assistance in the commercial activities. “This is a problem. The difference between time at work and time at home is being eroded for a lot of people,” said John Gee, former president of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), a non-profit organisation which promotes equitable treatment for migrant workers in Singapore. “Even without intentionally taking advantage of a domestic worker, they may slip into a habit of giving her additional work outside the job she was hired to do,” he cautioned. Renewed attention has been thrown on this issue after a recent report of an employer being fined for allowing two maids to build and ascend scaffolds and conduct painting works at the exterior of her two-storey bungalow. A first to be convicted for breaching work permit conditions involving the safety of maids since the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was amended with stiffer penalties in 2012, the domestic workers were deemed to be illegally employed as a scaffolder and maintenance worker. They were also working in an unsafe environment without proper safety training and gear. Under the act, an employer can be liable to a fine of up to $30,000 or a prison sentence for up to 12 months, or both, for illegal employment. In Maria’s case, she could be considered as being illegally employed as a pet caretaker.  In addition, it is also forbidden for HDB and private households to engage in pet boarding activities, as special licences have to be obtained from the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). SCOPE FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY? While there is no data tracking this phenomenon, experts believe it is a widespread habit.  After all, one in five households in Singapore employs a foreign domestic worker, with numbers seeing steady increases in recent years.  In 2017 alone, 246,700 maids were hired, according to the latest numbers from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). “I think that most employers are well aware that they should not get their domestic workers to go to work elsewhere or to undertake work that goes beyond their domestic role – notably, by doing work for an employer's business,” said Gee. For instance, at a home-based business which deals with the sale of sundries at a landed property estate, a maid was seen helping with the receiving and packing of goods at the driveway when Channel NewsAsia visited recently. “She helps us a little, especially when we are not at home. I don’t see why it’s a problem if everyone is happy,” said the business owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While he is aware of the potential legal tussle that could arise, the employer insisted that her welfare is well taken care of and that she is not made to move heavy objects. “There should be some flexibility in the rules. It is helpful in our business to have an extra hand when we are in a pinch,” he added. “We also help her with the housework – it goes both ways.” SOLVING THE PROBLEM  Placing domestic workers under the coverage of the Employment Act is one way to solve the problem, suggested Gee. “That would give them regular hours: A standard 44 hours, with a maximum of 72 hours overtime a month. And once that framework existed as a protection against exploitation, there would be scope for looking at what flexibility might be allowed within the permitted time frame.” But allowing maids to work in non-domestic roles could present new complications for lawmakers, as it might create a problem of overworking maids and increase competition in the job market for Singaporeans, he said. “These cases seem to argue for more flexibility in the regulations. But law and regulations have to set a base line somewhere.” Part of the issue is that what constitutes domestic and non-domestic work is not clearly defined in legislation, and this can lead to inconsistent enforcement, said Stephanie Chok, Advocacy & Communications Manager for the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME). Authorities should also ensure there is consistent and adequate enforcement, as well as access to remedial justice for domestic workers. “HOME regularly sees domestic workers at our shelter who are asked to undertake tasks which fall outside of what one would reasonably assume to constitute domestic work, or to engage in unsafe work,” she added. For instance, over at Tampines, a private tutor who conducts small-group tuition at her home told Channel NewsAsia that she gets the help of her maid to prepare the tables and serve water to her students. Well-aware that maids are not supposed to help out in home businesses, she feels that drawing the line between some of these activities is “a grey area\". “My students are no different from guests who visit my home. In fact, my maid always takes the initiative to help my students feel comfortable at my place,” Mdm Tan said. Her maid, who asked not to be named, said: “It’s not difficult. Madam is nice to me. I want everyone to be happy. Some of my friends have to clean a big bungalow, but I just have to clean one flat. I am quite lucky already.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/moving-your-maid-from-domestic-chores-to-helping-your-business-a-10671102"}, {"datetime": "09 Sep 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["NRIC", "cybersecurity"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Online NRIC generators a 'cause for concern', cybersecurity experts say", "content": " SINGAPORE: While the Government has issued new guidelines against indiscriminate collection of NRIC details, cybersecurity experts have highlighted a different kind of personal data threat: random NRIC generators.   From September 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) said organisations can only collect, use or disclose NRIC numbers or NRIC copies \"under certain specific circumstances\". But a quick online search by Channel NewsAsia turned up at least two random NRIC generators that can produce \"valid\" NRIC numbers that are \"verified against published checking logic\". Both only required a user to input the desired NRIC number's first letter and corresponding range of birth years before churning out the digits. When announcing the new NRIC guidelines in August, the PDPC had said that the NRIC number is a \"permanent and irreplaceable identifier which can be used to unlock large amounts of information relating to an individual\". “In today’s digital economy, indiscriminate collection or negligent handling of NRIC numbers can increase the risk of unintended disclosure and may result in NRIC numbers being used for illegal activities such as identity theft or fraud,\" it added. Mr Jonathan Phua, who co-founded cybersecurity firm InsiderSecurity, said the online NRIC generators pose \"big cyber risks\" as many online services use NRIC numbers as usernames. \"We know that many people like to use simple-to-remember passwords,\" he told Channel NewsAsia. \"So if I generated a list of random, valid-looking NRIC numbers, I can try my luck to access such services with these NRIC numbers and commonly used passwords. \"Hopefully, the online services have measures in place to make this kind of attack more difficult, but the attacker may get lucky with an online service that is not so well-protected.\" Ms Joanne Wong, senior regional director for Asia-Pacific and Japan at LogRhythm, a security intelligence firm, said the generators can be a \"cause for concern\". \"A system using artificial intelligence can be fed a list of existing NRIC numbers, possibly stolen in a data breach or bought on the dark web, and taught how to better identify and predict valid NRIC numbers,\" she said. \"Further cross referencing between different sets of stolen data may reveal information such as favourite passwords and mobile numbers tagged to an individual NRIC number. \"In the worst-case scenario, this might even lead to accounts using NRIC numbers as part of login details to be compromised.\" Mr Clement Lee, principal consulting security architect for Asia, Middle East and Africa at Check Point Software Technologies, said hackers can build \"context\" around the generated NRIC numbers to launch an effective social engineering campaign. For example, a hacker who is able to match the NRIC number to a person's full name and mobile number can call the victim while posing as a person in authority. \"Step by step, the victim will be guided to install further mobile malware for further personal data phishing,\" Mr Lee said, adding that advanced hackers can substitute their personal numbers with official-looking ones. SHOULD YOU BE WORRIED? While it is clear that online NRIC generators can be used for nefarious activities, the experts said there are measures in place to ensure criminals have a tough time. For example, organisations would usually need additional information like proof of address for verification, said Mr Dexter Ng, chief technology officer at AntiHack.me, a bug bounty platform. \"As there are ways of validating these numbers, it would be difficult to use these generated numbers for illegal activities,\" Ms Wong said. Likewise, Mr Lee said it is \"extremely tedious to build the context around the NRIC numbers for them to be really useful\", while Mr Phua said the NRIC generators \"don't pose a new risk\" as they have been around for a long time. Mr Ng said the public \"should not worry too much\" about the generators, but instead \"be more aware and concerned about data breaches from companies that store their data or companies that sell their data for money\". PURPOSE OF NRIC GENERATORS So, what then is an online NRIC generator used for? Ms Wong said they can be used for contests, giveaways and registrations, pointing out that the generated NRICs might not necessarily belong to a real person. \"The most common usage or abuse for generators are registration of multiple accounts to gain referral points or discounts,\" Mr Ng said. As for the creators themselves, one stated on the generator's website that it is used for software testing purposes, while another said it \"serves to demonstrate that it is possible to do so\". Mr Phua said the NRIC algorithm is simple enough that coders can take as quickly as 20 minutes to write their own random generator. \"The NRIC algorithm was never meant to be an impenetrable cipher, but a check for input errors,\" Mr Lee said. \"With a large enough data set, any budding cryptanalyst would be able to solve this algorithm.\" SHOULD AUTHORITIES STEP IN? Despite the generator's simplicity, its creators are quick to acknowledge the harm it can potentially cause. \"You should not use the NRIC numbers to impersonate anyone as it is an offence,\" one said on the generator's website. Another added: \"Users are not allowed to use NRIC/FIN generated for work usage, or submit into Government systems.\" It remains unclear if it is legal to generate random yet valid NRIC numbers. Queries to the Info-communications Media Development Authority were referred to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), which issues identity cards to Singapore citizens. Channel NewsAsia has reached out to ICA for comment. Nevertheless, the experts are clear about the importance of protecting the unique and widely-used NRIC numbers. \"If an organisation's system is compromised, the perpetrator might make use of the NRIC number to search for more privileged information about the person,\" said Mr Wayne Lee, a junior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab APAC's global research and analysis team. Furthermore, Mr Phua said attackers can use NRICs to tie together different kinds of leaked data from various sources and build a profile for different individuals. \"This will be useful to the attacker for identify theft, fraud or even state-sponsored espionage,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/online-nric-generators-cause-for-concern-cybersecurity-experts-10693588"}, {"datetime": "09 Sep 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["HDB", "VERS", "SERS", "housing", "en bloc"], "author": "Sing Tien Foo", "title": "Commentary: What a ‘Housing Redevelopment Board’ will do for mature estates", "content": " SINGAPORE: “We will continue to transform our city … and in 30 to 40 years’ time, we will rebuild our existing towns,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at this year’s National Day Rally (NDR). “HDB will be very busy. They may have to change their name to HRB – the Housing Redevelopment Board,” he quipped. PM Lee also announced the expansion of the Home Improvement Programme (HIP II) and a new Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) at the same event, measures that may provide some respite to confused HDB home dwellers concerned with the growing uncertainty of the value of their 99-year leases. VERS A KEY LEVER VERS will be a key lever for an imagined, future Housing Redevelopment Board, but it has been carefully designed to factor in a community’s collective choice on housing as flats age. VERS takes on a very similar approach as the en bloc scheme for private properties, except public housing flats in selected precincts will only be returned back to the Government if residents vote “yes” to the scheme.  The compensation from the VERS will allow residents to pay for another flat or keep the money for their retirement needs. However, residents who wish to continue to live in their flats until their leases expire could vote “no”. As this scheme is still a work-in-progress, details of the selection criteria of precincts, majority voting rules, compensation, and many more have yet to be ironed out. Will VERS stick to the minimum of 80 per cent consent needed to proceed, just like in the private en-bloc scheme, or will the bar be higher? How high is high enough? Should flats be taken back by the Government in VERS, will home dwellers be given replacement flats in nearby estates as is the case in the current selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (SERS)? VERS is part of the Government’s long-term plan to redevelop some of the oldest HDB housing estates, including Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh that were built in a “rush” during the peak of the housing construction programme from the 1960s to the 1980s.  When clusters of flats in these HDB estates reach 70 years simultaneously, some of the flats will be taken back through VERS, while other flats, where VERS was rejected, could be upgraded through HIP II. Regardless of the decision made by each precinct, we may expect many to say yes. What this means on a national level is that VERS will enable the Government to phase and pace out estate redevelopment in a more systematic and planned manner, avoiding the same costly construction rush in Singapore’s early years. SERS AN EXPENSIVE AND RARELY APPLIED LEVER But there’s also the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). While, unlike VERS, it remains highly selective and applicable to only a small percentage of HDB flats in Singapore, SERS is a harder urban redevelopment tool that allows the Government to acquire the land on which aged flats sit on without requiring residents to vote. But the high costs, which includes ensuring residents have a replacement flat in the vicinity to move to, suggest this tool will remain limited to high-potential precincts in mature HDB estates. Indeed, the compensation for SERS is very generous and assistance to move to another house is extensive. When the Government identifies a precinct to carry out SERS, home owners will be notified early and compensated based on the market value of their flats at the time of the SERS announcement. Home owners can use the proceeds to take up a new 99-year lease flat at a designated replacement site, apply for a flat from a HDB sale launch, or sell or transfer their flat with rehousing benefits. If they choose not to take up SERS rehousing benefits, they would receive up to S$30,000 as an ex-gratia payments on top of their SERS compensation. Still, home owners should not assume all HDB flats entering the final stages of their leases are eligible for this SERS scheme. While there are still opportunities for SERS to take place in the coming years, projects with the highest redevelopment potential have already carried out SERS and selected flats make up only 4 per cent of the HDB stock. LESSONS FROM THE PRIVATE MARKET EN BLOC SALES  Perhaps an imagined Housing Redevelopment Board can design details of the newly-announced VERS scheme by drawing some lessons from the en bloc sales in the private housing market. In the same vein as what VERS intends to do in the public housing market, en bloc sales ensure that Singapore’s private housing scene remains dynamic and keeps abreast with Singapore’s urban renewal plans - by allowing owners of either strata units in private non-landed residential developments or houses on contiguous land plots to come together to jointly sell redevelopment rights of their land to private developers. En bloc deals can be a lucrative affair for home owners in land-scarce Singapore, if their existing land have not reaped their “highest and best use” potential. But what tempers profit-driven property developers, who may fork out large sums of money to entice home owners into agreeing to an en bloc sale scheme, is the profit motive. They will do their sums to ensure they can still profit from future redevelopment of the en bloc site. On the flipside, VERS is a Government-initiated project that utilises public funds to carry out a buyback scheme. Therefore, the compensation the Government forks out for home owners has to be prudent. Policymakers are also mindful that overly generous compensations could risk sparking a demand frenzy in the public housing market, which may raise prices for the new flats built on sites that have undergone VERS, and go against their goal of providing affordable housing for Singaporeans. REJUVENATION OF A NATION'S HOUSING VERS, SERS and en bloc all involve efforts that rejuvenate neighbourhoods in Singapore. The sum of their effects is to renew Singapore’s housing stock and upgrade residential properties to match home owners’ changing needs. All three schemes aim at preserving home owners’ housing wealth, by unlocking and partially distributing value from a better use of land back to home owners. It is inevitable that the newly-announced VERS may attract some over-zealous buyers to speculate on HDB flats they think may potentially fall under VERS  in the coming years. But such unhealthy, rent-seeking behaviour could crowd out other home buyers who want to live out their lives in those neighbourhoods. Buyers may reap some monetary benefits, if they together with the majority of other residents vote for the VERS when selected. But because the compensation is unlikely to be as much as those under SERS, buyers should heed caution and avoid relying on VERS to be bailed out. Much work lies ahead for the authorities in ensuring that Singapore’s housing markets remains affordable and sustainable in the long run, not just in regulating unhealthy speculation in the property market but in the less eyeball-grabbing role of renewing the housing stock for future home owners. What the Government has done at the National Day Rally is to chart out a path and give themselves leeway to plan for and redevelop new housing estates in Singapore, in anticipation that some public housing leases will run out at the same time and home owners will need time to think about whether to say yes to VERS. An imagined Housing Redevelopment Board may have more schemes to provide more options for home owners to monetise their old flats but this is a heartening start. Meanwhile, any new, suitable policy that preserves the housing wealth for HDB owners, who make up more than 80 per cent of the general public, will certainly attract the media spotlight and be closely scrutinised.

His fever persisted into the next evening, so mother Mazlin Khairudin took him to a doctor, who told her it was “a normal fever with a little rash on his throat”, recalled the Penang resident. “That’s all.” Two days later, her boy’s condition deteriorated, and she rushed him to a hospital, where he died from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a common viral illness. Toddler Yusuf Danial had become the first Malaysian victim of the Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) HFMD strain – a more virulent strain that is also on the increase in Singapore. “His lungs were filled with virus,” Mdm Mazlin told the programme Talking Point. “The doctor said he’d try his best to treat Danial. He gave antibiotics, but Danial’s body rejected them. Around 8.48pm, his heart stopped beating.” (Watch the episode here.) In Malaysia, HFMD has soared to near epidemic levels this year – over 55,000 cases as of Aug 27 – with the outbreak in Penang rising to more than 3,700 cases. Of these, the EV-71 strain has claimed the lives of two: Danial, in June, and a 27-month-old child in Sarawak, in July. In Singapore, more than 31,000 HFMD cases have been reported to date. This is what you need to know about the EV-71 strain in particular. 1. HOW CAN YOU TELL IT’S EV-71? Some of the symptoms of this strain are vomiting, irritability, seizures and breathing difficulties, said KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital senior consultant (Infectious Diseases) Chong Chia Yin. “The other thing you can look out for is lethargy. (If) the child refuses to eat and drink, then you also have to come in (to hospital). If the urine output is already reduced, you’d have to come in (too) because the child is showing signs of dehydration,” she explained. “If your child has a lot of bubbles and blisters on the hands and feet, it’s less likely to be EV-71.” In Danial’s case, he experienced flu symptoms, breathing difficulties and mouth ulcers. He died three days after receiving treatment in hospital, and Mdm Mazlin regrets not getting him admitted earlier. “Parents, please pay attention to your child. If there’s something different about your child, and the fever doesn’t seem to go down in one or two days, better send your child for a blood test or X-ray straightaway because this virus is everywhere,” she beseeched. 2. HOW IS EV-71 MORE VIRULENT? HFMD is usually mild, with few complications, but the EV-71 strain can be fatal because of its severe complications, which include neurological, respiratory and cardiovascular problems. It is also more infectious than the Coxsackie virus, the most common cause of HFMD. Associate Professor Chong said a child with a Group A Coxsackie virus, for example, would usually spread it to 2.4 other children. But a child with EV-71 would usually spread it to 3.5 other children. 3. IS IT SAFE TO VISIT PENANG? By mid-July, the number of HFMD cases this year was twice the number in the same period last year – an outbreak Penang Health Committee chairman Afif Bahardin described then as “beyond the danger level”. But there is “a tremendous decline now”. The state’s Health Department had, in July, directed shopping malls to sanitise their trolleys, child rides and public benches. At one hawker centre popular with tourists, nightly cleaning sessions are still going on. “(For) those who are visiting Penang, what’s important is to keep a self-awareness of cleanliness,” said Dr Afif. He acknowledged, however, the emergence of the more virulent EV-71 “at a bigger number compared to the usual pattern we’ve seen for the past few years”, when the Coxsackie virus was more widespread. 4. WHAT ABOUT EV-71 IN SINGAPORE? While the Ministry of Health has reported a “slight increase” in the proportion of EV-71 cases here, the Coxsackie virus type A remains the predominant strain, like in past years. The total number of HFMD cases – at 31,015 so far – is a 28 per cent increase from the same period last year. The last peak was in 2016, when reported cases hit 42,000 for the whole year. 5. HOW TO KEEP HFMD AT BAY? Wash your hands frequently, before and after meals and also after using the toilet. When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth or nose, advised Assoc Prof Chong. “Try not to share food and drinks. Don’t share personal items as well, for example your toothbrushes and towels. And if the child is infected, avoid kissing and hugging the child,” she said. While wet wipes may be suitable for cleaning the surfaces of doorknob or tables, a hand sanitiser is still needed, she added. 6. IS THERE ANY VACCINE AVAILABLE? There is no approved antiviral drug or vaccine in Singapore, but Associate Professor Justin Chu from the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine is working on a vaccine that may be viable in five years’ time. He is also leading a team of researchers who have developed an HFMD test kit that could soon allow children to be tested at home or their childcare centre – with just their saliva. This kit takes as quickly as about two hours to turn around the results, and can be used before symptoms of the virus appear. It is estimated that each kit will cost about S$2, but there is two or three years to go before it hits the market. 7. CAN PARENTS CATCH HFMD TOO? Yes. Ms Glynisia Yeo’s four-year-old son has caught HFMD thrice over a span of two years, and she was badly hit in 2016 when she contracted the disease from him. She could not eat for a few days because of the mouth ulcers; she could not walk properly because of the sores on her feet; she had painful rashes on her hands, and her skin started to peel. After she was discharged from hospital, she thought the worst was over. A few weeks later, the base of one of her fingernails “started peeling off”. Over the next few weeks, her fingernails and toenails fell off, and she suffered from hair loss too. “I did a check with my doctor, and he said (those) could be some of the after-effects because the virus that I was hit with was pretty severe,” said the 42-year-old, who has since recovered. “To me, (HFMD) is quite scary now. So I’m very worried, and sincerely hope that my son won’t catch it again.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

But on closer inspection, you will find that he took a year's break at the age of 24 and there have been some gaps between jobs. This was due to Mr Tan’s condition. He has bipolar disorder - a mental condition characterised by extreme highs and lows in mood. Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after a car accident, his emotions took a turn for the worse, culminating in fits of rage and hallucinations. It was then, in 2002, that he was diagnosed as bipolar.  After that, he was reluctant to declare his condition in job applications. “Once you declare, you may not even get an interview,” he told Channel NewsAsia.  While that had been a hunch, proof that it was true came earlier this year. During an eight-month break, and looking to switch careers, he asked a consultant at a recruitment agency: What if the potential candidate has mental health issues? The answer he received was: “Better not, lah. We don’t know when the person will snap. And I don’t think the company will know how to handle this group.” But withholding the truth at work comes with its own challenges, he said. “There’s always this insecurity. When colleagues’ behaviour towards me suddenly changes, I will wonder whether they found out from somewhere that I have bipolar. I will also think about what the consequences would be if my employer found out,” Mr Tan said. He is now one month into his job at Club Heal, a voluntary welfare organisation that helps people with mental illnesses and their families. CAMPAIGN TO GET RID OF THE STIGMA Mr Tan could be better off than others who have a mental condition struggling to find a job. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) on Saturday (Sep 8) revealed findings of a study showing that five in 10 respondents believe that those with mental conditions should not be given any responsibility.  NCSS hopes to change this perception through the first nationwide anti-stigma campaign. The Beyond the Label campaign launched on Saturday is a five-year public education effort funded by the Tote Board's Mental Health Strategic initiative. NCSS deputy chief executive Tina Hung, deputy chief executive at NCSS, said research shows that perceptions and attitudes are the most critical in changing the behaviour of individuals. “Hence, it’s crucial for us to change perceptions and attitudes towards persons with mental health conditions, to support inclusion and a better quality of life for all. With support and acceptance, persons in recovery can integrate into society and thrive,” she said.  TACKLING MISCONCEPTIONS Employers need to understand that mental illness is a disease and, like other illnesses, it is manageable with medication, therapy, self-help and societal support and understanding of the affliction, a spokesperson for the Singapore Association for Mental Health said. Ms Li Zhong Ying, principal occupational therapist at the Institute of Mental Health’s (IMH) Job Club, said very often supervisors and managers on the ground do not know how to better support employees with mental health conditions, or are unsure about the community support and services that are available. “I’ve heard some of them say that they might as well set up a charity if they are going to employ people from this group. Others are afraid of being held responsible. They think the staff will have outbursts, and that there will be complaints,” said Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health advocacy organisation Silver Ribbon. It has been reaching out to firms to provide them with the information they need on hiring people with mental health issues. REMOVING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION However, the need to declare one’s mental health history when applying for a job remains a bugbear among advocates. Ms Li from IMH’s Job Club said it encourages discrimination. “The job market is already very competitive, and to state it on a job application form will only further lower the chances of persons with mental health conditions securing a job, given the negative assumptions held by the public towards people with mental health conditions,” she said. She stressed that people with mental health conditions deserve a chance to prove that they can work productively. “Many such individuals are not only able to function as well as others in the workplace, but also often have qualifications, skills, abilities and experiences as required by the jobs,” she said. A perception shift is critical when it comes to the declaration of mental illness in a job application process, the Singapore Association for Mental Health said. “With greater awareness and understanding of mental health conditions, the declaration of one’s mental health conditions should be considered with respect and empathy as this is an act of strength and courage,” its spokesperson said. Even for those willing to hire, Ms Li cautioned against treating this group differently. “Employers should accord them the same pay rates and benefits as other workers. Employers should not have a mindset of doing 'charity work' and pay people with mental health conditions less or view them as beneficiaries,” she said. Still, the organisations acknowledged that more employers are now open to hiring those with a history of mental health issues. Between 2015 and 2017, Job Club has been in touch with 45 new companies who expressed interest in hiring its clients, Ms Li said. The Singapore Association for Mental Health's MINDSET Learning Hub, the first vocational training centre for those with mental health issues has placed 123 individuals in jobs between July 2016 and July this year. “To encourage a more inclusive workforce, incentives could be given to employers to encourage them to employ persons with mental health conditions, as well as to reward organisations that have already been doing so,” Ms Li said. LEADING BY EXAMPLE Eyewear shop Nanyang Optical has pledged to hire people with mental illnesses. So far, the firm, which has about 100 employees, has hired three people with schizophrenia and depression, said managing director Bernard Yang. “We made a slight adjustment to the job scope and environment so that it is easier for them to adapt. In addition, we also try to be more generous in giving words of encouragement to them,” he said, adding that a lot of understanding and cooperation is required across departments and colleagues. Mr Yang encouraged other companies to hire people with mental illnesses, and stressed the need for inclusion, as “everyone deserves a chance”. “Actually, they are not any different from any of us. If we can adapt to the different kinds of people at a workplace, we can definitely work with people with mental illness. All they need is a little encouragement and a little kindness, and also an opportunity,” he said. Although it may entail making changes to workflow, he said he believes it means a lot to them. There is also satisfaction, he said. “We feel good and happy when we see them improving along with the job, their condition becomes stable, and they smile more often,” he said. Mr Tan hopes that more employers will be accepting, hire people with mental health issues and see them for who they are. \"I don't want to be Eugene Tan with bipolar. I want to be just Eugene Tan.\"  Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story reported that the survey found that six in 10 people believe employees with mental conditions are less reliable.

We went back to school to find out", "content": " SINGAPORE: The feeling of alienation first hit when the students seated around me stood up in unison, pushing their chairs backwards with a screech. “Lao shi zao an,” the students chanted, bidding their teacher good morning in a greeting that sounded the same to me as it did when I was at school. Awkwardly, I followed suit, feeling more like a fish out of water with every moment. It was the first day of my attachment at Tanjong Katong Secondary, where I would be spending three days as a student to brush up on my abysmal Mandarin. And hearing the familiar greeting brought back several unfortunate memories of my time as a student – memories that I imagined had long been expunged. There was the dreaded ting xie or dictation, a weekly test of vocabulary that I would often end up failing spectacularly, despite my best efforts to memorise and practise writing the words. And the endless pages of cheng yu, or Chinese idioms, that I had to memorise and somehow reproduce in the exams. Needless to say, the only cheng yu that appeared in my exams was feng he ri li: The same phrase that everyone used in their exams. And there was also the non-negotiable ban on speaking English in class – a ban that earned me death stares from many a teacher as I struggled to express myself in Mandarin. I shed real tears over the subject when I was a student, not least because of the hours I spent on rote learning with nothing to show for my efforts. And once I attained the bare minimum grade to make it to university, I gleefully chucked my Chinese textbook aside and swore to myself never to bother picking the language up again. But here I was back in school, surrounded by classmates less than half my age and doing exactly what I had told myself I would never do. THEN AND NOW It all began with a conversation over a networking lunch with Ministry of Education staff, where I was intrigued to find out that the teaching and learning of the Chinese Language in schools has evolved over the years. Rather than the rote learning and memory work that had formed such an integral part of my personal experience, the focus of lessons nowadays has shifted: Emphasis is now placed on encouraging students to love the language, and use it in their daily life. Given my past experience with the subject, I was doubtful. How could students – particularly those like me who speak only English at home – be encouraged to love the language? I had to see this in action for myself, and what better way to do so than to embed myself in a Chinese Language class as a student?  As a working adult – and a journalist to boot – going back to school just for three days, I was aware that there were limits to how authentic my experience would be. But I was assured by my teacher, Mrs Lee-Sem Seow Wei, that she would make it as real as possible and that I would be treated the same as any student. Not only would I need to fully participate in each class activity, I would also have to complete every class assignment and take every test that the students would go through over the three days of my attachment. It sounded like a great opportunity. But when I realised I was to be joining a Higher Chinese class in the school, I began to wonder if I had bitten off more than I could chew.  I questioned why the school had chosen to place me in a class of that standard, given that I could barely write my name in Mandarin, much less read the textbook. But Mrs Lee was strangely sanguine when I voiced my apprehension about my survival prospects. “Don’t worry,” she said with a smile. “Just come for the lesson first.” “And don’t worry about preparing for class,” she added, anticipating my next question. “Just come, and enjoy it. The students will help you along if you don’t understand.” But despite her reassurances, my anxiety remained and reached a peak as I sat in the classroom watching my fellow pupils file in a sea of green and white uniforms. Some averted their eyes and scurried to their seats, while others looked curiously at me. Perhaps it was first day jitters, but my fear of being shunned by the students returned with a vengeance. However, they were soon put to rest when I was greeted with a friendly smile by my seatmate, Mandy Chan. “Are you all right? You look very nervous,” she said as she introduced herself and sank into her seat. THE FIRST TEST  The week’s topic was dreams and aspirations, and Mrs Lee started the lesson by reading out some stories in a textbook about famous people in history, such as Shakespeare and Bruce Lee. As I tried to follow along with the words in the textbook, she slowed down and used English terms to explain some of the more complex terms. Apart from my surprise at her use of English in class, I was also surprised to find out that speaking in class was also encouraged, so students could get instant help from each other when they had difficulty understanding some of the terms she was using, or practise using the language. She proceeded to tell the class a little more about Shakespeare’s life, and about some of his more well-known plays. I shook my head in amazement: Shakespeare was difficult enough to understand even as a university undergraduate. And here she was explaining the plot of Romeo and Juliet to the students, in Mandarin no less. But I was encouraged that I could follow more of the lesson than I thought I would, and that what I could understand was interesting and engaging. The laughter in class as Mrs Lee bantered with students in Mandarin also made it clear that the Chinese Language classroom was - for these students at least - not the nightmarish place I remembered it to be.  Apart from a few hiccups here and there, I was getting along swimmingly. But the real test was just around the corner. As we approached the tail end of the lesson, Mrs Lee distributed a set of newspaper articles, each one featuring a person who has overcome obstacles and gone on to achieve something great in their fields. We were then divided into groups, assigned one article each and given five minutes to read it and answer a series of questions in our group. As I flicked through the set of articles, looking at the walls of text I could not decipher, my eyes glazed over. I scanned the accompanying pictures hoping to get a clue, but apart from Olympic gold medalist Joseph Schooling, I had no idea who the rest of the people were. Okay, I thought to myself. I passed Chinese Language at the national exams, got my university degree and am now gainfully employed. If I put my mind to it, I can do this. Unfortunately, I couldn’t. My assigned article appeared to be about a group of students in China who had gained YouTube fame with their singing. But that was all I could gather based on the little that I could understand. Watch: The YouTube video we were shown in class  As I focused on slowly reading each word, I was distracted by Mrs Lee’s voice. “You should be done reading by now. Time to work on your questions!” I looked around me. Most of my classmates were already finishing the article. I was on the third line. I sighed, looking around for some backup, and my gaze landed on Mandy, who had not only finished the article, but was looking in my direction. “What does the article mean?” I muttered under my breath. Understanding dawned as she smiled encouragingly and summarised it for me. MAKING MANDARIN A “LIVING LANGUAGE” It was clear that Mandy isn’t just good at Mandarin as a subject. She also loves the language, culture and pretty much everything to do with it. When we were given the lyrics of a song by Taiwanese singer Jay Chou and asked to identify lines which we could use to encourage a friend, she looked over my shoulder and offered to help me, telling me that she had already memorised all the lyrics to the song. And in an in-class essay about her dreams and aspirations, she wrote about how she hopes to influence others to love Chinese history, and learn more about it. “I love the culture because I think it’s very interesting,” she told me. “I love how in a Chinese word, just a small dot or dash could make a very big difference.” Mandy, who comes from Malaysia and says she speaks mostly Mandarin at home, has a standard that I could only aspire to reach. But the number of students like her – who come from a Mandarin-speaking background – may be diminishing. According to the 2015 General Household Survey released by the Department of Statistics, 36.9 per cent of residents aged five and above used English as the main language at home, up from 32.3 per cent in 2010. At Tanjong Katong Secondary, Mrs Lee said about 70 per cent of students come from an English-speaking background. “They only use Mandarin when they are with us in school,” she explained. “So it is really important to keep them engaged and be really active in learning during Chinese lessons. That is why a lot of the pedagogies and teaching practices have changed to help students discover that it’s not a subject, but a living language.” “So besides the text, we use videos, additional reading and newspapers, and we open up all the possible modes of learning to students,” she added. “And the students can have the option to pursue their interests further by reading a novel or listening to Mandarin songs.” “For students who come from purely English-speaking families, this is a way in which they can learn to use the language in different contexts when they leave us and graduate.” Brina Lai, another of my classmates, said she speaks mostly English at home, and counts English Literature as one of her favourite subjects. She agreed that it can be difficult at times to speak Mandarin fluently. But she makes it a point to practise by having conversations in Mandarin with friends and family members, and exposing herself to Chinese shows. “I enjoy it when the teacher shows videos in class,” she said. “I understand how the characters feel, and how they speak. I can learn a lot from the way they phrase their sentences.”   “When I talk to my friends in class, it also helps,” she added. “Because my friends tell me if I make a mistake.” OVERCOMING THE STUMBLING BLOCKS  True enough, I found that having to attend lessons regularly, read the materials and speak the language did help improve my fluency and raise my confidence. Perhaps it was the fact that I was now a working adult and fully understood – through painful experience – the importance of using the language in the course of my work. But I also felt that referencing current affairs and famous people in the lesson, as well as using news articles and song lyrics that we already knew of through our social media feeds helped tremendously in emphasising the importance and relevance of the language in our daily lives. This, I felt, was a lesson that the 14-year-old me would have appreciated. As the days went by, things started to take a turn for the better. My face lost the furrowed brow and perplexed expression that were a mainstay for much of the first lesson. As the teaching progressed, the in-class activities were designed to build on what I had already learnt, forcing me to constantly refer to my hastily scribbled notes and use the new vocabulary and cheng yu I had learnt in my assignments. Of course, there were moments when I stumbled. Like the time when I had to present my group’s work to the class, and couldn’t read the words my groupmate had written. Or the time when Mrs Lee called on me to answer one of her questions, and I unthinkingly blurted out, “Are you seriously asking me?” in English before I could stop myself, eliciting laughter from everyone in class. But by my final day, I was able to produce a 150-word essay in class, on the topic of my dreams and aspirations.  I was able to understand and appreciate the beauty and richness of the language, from the different literary devices used to the varying ways of structuring sentences in Mandarin. And I was able to make a farewell speech in Mandarin to the class, thanking them for all their help and encouragement, and promising them that I would go back and write an inspiring story about my experience. I wouldn't say that I become an overnight prodigy after my stint in the classroom. I also wouldn't say that the three short days worked a miracle in improving my fluency or getting me to love the language more. But it has encouraged me to use the language more in my daily life. Where I once shunned everything and anything to do with Chinese culture, I now find myself actively seeking out Chinese-language songs to listen to on my daily commute, or practising my comprehension skills by reading news articles in Mandarin.  My spoken Mandarin might still be hesitant, and I may still lack the vocabulary to express myself in the same way I would in the English language.  But after thinking that I could do little more than write my name in Chinese, I emerged from the classroom with a little more confidence in myself and my abilities.

While Alan is gainfully employed and earns a decent salary of S$2,500 a month, the family of three struggles financially.  They have no savings but sustained debt, amounting to approximately S$5,000. It appears that the couple lacks the wisdom to budget, and had not been prudent in their expenses. Mani is a 21-year-old with a Primary 5 education who struggles to secure employment. She has a child, aged 5, with her first boyfriend whom she no longer keeps in touch with. With her second boyfriend, she has a second child, aged 2. Mani and her 25-year-old boyfriend, Selva, have no savings and rely on Selva’s parents for their children’s basic needs.  They approached our social workers for help with their young children’s expenses. It appears that the couple had made a poor decision to have children out of wedlock, which seemed like an irresponsible choice especially when they are not economically self-sufficient. ANOTHER TALE, A MOTHER WHO WANTS TO WORK Siti, a stay-home mum for 20 years, was another individual who sought help. She has three children, aged 16, 13 and 10. Her 45-year-old husband, Abdullah, is gainfully employed as a security guard and earns S$1,800 a month but his health does not permit him to work longer hours.  While it seems like a reasonable expectation for Siti to go into the workforce and earn an income to supplement her husband’s, she experiences great anxiety going for interviews. She also experiences great distress thinking that her children’s needs might be compromised should she work.  On the surface, it appears that all three households lacks the skills and wisdom needed to make the “right choices” and live self-reliant and independent lives.  In a bid to improve their situations, social workers are quick to teach Charis and Alan budgeting skills, persuade Mani to accept any job that comes her way, and convince Siti to step into the workforce.  The practitioners typically hope to see some improvements in their situation in three to six months – the same period over which recipients of the most commonly-known and most widely distributed social assistance scheme ComCare receive aid.  The assumption is that these families should be able to resolve their situations in that period, since ComCare is not meant to be a long-term assistance scheme. FRACTURED LIVES STRUGGLING EVERYDAY Within a few months of interacting with Charis and Alan, we soon found out that Charis had experienced abuse as a child. Alan himself had been trapped in the poverty cycle all his life.  We then wondered if their fractured early childhood experiences, the everyday stress and lived insecurities from a young age made it different for them to focus on seemingly simple tasks that the rest of us take for granted, such as budgeting. As we got to know Mani, we realised that she struggled to secure employment because she has no one to help care for her young children on weekends. Given her educational qualifications, the jobs available to her typically require her to work weekends or after childcare operating hours.  When many working mothers have the support of grandparents, domestic workers or family friends to care for their children, Mani does not have that luxury. Siti reacted angrily to her social worker pressing her to work. She gave many reasons why she could not find a job. A few weeks later, when under tremendous stress, Siti yelled at her social worker. She asked her social worker to stop pressing her to work. She said: You do not understand my situation. DIVE INTO POVERTY’S COMPLEXITIES Economic self-sufficiency has always been the goal of all anti-poverty programmes and all social service practitioners wish this for the poor. However, in our urgency to move these families to economic self-sufficiency, we sometimes forget to delve deeper into the complexities of poverty. Children from poor families are more likely to experience developmental delays and learning difficulties compared to their peers. They are also more likely to experience anxiety, depression and difficulties with impulse control.  Plenty of research point to the impact of the toxic stress of poverty on children’s brain development, which sometimes continues into adulthood.  When these children grow up, they are more likely to experience similar psychological problems, including persistent negative thinking. These problems are not easily reversed by budgeting exercises or financial management workshops.  Employment assistance programmes may help with money and give them the confidence to secure a job, but will not eradicate this scourge of poverty. SIX MONTHS IS NOT ENOUGH  When we understand the psychological impact of poverty and the effects on a person’s mental and emotional well-being, we may realise that six months isn’t enough to help someone move out of poverty.  We may also realise that behavourial strategies focusing on changing individual behaviour should only be applied after we address some of these adults’ more pressing and fundamental mental health issues and early childhood trauma.  When we focus only on skills development and mindset change, we miss the mark, because we do not truly address the root of the problem that traps people in poverty. Charis and Alan are still meeting their social worker regularly. Charis sometimes ignores her social worker and accuses her of not being supportive. Her social worker, understanding that she has difficulties trusting others, is still pressing on to connect with her, offering her empathy and understanding.  With the help of their social worker, Mani has managed to engage Selva’s mother to care for the two young children. The social worker helped the family negotiate a care arrangement that is sustainable for the family.  After two years, Mani and Selva married and moved into a new flat of their own but they continue to require the support of Selva’s mother to care for their children. With a lot of handholding, support, understanding and encouragement, Siti finally stepped out to work part-time after eight months. She struggled to cope with the household responsibilities and the demands of her new job. She finally gained regular employment in a restaurant but the path to that, which included securing but losing another job along the way, was not linear or easy. In eradicating poverty, efforts must be made to understand the complexities behind poverty.  The poor can’t just snap out of it and the privilege of being economically comfortable that confers us advantages in pursuing success is invisible to those who have it.  Those of us who enjoy this privilege must find ways to understand the psyche of those who experience poverty daily. Perhaps it is when we do so that we can change the way we design and implement our anti-poverty programmes to greater effectiveness.

This is part of a series of enhancements to its undergraduate curriculum that it announced on Thursday (Sep 6), following a one-year study by the school’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Undergraduate Education. Students will be able to alternate between working at least four days at their host company, and studying on campus for up to one day each week. They will be able to take up to two courses during the work-study period. The university explained that the new option recognises the value of longer internship durations, which enable students to “better interlace institution-based learning with structured on-the-job training”.  It will also facilitate “more substantial and impactful work opportunities” within the attachment company. The work-study option will be piloted through selected programmes, including the university’s recently launched Health Economics and Management second major. Based on the pilot run, SMU will review and refine it before rolling it out on a larger scale. The university has also redesigned its undergraduate core curriculum into three inter-related pillars: capabilities, communities and civilisations. The new core curriculum will be implemented from academic year 2019-2020. Under the new core curriculum, internships and community service will become credit-bearing programmes. Currently, the two programmes are graduation requirements for all undergraduates, but do not carry any credit. From the current academic year, SMU will also introduce a new exploratory course scheme to encourage students to experiment with classes outside their major or their usual sphere of interest.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smu-pilot-programme-students-intern-and-study-at-same-time-10695944"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 10:46PM", "tags": ["crime", "Singapore Police Force", "scams"], "author": "", "title": "Man arrested for multiple online scams involving flight vouchers and Universal Studios, NDP tickets", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 30-year-old online seller has been arrested for allegedly cheating multiple victims who had paid to buy tickets to Universal Studios Singapore (USS), National Day Parade, concerts, as well as flight vouchers from him.  The victims - who reported the incidents to the police between February and June - said that the suspect became uncontactable after they made payment for the purchases via bank transfers, the police said in a news release on Friday (Sep 7).  The suspect was arrested on Thursday and will be charged with cheating on Saturday.

The visitors took the lead in the fourth minute through Jonathan Justin, before 19-year-old Ikhsan found the net in the 75th minute as the Lions claimed a credible draw. Fandi Ahmad, who was appointed as the interim coach in May by the Football Association of Singapore, will lead the national team for the 2018 ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Suzuki Cup in November. Singapore last won the biennial tournament in 2012 and are without a competitive victory in almost three years. Fandi showed he was not afraid to inject fresh blood into the side, handing debuts to brothers Zulqarnaen and Zulfadhmi Suzliman against a Mauritian team 14 spots above Singapore, who are ranked 169th, in the FIFA rankings.  Despite the Singapore team averaging just 25 years old, a gritty display against a physical Mauritius side pleased Fandi, who lauded his boys’ efforts. “I thought everybody played very well. I’m just happy that the team is gelling though we’ve only had four to five sessions together,” Fandi said after the game. “There’s no fear in these boys, we have to have faith and belief that these are the right choice of players.” The Mauritians weren’t standing on ceremony for the new Lions boss and took the lead after just four minutes. A Jeremy Villeneuve shot was parried by Singapore custodian Izwan Mahbud but Justin, who played for Etoile FC in the S.League in 2011, was on hand to poke home the loose ball. It took the Lions almost 16 minutes to register their first shot - as Ikhsan forced Kevin Jean-Louis into a save. Safuwan Baharudin was next to try his luck five minutes later but his dipping volley dropped comfortably into the keeper’s hands.  Singapore’s best outlet was the nippy Zulfadhmi on the left and he almost got himself on the scoresheet midway through the first half but his shot was saved. Describing 22-year-old Zulfadhmi’s showing as “superb”, Fandi was keen to stress that he is willing to give young players such as the Tampines Rovers winger a chance to break into the side. “Everybody has to buck up and be on their toes, because for me, I don’t see age as a barrier,” Fandi explained. “Anybody that comes (into the national set-up), we will give them a chance.” Francisco Filho’s away side almost doubled Mauritius' lead early in the second half, a fizzing strike from Gary Noel forcing Izwan into a stunning fingertip save as he kept the home side in the game.  It looked like it was going to be another frustrating outing for the Lions, until Ikhsan's intervention. “I’m happy for him because he made his first start and scored,” said Fandi. “He never started in his four caps (for Singapore) but he scored today which I think gave him a lot of confidence.”  Singapore have three more international friendlies lined up - Fiji next Tuesday (Sep 11), Mongolia (Oct 12) and Cambodia (Oct 16), before heading to a training camp in Japan as preparation for the Suzuki Cup.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/ikhsan-fandi-opens-account-fandi-ahmad-singapore-mauritius-10695714"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 09:08PM", "tags": ["hawker", "hawker culture", "ci yuan hawker centre", "fei siong"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Extra fees of S$650 levied on some Ci Yuan hawkers a ‘miscommunication’: Fei Siong management", "content": " SINGAPORE: The S$600 quality control management fee and S$50 coin exchange fee levied on hawkers at Ci Yuan Hawker Centre in Hougang are optional for some of its hawkers, Fei Siong Food Management clarified on Friday (Sep 7).  The social enterprise which operates the hawker centre was responding to unhappiness voiced by some stall holders that the S$650 monthly fee – which is on top of rental costs – was compulsory. \"We believe it's some miscommunication from our team to hawkers,\" said Fei Siong Food Management's group general manager Joe Sng. He explained that the S$600 fee, in particular, was introduced in July to address concerns by the management on food portions sold by hawkers. Ci Yuan Hawker Centre, which is one of the seven social enterprise hawker centres running on an alternative management model, gets hawkers to provide at least one S$2.80 meal at their stall.  After complaints from residents about shrinking food portions, the management introduced the S$600 quality control service to address this issue.  Mr Sng said that the quality control is done by Fei Siong's own in-house employees.  The operations team at the hawker centre goes on patrols to look at the quality, portion and hygiene standards of the food. It also conducts “mystery shopping” to check on the dishes served by hawkers.  \"Looking at the charges as a whole, I think it is reasonable,\" Mr Sng told reporters. \"We're doing this because we are insisting on our brand and quality. When we manage Ci Yuan, people will think of Fei Siong. If we're not doing a good job, it will affect our Fei Siong group. So on this point, we emphasise the food quality, food prices and food cleanliness regulations,\" he added.  Channel NewsAsia understands that Ci Yuan Hawker Centre is the only one to implement such a fee for quality control. While other social enterprise operators like OTMH and NTUC Foodfare conduct food quality and hygiene audits for hawkers, they do not charge stall owners a fee. SOME PAY, AND SOME DON'T Mr Sng emphasised that the services are optional for some of its hawkers – specifically those who were not part of the operator’s Entrepreneurship Programme.  Under the programme, aspiring hawkers receive training, mentorship as well as financial help with the setting up of their own hawker stalls, potentially saving up to S$30,000 for renovation and equipment required to run a hawker stall.  Of the 40-odd stalls at Ci Yuan hawker centre, 15 are owned by those who have gone through the programme, said Mr Sng. And the extra fees are compulsory for these hawkers. For the other hawkers who started their own stall on their own dime, they are not required to pay for the S$600 quality control management fee should they choose to not take up the service. However eight stall holders have, according to the operator.  When Channel NewsAsia spoke to the hawkers, one said he was informed this week that the fees are optional and believed it to be compulsory since July when the extra fees kicked in.  Two said that they have known all along that the fees are optional, and the owners of at least four stalls said they are still unaware that they can opt out of the extra services. To tackle the miscommunication, Mr Sng said his team will \"definitely improve on this area and make sure that everything is actually addressed accordingly\". One hawker who was part of the Entrepreneurship Programme said he is happy to pay the extra fees, even though the amount is higher – at S$1,000 – for participants of the programme. Mr Derrick Lee said he benefited from the hawker training programme when he joined the industry with zero culinary skills. He pays more than S$4,000 every month for his stall, including the quality control management fee. He added that the S$1,000 in extra fees sounds reasonable to him.  \"When I signed on the dotted line, I didn't ... thrash it out with the management and ask what every single thing is for,\" Mr Lee said, explaining that he was concerned about other things like the rental period and operation requirements such as how many hours he needs to be open a day.  However, he added that the engagement with hawkers on the services and fees could have been done better.  \"I'm not sure whether there were any sessions where all the stallholders were individually called to the management to explain what were the procedures, what the food quality inspection was all about. So it wasn't really communicated to us,\" Mr Lee said.  \"As long as we are here and if we are paying for what we are paying, it's good that we know at least what they are doing. Perhaps it's not an obligation but it would be good that we are told what they are doing,\" he added. SOCIAL ENTERPRISE MODEL A WORK IN PROGRESS The issue of extra fees came into the spotlight after Makansutra founder KF Seetoh wrote about it, saying some of the charges are “shocking”. The prominent food writer and personality also questioned the effectiveness of the social enterprise model in the running of hawker centres. The model of appointing socially conscious operators was introduced in 2015, with the aim of improving operational efficiency while keeping food prices affordable. Earlier on Friday, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor said that this management model, having run for three years, has brought some benefits by enhancing the vibrancy of hawker centres and improving the dining experiences of customers.  \"We will continue to evaluate this alternative management model, take into account suggestions and feedback on this ongoing process,” Dr Khor said during her visit to Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre.  “(We will) see how we can adjust, make refinements to the model so that we can have a better management model for our hawker centres and achieve these fundamental objectives of helping the hawkers make a decent livelihood at the same time and ensuring Singaporeans have access to good quality and affordable food in a hygienic environment,” she added. Dr Khor also said that extra services such as quality control by hawker centre operators should be offered on an optional basis to stall holders. She explained that operating costs such as collecting and cleaning of crockery are already included by the bidder in the tender, and managing agents have to inform the National Environment Agency when they want to offer additional services to hawkers. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ci-yuan-hawker-centre-extra-fees-fei-siong-miscommunication-10694668"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 08:57PM", "tags": ["Police Coast Guard", "crime", "marine gas oil"], "author": "", "title": "10 men arrested for suspected illegal transaction of marine gas oil", "content": " SINGAPORE: Ten men, aged between 27 and 51, have been arrested for their suspected involvement in the illegal transaction of marine gas oil.

On Aug 20 last year, 69-year-old Tang Soh Ha was found dead at the foot of Block 560, Pasir Ris Street 51, where he lived with his wife and three children. His 27-year-old daughter Tang Hui Yee, who was autistic and intellectually disabled, was found lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen of their second-storey home. Delivering her findings on Friday afternoon, State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam said that Mr Tang had been treated for depression and was previously diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder and delirium. About two weeks before the double deaths, Mr Tang consulted a doctor at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) after being referred by a polyclinic for having suicidal thoughts. He said he was having sleep problems and experiencing low mood, with \"fleeting passive suicidal thoughts of dying by jumping from height\". He was unable to sleep and would think about the future of his daughter. Mr Tang was diagnosed with insomnia with secondary depressive features and prescribed a low dose of diazepam to aid his sleep. He was also given a follow-up appointment date and advised to return to the IMH emergency room if he felt suicidal or unable to cope with his symptoms. MR TANG WAS ILL FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DEATHS: SON According to Mr Tang's son, his father had felt very sick about two weeks before his death. He also had thoughts of suicide, which prompted Mr Tang's son to take him to Pasir Ris Polyclinic. After being referred to IMH and receiving prescribed sleeping pills, his father was able to sleep at times.  However, he would complain that he felt tired easily and also made negative remarks such as \"he was burdening the family and who would take care of Ms Tang if he was not around\". The night before the incident, Mr Tang's son returned home to find his father lying awake on the sofa in the living room. At about 3am, he saw his father reading the bible in the kitchen. At about 9am the next day, he saw his father playing with his granddaughter in the kitchen. Almost two hours later, the son left the house with his mother to buy some furniture and groceries. That was the last time he saw his father alive. At about 2pm that day, Mr Tang's son received a call from the police, who told him that something had happened to his family. He rushed home with his mother and saw his father's body on the ground floor. When his mother went up to their home with a police officer, they discovered Ms Tang lying motionless in the kitchen. Mr Tang's son revealed that his dad was the one who generally took care of his sister, and had recently been stressed that he could not care for her properly due to his poor health. HUSBAND WORRIED THAT HIS HEALTH WAS FAILING: WIFE Mr Tang's wife, Madam Yeo, said that \"everything was normal\" when she left the house with her son on the morning of the deaths. Before the incident, however, she noticed that her husband had not been sleeping well and was not his usual self. She said he \"kept thinking of a lot of things\" and was worried about their daughter. He worried that his health was failing, and that there would be no one to take care of her in the future. Ms Tang had moderate intellectual disability and had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at a young age. One week before her death, she went for a review at IMH. She appeared to have a relapse of certain behavioural issues, and would frequently play with water and stand under the shower head with the water running for hours at a time.  She had also hit other people a few times when she did not get her way. NO BASIS TO BELIEVE THIRD PARTY WAS INVOLVED: STATE CORONER The State Coroner said that there was \"no basis to believe that any third party was involved in Ms Tang's demise\", as there were no signs of the home being ransacked. The DNA profiles of the swabs taken from their home belonged either to Mr Tang or his daughter, while blood spatters found on Mr Tang's hands and legs were a match to Ms Tang. Additionally, a blood-stained footprint found next to Ms Tang's body was a match to Mr Tang's right foot. The evidence suggested that Mr Tang had struck Ms Tang from behind with a kitchen knife, causing stab and incised wounds that led to her death. He then killed himself by falling from a height. \"Regrettably, Mr Tang had seemingly decided that the joint demise of both him and his daughter was the solution to his concerns for his daughter's welfare,\" said the State Coroner. \"I extend my condolences to the family of Mr Tang and Ms Tang for their sad loss,\" she added.

He was on lane 1 of a three-lane road, and failed to notice the elderly man, Mr Din Bin Nyak Abdul Rahman, who was crossing the road from his left to his right. Kasim said he first noticed the pedestrian half a car length ahead, but could not change lanes as there was a van on his left. He applied his brakes, but could not avoid hitting the pedestrian. Based on video footage from the in-car camera, Kasim was travelling at an average speed of about 63kmh to 64kmh - slightly higher than the prescribed speed limit of 60kmh.  \"At the material time, the deceased was not crossing within 50m of a pedestrian crossing or overhead bridge, and was not jaywalking,\" the prosecutor said. The elderly man arrived in hospital in a state of cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was attempted but he was pronounced dead later that day. The cause of death was found to be multiple injuries sustained to the head, cervical spine and chest. The deceased was found to have severe ischaemic heart disease, which could have contributed to his death, court documents said.  FOCUS SHOULD NOT BE ON WHAT VICTIM SHOULD HAVE DONE: PROSECUTOR Deputy Public Prosecutor Ho Lian-Yi asked for four weeks' jail. He said: \"In this case, a lot of focus was on what the deceased should have done. But that's not the point.\" Kasim's defence lawyer John Koh asked for a fine of S$7,000 and four years' disqualification from driving, saying that \"the deceased's failure to exercise adequate duty of care was a significant contributory cause of his death\". He said there was an overhead bridge near the accident site where the pedestrian could have crossed instead. \"This particular stretch of road is notorious for errant pedestrian crossings and this is further substantiated by the authorities' decision to erect railings at the centre road divider to further deter the same,\" said Mr Koh. District Judge Samuel Chua agreed with the prosecution's suggested sentence, but allowed Kasim to defer his sentence for three weeks. For causing death by a negligent act, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/road-accident-man-jailed-elderly-pedestrian-killed-10694038"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 03:01PM", "tags": ["MEWR", "hawkers", "Amy Khor"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Alternative social enterprise hawker management model still being evaluated: Amy Khor", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Government will continue to observe and evaluate the alternative social enterprise hawker management model that is currently implemented at seven hawker centres, Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said on Friday (Sep 7). The Government has been exploring alternative management models for hawker centres by engaging socially conscious operators to improve operational efficiency while ensuring affordable food.  The social enterprise hawker centres include Ci Yuan Hawker Centre, Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre, Yishun Park Hawker Centre, Jurong West Hawker Centre, Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre, Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre and Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre.  Dr Khor’s comments, made during a visit to Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre, comes after some hawkers at social enterprise hawker centres said they were unhappy about extra charges levied on top of rental and other compulsory operating costs.  “Indeed we are very mindful that we need to ensure that hawkers have a decent livelihood ... In addition to lower rental and total operating costs, we give more weight to those who offer lower costs. We also make sure that managing agents are not allowed to increase rental or operating costs over the lease period,” Dr Khor said.  She added that the model has only been implemented for three years, and the Government is still learning and evaluating it.  “We will continue to evaluate this alternative model, take into account suggestions and feedback on this ongoing process,” Dr Khor said.  Dr Khor said that hawkers and hawker centre patrons have benefited from the alternative management model which has brought about a more vibrant hawker scene and improved dining experience.  Managing agents have to ensure a “good mix” of food offerings as well as affordable meals, she said.  On the additional services offered by managing agents such as the coin exchange service, and the quality control service as offered by Fei Siong Food Management - costing S$600 - Dr Khor explained that they are optional.  Dr Khor added that operating costs such as collecting and cleaning of crockery are already included by the bidder in the tender, and managing agents have to inform the National Environment Agency when they want to offer additional services to hawkers.  However, there is a need to “give some leeway to innovation” which can enhance the management of these social enterprise hawker centres, she said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/alternative-social-enterprise-hawker-management-model-still-10693924"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 02:34PM", "tags": ["food safety", "Giant supermarket"], "author": "Melissa Zhu", "title": "Scraps of plastic found in packets of minced meat bought from Giant supermarket", "content": " SINGAPORE: When executive Candy Chan, 47, returned from work on Tuesday (Sep 4), she was confronted with an unappetising situation: There was plastic mixed into the minced pork her domestic helper had bought.  In a post on Facebook that has since been shared more than 3,000 times, Ms Chan wrote that her helper purchased the meat at about 3pm from supermarket chain Giant's outlet at Marine Terrace, and discovered the plastic after boiling the meat.  Ms Chan told her helper to return to the supermarket and purchase another packet of the same meat.

Mr Shanmugam also recalled how founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had been “sympathetic” and “expressed his understanding for those who are gay”. \"The law is there but generally there have been no prosecutions for private conduct,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"People openly express themselves as gay, you got the gay parade. Police even approved a licensing for it, no-one gets prosecuted for declaring themselves as gay,\" he noted. “So really when was the last time someone was prosecuted?” As for his own personal views on the matter, Mr Shanmugam said: “Speaking for myself, if you ask me, in a personal capacity, personal view - people's lifestyles, sexual attitudes, (we) really should be careful about treating them as criminals or criminalising that. “But again it will be wrong for me to impose my personal views on society or as a policymaker,” he qualified. “We live our lives, live and let live.

Lee Chao Hunt was arrested in January earlier this year, a few months after a victim made a police report. The victim said Lee had asked him to make an advance payment into a bank account, in exchange for sexual services thereafter. However, Lee could not be contacted after the victim made the payment. Lee, who faces 17 charges, allegedly cheated 16 victims in total between June and November last year, asking them to transfer sums of between S$150 and S$200 to him.

Tommy Koh, who is Ambassador-at-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the comments in response to a Facebook post by a senior Singapore-based academic on India's landmark ruling on Thursday. Simon Chesterman, dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, shared a New York Times story on the ruling, congratulating a former classmate and others on the change. \"I would encourage our gay community to bring a class action to challenge the constitutionality of Section 377A,\" Professor Koh wrote.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Previous legal challenges in 2014 on the constitutionality of the law failed.

We hurtle towards the weapon. I get there first and, naturally, try to stab him in the neck. But in a few swift, powerful moves my arm ends up hyperextended, the blade prised from my fingers and the rest of my body virtually immobilised. It was probably a bit too easy for him, as a member of the Special Task Force (STF) unit in the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), Singapore’s drug enforcement agency. Drills like these - which simulate the danger of a knife attack (albeit using dummy knives) - are all in a day’s work for an elite, covert strike team trained to be the bane of drug syndicates everywhere. Since its formation in 1997, details about the STF, such as its number of personnel, remain secret for operational reasons. But one thing is for sure - they are likely behind every high-profile, major drug seizure by CNB. Recently the bureau decided to publicly showcase the STF in a weekly series of social media videos, “to highlight the good, tough and dangerous work that they do, putting their lives on the line to help fight for a safer and drug-free Singapore”, said a CNB spokesperson. The clips depict skills which STF members are annually assessed on, such as forced entry, firearms marksmanship, unarmed combat and more.  But to first join the STF, CNB officers - who are all full-time “regulars” - must complete their two-year foundation postings before being eligible to apply. They are then put through a battery of physical, psychometric and scenario-based tests. Upon selection, a further three month-long conversion course awaits - and candidates must pass this to be deployed operationally. Asked if there was a typical profile of an STF member, the unit’s senior assistant director, Superintendent William Tan, said: “Generally, everyone is physically fit, but we come in all shapes and sizes. Because of the nature of the job, we don’t wear uniform at times, so we need people who can blend into the environment - we avoid those who stand out in a crowd.”  He described an average day of an STF member as waiting by the phone to be activated. “A operation doesn’t just happen in a single day,” Supt Tan, who has clocked eight years in the STF, explained. “There’s a build-up: We know in advance who our adversaries are, we know the ground, it’s only a question of when to hit.” FROM SMASHING WINDOWS TO BEING SMASHED While waiting, members do the next best thing - train. And this includes driving two cars in and out of cones with bumper to boot, plus executing movie-style reverse turns and drifts. But Supt Tan cautioned: “We don’t want them to drive like this on the road. The training is for them to have better control and handling of the vehicle. “A lot of it is instilling teamwork too, when we have several vehicles on the road, they must have confidence and understanding in each other.” After intercepting a suspect’s vehicle, the next step often involves smashing windows. “The door will be locked - we won’t have the most cooperative suspect who will open and surrender, so they have to experience that in training,” Supt Tan explained. I got to do so, as well, when they handed me a baton and taught me to use its tough, tempered base to shatter the glass with just one hit.   This, and being a passenger in a spinning, screeching car, was good fun. Playing a suspect sitting inside and struggling against arrest - less so. “Inside the car, in that confined environment, often they have weapons hidden so we must prepare for all these scenarios,” said Supt Tan. They were prepared alright - moving in fast and fluid to pin my head, arms and legs before cuffing and dragging me out of the vehicle. More helplessness was in store when I was given a taste of their close-quarter defence training, which takes up an entire third of the aforementioned three-month conversion course. STF members do not learn a specific fighting system but rather a pick and mix of suitable elements from different styles. The training equips them to fend off attacks by both unarmed individuals as well as those wielding weapons - such as knives. Cue the knife scramble exercise: Whether as aggressor or defender, over and over I was outsmarted and outmanoeuvred by my STF partner, leaving me with a sprained thumb and multiple aches and abrasion. “We have our vocal commands, we have our hands, we have our baton, our firearm. Depending on the level of aggression we’re facing, we will use an appropriate level of force to apprehend - one that is not excessive,” said Supt Tan. He added that the training also simulates dealing with individuals who may be under the influence of drugs and thus stronger or even “immune to pain” - by having members practice taking on someone fully suited up in pads. READY FOR THE WORST For Supt Tan, the STF has taken on increasing relevance today. “We need to be specialised in skills and tools to handle drug syndicates which are more sophisticated and innovative than before - in the technology they use and the way they do transactions,” he noted. Over 17 years in CNB, he has trained for and participated in his fair share of operations, where suspects aggressively attempting to evade arrest - including one armed with a crowbar - are “part and parcel” of the job.  The one time he and his team were taken by surprise: A case where they had to apprehend suspects and ensure the safety of a toddler at the same time. Perhaps no amount of training can stop one from expressing shock at such a scenario - but otherwise, the STF remains devoted to preparing for the worst cases, said Supt Tan. The dreaded 14-station “circuit” test to end their month-long unarmed combat training is an excruciating example of this. I underwent a watered-down version with half the number of stages, but boy was it tough: In between sparring and doing burpees plus jumping jacks, groups of at least four men were roughhousing and boxing me in with giant pads - while other STF members stood around screaming, shouting and banging objects to recreate the utter chaos and confusion of a possible real-life operation. “We won’t see people tapping out or giving up, but one typical sight is them throwing up,” Supt Tan smiled. “To ask someone to do a drill in normal circumstances, anybody can. But under duress, fatigue and exhaustion - that’s where we see who still can perform and who will fumble under pressure … The circuit helps us understand the individual.” It’s true. Completely winded by the second stage, and barely able to breathe and stand by the last, there and then I understood perfectly why my namecard spelt “journalist” and not “Special Task Force”.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-elite-special-task-force-cnb-drugs-covert-strike-team-10690772"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 11:12AM", "tags": ["Digital TV", "Mediacorp"], "author": "", "title": "A reminder to Singapore households: Switch to digital TV", "content": " SINGAPORE: Come Sep 17, Singapore households which have not made the switch to digital TV (DTV) will see a smaller picture on their TV screens, as a visual reminder for them to make the switch before analogue TV signals are switched off on Dec 31.   On top of that, there will be on-screen instructions to inform viewers how to make the switch to DTV.  Accordingly to Mediacorp’s survey on DTV adoption in Singapore, about four in five Singapore households are already enjoying DTV.  This includes households that enjoy DTV through their PayTV subscriptions.

Seems like no better time than now for Scream Asia Film Festival - Singapore’s first ever horror film festival.  Organised by mm2 Entertainment and Cathay Cineplexes, the inaugural festival, which runs from Oct 19 to 28, will screen a total of 11 feature films and one short film, including the J J Abrams-produced Overlord, Lars von Trier’s The House that Jack Built and upcoming Singaporean film Zombiepura. In attendance will be closing film They Who Are Not Seen director Billy Christian and Overlord director Julis Avery. Curated by homegrown award-winning auteur Eric Khoo and South Korean film programmer Jongsuk Thomas Nam, Scream Asia Film Festival also boasts horror filmmaking master classes taught by acclaimed directors Yeon Sang-ho and Joko Anwar. The former directed the 2016 box-office hit Train To Busan, which became the highest grossing Korean film in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.  The latter is an Indonesian horror stalwart who directed Satan's Slaves, which was not only the highest grossing Indonesian horror film of all time but also the highest grossing Indonesian film of 2017. “For all aspiring filmmakers in Singapore and the region, I cannot think of two better directors to learn from than Sang-ho and Joko,” Khoo said. “Especially in the genre of horror.” Khoo, a self-professed horror film buff and the festival’s creative director, told CNA Lifestyle that he believes that horror films are “the way to go” in growing both our local and regional film industry.  “They are the cheapest to make and yield the highest returns,” he said with a laugh. “Look at the box-office numbers Joko’s Satan's Slaves brought in. It’s incredible that a horror film is the highest-grossing Indonesian film of 2017.” He continued: “Horror films have long been seen as ‘B-grade’. But really, a lot of these films end up creating so much, even though they have miniscule budgets. It’s because they have to work even harder, especially on the creative (front), and really push the boundaries and get things done.” Which is why Khoo is hoping that Scream Asia Film Festival will be the platform to help push and encourage the next generation of Singapore filmmakers. He told CNA Lifestyle exclusively that the festival is “looking to introduce a short film-making competition section next year”.  The winner will see their short film produced by organisers mm2 Entertainment, who are also behind other local horror films such as 23:59 The Haunting Hour (2018), Bring Back the Dead (2014), Ghost Child (2013) and the upcoming Zombiepura (2018). “Asia has an immense thirst for the horror genre so the time is ripe to create an iconic horror film festival here,” he added. “We hope that Scream Asia will make our little red dot the hub for horror film fans and filmmakers from the region.” Agreed Ng Say Yong, mm2 Entertainment’s Chief Content Officer: “Asia lends itself naturally to the horror genre because its historical and cultural landscape is filled with stories of ghosts, black magic, and a myriad assortment of exorcists and mediums,” he said. “Some of the most iconic and scary horror films have come from this region. It's therefore important to establish a horror film festival here… and showcase works that are less known, and develop a platform for regional filmmakers to gather and make even better horror movies.” Tickets are on sale from Sep 10 at cathaycineplexes.com.sgFestival brochures with the schedule and film information will be available at all Cathay Cineplexes locations.For more information, visit screamasiafilmfest.com", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/singapore-first-ever-horror-film-festival-scream-asia-eric-khoo-10692198"}, {"datetime": "07 Sep 2018 06:17AM", "tags": ["employment", "work life", "labour", "data", "office"], "author": "Fermin Diez", "title": "Commentary: Tricky human resource questions best dealt with facts instead of feelings", "content": " SINGAPORE: Nobel prize-winning economist Ronald Coase once said: If you torture the data long enough, it will confess! This is a useful starting point for which to discuss the use of data. I find the use of data in human resources (HR) to have an especially huge potential. The organisations that will win the war for talent, especially in manpower-lean economies like Singapore, will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. But the well-worn phrases organisations have that “people are our greatest assets” and  “HR is our ultimate competitive advantage” will finally ring true when HR focuses on solving business problems as opposed to people problems. HR MUST USE FACTS TO SOLVE BUSINESS PROBLEMS No professional entering the HR field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid mastery of how data can help organisations make recruitment, retention and progression decisions based on facts. Linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and incentive pay models, in fact, have little correlation with future business results. So it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to manage and incentivise people in the organisation. But HR analytics should not be left only to data scientists. Each HR practitioner needs to be armed with practical, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance, which include the ability to: HR professionals need to embrace analytics, and speak its business language, if they are truly to get the much coveted “seat at the table” among the company’s key decision makers. Most business leaders speak in numbers, financial and otherwise. If HR wants to be heard, it needs to be able to put HR arguments in business language - meaning using data that links HR decisions to business outcomes. Otherwise, discussions about HR matters becomes one’s “gut” versus somebody else’s “gut”. The worst outcome is that business leaders ignore the manpower recommendations HR offers, thinking that they know better. Many HR professionals harbour a fear that “I am not a numbers person; how can I do analytics?” While it is true that basic knowledge of finance and statistics is required, analytics is a skill, not a talent, and can be learnt. Interpreting the data is just as important, including what stories the numbers tell. The HR professional that has a handle on analytics is better positioned to answer business questions from top management, for instance, what the profile of a company’s sales force that will best help it to increase sales revenue growth looks like. He or she is also able to use HR analytical tools to improve employment outcomes for employees – for instance if he or she can evaluate which combination of employee benefits and work-life balance programmes delivers the highest staff engagement. WHEN FACTS HELPED NAVIGATE A TRICKY ISSUE A company was looking to determine which profile of sales force made most sense in its growth strategy. HR interviewed several sales managers and discovered each had their own preferences, and there was no consensus, nor evidence, that any of these approaches worked better. The HR team collected data on sales results for each of the sales people in the last three years, and combined it with information from other internal systems. After months of analysis they had a great deal of insights and numbers to show. They began their presentation on the results with a handful of slides which basically started with\" “Do you want to increase sales results by X% over the next 12 to 18 months? If you do, you need to change the profile of your sales force so that it matches these attributes A, B, C and D.” They expected pushback from veteran sales managers who had “always done it this way”. To their surprise, there were no questions whatsoever. After a long silence, the CEO said, “Ok, it’s agreed, let’s do this!”, and moved on to the next topic on the agenda. After more than a year, the team went to evaluate the results and discovered that those regions that had changed the sales force to the indicated profile saw even better sales results than estimated. So it seems starting with the right business question, as opposed to starting with the data available, was the key in this instance. In fact, the most common misunderstanding about analytics is that, if you look at data hard enough, and take time to “torture it”, you will find insights.

The details, posted online on the church's news platform The Catholic News, come five days after the Archbishop of Singapore Most Reverend William Goh revealed in a pastoral message that there were \"a handful\" of allegations of abuse involving the Church in Singapore.  Those cases were handed over to the Professional Standards Office (PSO) of the Archdiocese for investigation and later judged to be inconclusive, he added in the post on Sep 1. On Thursday, the church revealed in detail how the PSO deals with such cases and the steps taken to promote a safe environment. \"The Catholic Church in Singapore has in place a document that promotes a safe environment, including the implementation of a protocol to receive any complaint of sexual abuse or harassment of a minor or young person,\" it said. This document, it said, sets out the procedures to \"ensure a just treatment of all complaints in a transparent and judicial manner\".  Allegations may be against priests, as well as employees or volunteers in the Archdiocese, it added.  COMPLAINANTS ADVISED TO REPORT TO AUTHORITIES According to the post, the PSO \"strongly advises\" all complaints to be reported to the appropriate civil authorities to ensure that investigations are carried out professionally and independently.  Once the matter has been reported to the authorities, the PSO will cease all involvement until the results of the investigations are out. The alleged perpetrator will be suspended from duty until the authorities have concluded their investigations and the Archbishop has been notified of the results.  Where the investigation finds the case to be inconclusive or if the accused is found not guilty, the Archbishop will decide if the accused is to return to duty, the post stated.  If the accused is found guilty and if the case involves a member of the clergy, \"Rome will be duly informed\", after which it will invoke the applicable provisions of Canon Law and instruct the Archbishop to execute accordingly, it added.  In addition to this, the accused will be \"subject to sentencing according to the laws of the land\", and \"the work of restoring communion will then begin\".  CONVENING AN INQUIRY COMMITTEE Should a complainant choose not to file a police report, the PSO will convene an inquiry committee to look into the matter.  The PSO would require the complainant to sign a statutory declaration assuring that the statements and facts raised are true and accurate.  \"Should the complainant choose to lodge a police report midway through the inquiry, he or she has the right to do so, in which case the PSO inquiry committee will immediately cease its investigations so as not to obstruct or interfere with the operation of any relevant agency or civil authorities.  It is always the preference of the PSO that civil authorities conduct investigations to avoid any bias or partiality, according to the post.  The church revealed that the PSO is made up professionals comprising senior law counsels, former district judges, senior lawyers, legally trained persons, psychologists, as well as people in senior management, some of whom are not Catholics but have come forward to assist the PSO in its work.  It said: \"The investigations by PSO and the outcomes are confidential, including all the proceedings at any inquiry. \"At no point during the investigation does the Archdiocese or the Archbishop’s Office interfere with the investigations by the PSO Inquiry Committee or Review Committee.

Gurcharan Singh, a 61-year-old cleaner, usually made the 999 calls after drinking alcohol, the court heard. The latest incidents occurred over two days in June this year, with Singh making two calls on the first day and 15 on the second. On Jun 10, Singh called the police using a public phone at a void deck in Chai Chee. As the operator could not hear what he was saying, he asked him to call back with another phone. Singh then told the operator: \"You are stupid.\" When asked what emergency he was calling about, Singh spoke incoherently about immigration and corruption. He also said: \"I put one dynamite to the immigration house.\" He knew this message to be false, Deputy Public Prosecutor Daphne Lim said. During this phone call, Singh also told the operator: \"You are the police emergency ... you should find out everything in the world what's happening ... and question everything ... all you should have find out ... what a ****ed up police emergency you are.\" The phone call lasted for more than two minutes. He called the emergency hotline a second time later that night, again expressing his unhappiness with the immigration authorities in a call that lasted almost six minutes. He also told the operator that he wanted to meet him and said: \"You are scared to see me ... you got balls to see me not.\" The operators alerted their supervisor. The police then traced Singh's location and officers were dispatched to search for him. He was arrested at the void deck of Block 804 Chai Chee Road that day, and three empty beer cans seized from him.  Despite this, Singh made another 15 calls to the police, all in one day, later that month. REOFFENDED WHILE ON BAIL, BREACHED REMISSION ORDER Singh has been reoffending since 2000, with the most recent conviction in 2016, when he was sentenced to two years' jail, the prosecutor said. She asked for a jail sentence of three years and nine months, noting that Singh reoffended while out on bail and breached his remission order, which makes him liable for an enhanced jail term. \"His underlying problem is alcohol use disorder,\" said Ms Lim. \"There are resources out there that he could have made use of.\" She added that any nuisance calls made to the police deprive people in distress of timely police intervention. Also, because Singh used public phones to make the calls, police resources were expended to track him down. District Judge Eddy Tham said that Singh's \"main issue is that of drinking\". \"After drinking, the accused gets into all kinds of trouble,\" he said. He said there was a period in 2013 when Singh was undergoing a programme with the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) for about eight months, and this seemed to \"make a significant difference\". Singh, who was unrepresented, told the judge that he was sorry and asked for a lighter sentence, saying that he would go for treatment. The judge told him that his alcohol problem was a result of learned behaviour, and that his offences committed while he was in a state of intoxication were very serious, as they affected an important public service. \"Despite long incarceration in the past, there has not been any significant difference except the brief period in NAMS, but this period can offer hope for you,\" he said. \"Just thinking about it and making promises in court does not cut it, you must take action. Hopefully this will be the last time for you.\" On top of his sentence of three years' jail, Singh has an additional enhanced sentence of 66 days for breaching his remission order.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/prank-call-police-jail-singapore-10689402"}, {"datetime": "06 Sep 2018 12:07PM", "tags": ["GIC"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "GIC 'not too perturbed' by recent emerging market rout, sees buying opportunities: CEO", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC is “not too perturbed” by the recent turmoil in emerging markets and according to its CEO Lim Chow Kiat, there may be buying opportunities on the horizon.  Speaking at a technology summit organised by Bloomberg on Thursday (Sep 6), Mr Lim said: “As a long-term investor, we are not too perturbed by it and at least in some markets, it (has given) us some opportunities.”  Without going into specifics, he said there were stocks and bonds where valuations had previously seemed “a bit stretched”. The current market rout may have thrown up a “window of opportunity”, he added.  Concerns over economic crises in some emerging markets, such as Argentina and Turkey, alongside a surge in the US dollar and trade uncertainties, have fed into a wider retreat among other markets.  This has fuelled worries that the turbulence could spread and even spill over into major economies. But Mr Lim reckoned that the recent market volatility boils down to “idiosyncratic” factors that stem from individual difficulties faced by these countries, instead of “systemic-level problems”.  He added that the current flow of international capital out of emerging markets and back to the United States, where the US Federal Reserve is pushing to steadily increase interest rates, is not new.  “We’ve seen that movie before,” he said, while referring to the “dry run” of 2013’s taper tantrum. Then, emerging markets found themselves hit by a bout of panic selling after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke hinted at a reduction in stimulus.  Following that, some emerging markets have taken tough corrective measures to “put the house in order”, said Mr Lim. This includes cutting down on credit expansion and strengthening fundamentals.  “Money tends to flow back to the US because interest rates are higher. Over time, the value will emerge and the money will come back,” he said, while stressing that GIC sees the ongoing rout as a \"shorter-term market concern”.  Nevertheless, GIC is not all sanguine and Mr Lim noted that the sovereign wealth fund is worried about the high valuations in some developed stock markets.  Again without referring to specific markets, he said valuations in these markets are pricing in fairly good economic growth ahead.  “So in terms of risk-reward for an investor, that’s not a great situation to be in.” INVESTING IN TECH During the session, Mr Lim also touched on GIC’s investment strategy in the technology space. Among the factors that the sovereign wealth fund looks out for in a technology firm, Mr Lim highlighted the need for a “relentless” focus on customer value. “Business enterprises ultimately succeed or fail on whether they deliver customer value,” he said. “Good, cheap and fast still matters, perhaps even more so. It’s the great formula for producing unicorns.” GIC also likes emerging markets where powerful technology disruptions can occur due to the presence of more unmet and undiscovered needs, said Mr Lim. With the younger population in these developing economies taking to technology faster, a “well-funded disruptor has many leap-frogging opportunities”, he added. GIC said it has been an investor of technology since its founding. While it started off with investments in listed companies, it began investing in venture capital funds with the set-up of its office in San Francisco in the 1980s.  This required it to make “mental adjustments”, especially when it comes to investing in early-stage technology start-ups that are cash-flow negative and do not have a strong track record. “This requires us to understand the quality of entrepreneurs and have a long-term mindset that we may not see the outcome for a while and have to support the company over many rounds,\" Mr Lim said. It is also key to not be expecting a “100 per cent hit rate” all the time, he added. “We also accept a certain percentage of not getting it right but thankfully, we have been able to find some of these companies.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/gic-ceo-lim-chow-kiat-emerging-markets-opportunities-10689388"}, {"datetime": "06 Sep 2018 10:46AM", "tags": ["Ng Eng Hen", "Thum Ping Tjin", "Kirsten Han"], "author": "", "title": "Foreign dignitaries can be invited to National Day celebrations but only as observers: Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: Foreign dignitaries can be invited to share Singapore's joy and pride during its National Day celebrations but only as observers, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said on Thursday (Sep 6).  In a Facebook post, Dr Ng wrote: \"Let there be no doubt that the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) will organise National Day celebrations only on Aug 9.  \"And to make sure that we can do so every year as Singaporeans, and not as any other nationality, the SAF pledge is to protect Singapore’s independence and sovereignty 'with our lives'.\"  The Defence Minister's comments come after a Facebook post by historian Thum Ping Tjin on Aug 31, in which he wished Singaporeans \"happy unofficial independence day\" on Malaysia's independence day.  \"Selamat Hari Merdeka to the people of the former Federation of Malaya!

The activists sent a letter of complaint on Wednesday to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his capacity as secretary-general of the People's Action Party, disputing that Dr Thum had said that Singapore is part of Malaya.  “It is a huge stretch to suggest that wishing Singaporeans a ‘happy unofficial independence day’ is tantamount to expressing an opinion that Singapore is a part of Malaysia today,” the letter said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/foreign-politicians-national-day-ng-eng-hen-pj-thum-ndp-10689096"}, {"datetime": "06 Sep 2018 09:18AM", "tags": ["Facebook", "technology"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Facebook to build first Asian data centre in Singapore, investing S$1.4 billion", "content": " SINGAPORE: Social media giant Facebook on Thursday (Sep 6) announced it will pour in more than S$1.4 billion to construct its first data centre in Asia in Singapore.  The new facility, located at Tanjong Kling (formerly known as Data Centre Park) in the west of Singapore, will span 170,000 sq m and will “support hundreds of jobs”, the company said in its press release, adding it will form part of its growing presence in Singapore and across the region.  Mr Thomas Furlong, vice president for Infrastructure Data Centers at Facebook, told reporters at the launch event that the new project will create \"thousands of construction jobs\", while the facility will require \"hundreds of operators\" ranging from network maintenance to logistics staff. He added that given it is a long-term project, the company is still working out its staffing needs. Facebook also touted how the facility will be “hyper-efficient” in terms of the use of water, energy and land. For instance, it will incorporate a liquid cooling technology that will minimise water and power consumption and, according to its testing, can reduce the amount of groundwater used by 20 per cent in climates like Singapore’s, it said.  Another example is how the 11-storey building’s facade is made out of a perforated lightweight material that allows air flow, the press release said. Building the data centre upwards, instead of outwards, is also another way of conserving land use, it added. Facebook has selected Fortis Construction to act as its general contractor because of their joint experience building efficient data centres, it added. Mr Furlong said the data centre is estimated to start operations in 2022, but that would just be the first phase and more construction is expected to continue beyond that. \"It's going to take a while,\" he said. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, who graced the launch event, said the social media giant's decision to locate its first Asia data centre here is a \"significant milestone\" for the country.   He said the company's presence here speaks to how Singapore is increasingly connected to the world beyond the traditional modes of air, land and sea. He added that it would facilitate the flow of talent, ideas and creativity into the country.  The new facility will also strengthen the country's role in data storage, which would augment its other strengths in data protection, intellectual property, data security and data analytics, Mr Chan said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/facebook-data-centre-singapore-jobs-asia-10688962"}, {"datetime": "06 Sep 2018 06:13AM", "tags": ["job", "employment", "labour", "work", "hiring"], "author": "Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard", "title": "Commentary: Job seekers, do not settle for second choice ", "content": " SINGAPORE: It’s getting harder to find candidates with the right fit, as job requirements grow in tandem with the trend of digitalisation.  This has been a key challenge for many business leaders. According to recent research by recruitment agency Robert Half, almost all CFOs surveyed find it more challenging to source qualified professionals, and almost nine in 10 of CIOs find it more challenging to find skilled candidates – compared to five years ago.  Despite this ongoing war for talent, why is it that many job seekers say businesses seem slow with offering them a job when they were found to be suitable? More than seven in 10 job seekers in Singapore surveyed said they have taken a “second-choice” job offer because their preferred employer took too long to give them an answer, according to another survey commissioned by Robert Half.  Almost two-thirds also say they have waited longer than a month to hear back about a role for which they have interviewed, while four in 10 have waited longer than six weeks – and one in four say this duration was even longer for them – a whopping two months or more.  Merely 1 per cent got feedback on the same day.  LONG-DRAWN HIRING PROCESSES This is a disconcerning trend – that in the current tight labour market, many employers are unintentionally alienating potential workers with long drawn-out hiring processes. Job seekers with specialised skills are aware of the advantage they have in the employment market, so it is disturbing that many of Singapore’s skilled professionals are turning down their preferred jobs because of the time they spend waiting to hear back on their progress during the recruitment process. What’s causing the delay? Companies are being very cautious and want to be certain they are choosing the right person for the job to avoid a costly hiring mistake. But there are a few courses of action job seekers themselves can take to navigate delays in the recruitment process and motivate employers to come to a hiring decision more quickly. FIRST, FIND OUT THE NEXT STEPS BEFORE LEAVING THE INTERVIEW  Job applicants should not leave the interview until they have confirmation the hiring manager has all the information required and have clarified sufficiently on the next steps in the recruitment process.  This allows candidates to address any concerns the employer may have before they make their final decision.  Additionally, asking for clarifications on next steps can help set a clearer timeframe for when job seekers can expect to hear an update on their application.  SECOND, FOLLOW UP The best way for job applicants to remain top of mind with the hiring manager is by following up within 48 hours of the first interview.  For example, a thank you note can be a nice touch and could help applicants stand out by reaffirming their interest in the position.  Additionally, communication goes both ways – candidates who have not heard back from the hiring manager after a week should be proactive in following up by email or calling them.  In the event the employer has no update, candidates should ask about when they can expect to hear back and express their interest in the role once again. THIRD, MAKE IT CLEAR THE JOB SEARCH IS ONGOING One additional way for job seekers to potentially speed up the hiring process is to remind the hiring manager that they are still job hunting.  In the event they have received interest from and have been interviewing with other companies, candidates should inform the hiring manager as well. This helps set clear expectations to prospective employers, especially now they know they are not the only business competing for a candidate’s talent. Candidates need to take charge of the hiring process. This means doing their part in taking the necessary steps, being proactive in expressing their commitment and interest, as well as communicating openly with potential employers.  However, it is also important for them to remain patient during the recruitment process and remember that companies only want the best person for the job.  Equally, employers need to adjust their recruitment process to the expectations of today’s candidates if they want to reduce the risk of losing out on top talent.  While it may be time-consuming for hiring managers, businesses need to look towards streamlining their entire recruitment process, from initial outreach to final job offer, to strike the right balance for today’s job seekers.   Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard is managing director at Robert Half Singapore.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/how-long-recruiter-hiring-manager-gets-back-job-interview-10670690"}, {"datetime": "05 Sep 2018 11:54PM", "tags": ["HSR", "Kuala Lumpur", "Singapore", "Malaysia"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Over 100 specialists hired for KL-Singapore HSR project to be offered alternative jobs in LTA", "content": " SINGAPORE: A team of more than 100 specialists hired by Land Transport Authority's infrastructure arm to work on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail project will be offered alternative jobs within the government agency, SG HSR said on Wednesday (Sep 5).

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) clarified that the abortive costs of S$15 million, which Malaysia has to pay Singapore by January next year, pertain to the fees incurred by Singapore to suspend the HSR project. “These are costs that will be incurred by Singapore to pay contractors to terminate ongoing contracts and to wind down operations during the suspension period,” the ministry explained. “For example, some contracts include contract breakage costs, which need to be paid as a result of this suspension. “These are ‘abortive’ costs, as they are not useful for the HSR project after it resumes.”  The ministry added that these costs are different from the total cost incurred by the Singapore Government for the HSR Project, which had already exceeded S$250 million by the end of May.

The Singapore dollar rose to an intraday high of RM3.0183 before easing back to RM3.0161. This is the highest since the Singapore dollar touched RM3.0210 on Jan 5. The ringgit also fell lower against the US dollar at 4.1460 as traders shifted to safe-haven currencies on risk aversion in the foreign exchange market. Bank Islam Malaysia chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the weakening ringgit performance is primarily caused by external anomalies rather than domestic factors. “We have seen South Africa falling into recession, Argentina’s central bank raising its policy rate to 60 per cent last week and the ongoing trade tension instigated by the US. “All this has adversely affected market confidence and naturally, flight to quality happens,” he told Bernama. Dr Mohd Afzanizam said this would mean demand for safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar and yen would rise. By extension, he said the attractiveness of safe-haven currencies would weaken the emerging country currencies, including the ringgit. Meanwhile, Putra Business School senior lecturer and manager for Business Development Dr Ahmed Razman Abdul Latiff said one possible reason why the ringgit has been declining against US dollar was slower Malaysian export growth to the US this year. “The slower growth is due to tariff hikes imposed by the US since early this year and it is possible for the ringgit to go down further to RM4.20 per dollar by year-end,” he said. Meanwhile, Bank Negara Malaysia has maintained the Overnight Policy Rate at 3.25 per cent after a two-day Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. “The focus today was the MPC meeting and as expected Governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus did not rock the boat,” said Oanda’s head of trading Asia-Pacific Stephen Innes. “Traders are placing long dollar hedges and wait calmly for better days with the ringgit tracking towards RM4.15 per dollar,” he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-dollar-hits-8-month-high-against-malaysian-ringgit-10687754"}, {"datetime": "05 Sep 2018 09:31PM", "tags": ["Typhoon Jebi", "Japan"], "author": "", "title": "Singaporeans should defer travel to Osaka in aftermath of Typhoon Jebi: MFA", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singaporeans should defer non-essential travel to Osaka given the situation there in the wake of Typhoon Jebi, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Wednesday (Sep 5).

Chew Hup Seng went to Keat Hong Community Club in Choa Chu Kang on Jul 24 last year with his e-scooter. He took the lift to the fifth floor before mounting the e-scooter and riding it into the multi-purpose hall, the court heard. Mr Pedro JR Garcia Mondejar, a 48-year-old architectural coordinator in a construction firm engaged to conduct rectification works at the club, had politely asked Chew to stop riding the e-scooter around the hall, Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong told the court. Mr Mondejar was concerned that the timber flooring of the hall would be damaged. Chew was unhappy with Mr Mondejar and asked him who he was. When Mr Mondejar answered that he worked at the community club, Chew verbally abused him before riding off on his e-scooter. Mr Mondejar returned to his office, but the incident did not stop there. A while later, Mr Mondejar walked across the hall to the lift lobby, where Chew was riding his e-scooter along a narrow corridor. Chew could see Mr Mondejar clearly through a glass partition that separated the corridor and the hall, the prosecutor said. Right as Mr Mondejar was about to enter the lift lobby through the open glass door, Chew swerved his e-scooter towards him and collided with him. The incident was caught on closed-circuit television. Mr Mondejar was able to avoid getting hurt as he had blocked the e-scooter with his hands. Chew said: \"If you want, I bang you with my scooter.\" Chew continued to gesture aggressively at Mr Mondejar and followed him around the lift lobby, only leaving the place after Mr Mondejar went to the hall and locked the door behind him. CHEW WAS MOTIVATED BY ANIMOSITY TOWARDS VICTIM: PROSECUTION Chew pleaded guilty to one charge of acting rashly and endangering the personal safety of Mr Mondejar. Another charge of pointing his middle finger at Mr Mondejar and using abusive language was taken into consideration for sentencing. The prosecution asked for the maximum fine of S$2,500 to be imposed on Chew, saying that he had been riding his e-scooter at a location \"where he was clearly not allowed to do so\". Chew was \"motivated by animosity towards the victim\" and it was \"fortuitous that no injury was caused\", the prosecutor added, as he urged District Judge Olivia Low to consider the degree of rashness in the crime. Chew's defence lawyer countered, saying that the charge was under the personal safety limb and not under endangering human life. \"The degree of rashness is at the lower end, and not as high as the prosecution submits,\" he said. The judge agreed with the prosecution and gave Chew a S$2,500 fine, with two weeks' jail in default if he cannot pay the fine. She reminded him: \"Please do not reoffend again.\" The e-scooter was forfeited to the police for disposal. Chew could have been jailed for up to six months for his rash act.

At a news conference after the signing, Mr Azmin said Malaysia will have to pay Singapore S$15 million in abortive costs before the end of January 2019 for suspending the project. Additionally, if Malaysia does not proceed with the project by May 31, 2020, it will also bear the agreed costs incurred by Singapore in fulfilling the HSR Bilateral Agreement. The Singapore Government had spent more than S$250 million on the project by the end of May this year, said Mr Khaw in July. This included costs for consultancies to design the civil infrastructure, costs for dedicating manpower to oversee and deliver the project and costs for land acquisition. During the suspension period, both countries will \"continue to discuss the best way forward for the HSR project with the aim of reducing costs\", the joint statement said. \"We have all worked tirelessly in order to bring about a resolution that is mutually beneficial,\" said Mr Azmin after the signing ceremony.  \"Without doubt, this agreement would not have happened if not for our strong commitment to bilateral cooperation between our two countries,\" he added.  \"I am confident that this spirit will see us through the final fruition of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail project.\" Mr Khaw also spoke after signing the new agreement. \"Many Singaporeans had been looking forward to the realisation of this project and we remain committed to this project,\" he said, adding that he understood why Malaysia had to suspend the development of the HSR. The HSR is among several mega projects approved by the previous Malaysian government that have come under review, as the Pakatan Harapan administration relooks the country's finances after winning the May general election.  Dr Mahathir had announced shortly after the election that the HSR project would be scrapped entirely, saying that the rail will not benefit Malaysia. He later said in July that the project would be deferred instead. During Wednesday's news conference, Mr Azmin revealed that a flurry of negotiations led to the announcement. The Malaysian Cabinet initially asked for the project to be on hold for three to four years - a message he passed on when visiting Singapore, he said. Mr Khaw later met him in Kuala Lumpur and told him Singapore was willing to consider postponement of a year. The Malaysian minister returned to Singapore to appeal for it to be suspended for longer. Both sides agreed that if the deferment was beyond two years, the business model for the project would have changed by then, and \"costs would continue to escalate\". The two countries then mutually agreed on a two-year deferment.  Given the length of suspension, the Singapore and Malaysia companies managing the rail project - SG HSR and MyHSR - will be calling off the ongoing international joint tender for the HSR Assets Company (AssetsCo). AssetsCo was meant to be responsible for designing, building, financing and maintaining all rolling stock as well as rail assets such as power, signalling and telecommunications.  The proposed 350km-long HSR line aims to reduce travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to around 90 minutes by train, from the current 11 hours on existing train services. When operational, the line will offer an express service between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, a domestic service from Kuala Lumpur to Iskandar Puteri and a shuttle service from Iskandar Puteri to Jurong East.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/high-speed-rail-postponed-malaysia-singapore-agreement-10686032"}, {"datetime": "05 Sep 2018 01:41PM", "tags": ["Building and Construction Authority"], "author": "", "title": "BCA launches new programme, rating for Super Low Energy non-residential buildings", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) on Wednesday (Sep 5) launched the Super Low Energy (SLE) Programme in a bid to improve energy efficiency at non-residential buildings. Under the programme, BCA introduced a new benchmark to recognise buildings that have achieved either Super Low Energy or Zero Energy status.  The new Green Mark (GM) for SLE voluntary certification framework provides recognition in addition to Green Mark ratings.  For example, a building that achieves GM Platinum and GM SLE would be awarded Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy).  To achieve the Super Low Energy status, buildings need to achieve at least 60 per cent energy savings by adopting energy efficient measures and onsite renewable energy based on the 2005 building code level. To achieve the Zero Energy status, buildings are required to use onsite and off-site renewable energy to generate more than 100 per cent of energy needed for building operation. Public and private developers have agreed to strive for the GM SLE in close to 20 projects, BCA said in a media release.  The two buildings at Kranji and Seletar camps are on track to achieve Zero Energy Building status, BCA said.  The Defence Science and Technology Agency has worked with the Army to achieve a high standard of energy efficiency for building facilities in both camps, allowing the buildings to save close to 540 MWh of electricity a year, which is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of about 116 4-room Housing Board flats, BCA said.  The SLE programme was announced by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong at the opening of the Singapore Green Building Week and also consists of an SLE challenge to invite developers to take the lead in developing SLE buildings. So far, more than 10 developers and building owners have pledged their commitment to achieve at least one SLE project in the next five years, BCA said. “We have come a long way in our environmental sustainability journey,\"  said BCA CEO Hugh Lim. \"To kick-start the next wave of our green building movement, BCA is working with the industry professionals to deliver cost-effective Super Low Energy buildings which can achieve a minimum of 60 per cent energy efficiency improvement over the 2005 building codes, when the BCA Green Mark was first introduced. \"We are embarking on more rigorous research and innovation to further push the frontier for green buildings to achieve up to 80 per cent energy efficiency improvement.\" BCA has also worked with the industry and academia to develop a Technology Roadmap to chart the pathways towards SLE. Research findings from the Roadmap identified more than 60 potential solutions from enhanced existing technologies and emerging R&D innovations, BCA said. Keppel Land has committed to pilot various emerging technologies at its BCA GM Platinum certified development Keppel Bay Tower, BCA said.  In 2017, BCA worked with Keppel Land to launch a Joint Challenge Call for test-bedding of SLE technologies at Keppel Bay Tower.  The project, supported by an innovation fund of S$1.28 million from BCA’s Green Buildings Innovation Cluster programme, demonstrated technologies such as smart lighting system and air-conditioning based on indoor activity analytics.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/bca-launches-new-programme-rating-for-super-low-energy-non-10685436"}, {"datetime": "05 Sep 2018 01:36PM", "tags": ["Seah Kian Peng", "K Shanmugam", "Jolovan Wham", "Thum Ping Tjin", "Kirsten Han", "Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods"], "author": "", "title": "Activists send letter of complaint to PM Lee about Seah Kian Peng, Shanmugam", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three activists who were criticised by MP Seah Kian Peng and Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam over their meeting with Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad have sent a letter of complaint to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his capacity as secretary-general of the People's Action Party (PAP). The letter, signed by historian Thum Ping Tjin, journalist Kirsten Han and civil rights activist Jolovan Wham, was sent on Wednesday (Sep 5), according to a Facebook post by Ms Han. A similar copy of the letter was also sent to Mr Charles Chong, chairman of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods.  The letter comes after Mr Seah and Mr Shanmugam criticised the meeting between the group – which included political dissident Tan Wah Piow and graphic novelist Sonny Liew – and Dr Mahathir, where they invited the Malaysian prime minister to speak at a democracy conference. In a Facebook post after the meeting, Mr Seah said Dr Thum “does not wish Singapore well” and had invited Dr Mahathir to “bring democracy to Singapore”. Referring to a Facebook post by Dr Thum, which appeared to suggest that Singaporeans should celebrate Malaysia’s independence day, Mr Seah said Dr Thum had suggested Singapore is part of Malaya.  The activists’ letter disputed that Dr Thum had asked Dr Mahathir to bring democracy to Singapore or interfere in Singapore’s affairs. “Mr Seah has not provided any other substantiation for his claims,” they wrote. On the celebration of Malaysia’s independence day, the activists said: “Our first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew declared de facto independence on Aug 31, 1963, signifying the end of British colonial rule in Singapore. “It is a huge stretch to suggest that wishing Singaporeans a ‘happy unofficial independence day’ is tantamount to expressing an opinion that Singapore is a part of Malaysia today.” The activists claimed Mr Seah's comments have had the effect of inciting accusations of treason, and there have been calls for their arrests, detention and even deaths. They said the allegations have been amplified by the PAP's official Facebook page and by Mr Shanmugam, who like Mr Seah is a member of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods. “It is highly irresponsible for Mr Seah and Mr Shanmugam – members of the People’s Action Party in positions of power – to be making public allegations without adequate substantiation or evidence,” the activists wrote in their letter to Mr Lee. “As the leader of the People’s Action Party, we urge you to look into this issue, and take leadership in promoting responsible behaviour among members of your party.” In the letter to Mr Chong, the group said it was “ironic” that members of the Select Committee “are themselves making public allegations without adequate substantiation or evidence”. “This episode also emphasises points previously made that any solution or penalty we ultimately adopt to counter online falsehoods should also apply to the government, as states themselves can be a source of misinformation and disinformation.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/thum-pj-kirsten-han-letter-complaint-pm-lee-seah-kian-peng-10685952"}, {"datetime": "05 Sep 2018 12:11PM", "tags": ["HSR", "Malaysia", "transport", "Mahathir Mohamad", "Teo Chee Hean"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore, Malaysia to sign new agreement on high-speed rail link; project expected to be postponed", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: Singapore and Malaysia will ink an agreement on Wednesday (Sep 5) afternoon on the High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, with expectations that the development of the link will be postponed.

Official data released last month showed second-quarter GDP coming in at a slightly better-than-expected 3.9 per cent from a year ago.  Compared to the last survey in June, the outlook for some economic indicators has brightened.  For one, experts expect the manufacturing sector to remain a key driver of the economy, with full-year growth estimated to be 7.6 per cent – a significant upgrade from the previous survey’s 5.3 per cent.  This comes as the sector, which accounts for one fifth of the economy, beat expectations to grow 10.2 per cent in the second quarter.  “Manufacturing continues to surprise to the upside with external demand remaining pretty firm,” said Standard Chartered economist Jonathan Koh.  There was also more optimism when it comes to growth in accommodation and food services. The sector is tipped to grow 2.9 per cent for the full year, compared to 2.2 per cent in the previous poll.  The growth outlook for private consumption also got bumped up to 2.8 per cent from 2.2 per cent.  “Private consumption may help to contribute to growth given that the labour market has improved and we are seeing real wage growth picking up. That will help to support spending,” said Mr Koh.  On the other hand, economists maintained or downgraded their 2018 forecasts for indicators, such as finance and insurance, construction, wholesale and retail trade, and non-oil domestic exports.  Growth expectations for the construction sector saw the biggest downward revision, with economists forecasting a contraction of 4.2 per cent. The previous survey flagged a decline of 2.1 per cent.  CIMB Private Bank economist Song Seng Wun said: “Most of (the economists) started the year with cautious optimism based on public sector projects being brought forward and hopes for an acceleration in private sector works.”  “But so far, the numbers have proven to be weaker than expected,” he added. The construction sector contracted 4.6 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, according to official data.  Meanwhile, the MAS survey showed forecasts for both headline and core inflation in 2018 to be at 0.7 and 1.7 per cent, respectively.  On the labour front, economists expect the unemployment rate to be at 2.1 per cent at year-end, unchanged from the previous survey.  TRADE PROTECTIONISM AMONG KEY DOWNSIDE RISKS Among the 23 economists polled, trade protectionism remained as the biggest downside risk for Singapore’s economy.  It was cited by 89 per cent of respondents, ticking up from 84 per cent in the June survey, with further escalation of trade rhetoric by the US and its trading partners, as well as the implementation of announced tariffs, causing concern.  While the effects of tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China have not been reflected in broader economic data thus far, the risk of policy missteps has risen amid fears that trade tensions could be here to stay longer than expected, said Mr Song.  There were also growing worries about weaker external growth on the back of tightening liquidity conditions in emerging markets. This was flagged by 42 per cent of economists polled by MAS, a big jump from 11 per cent previously.  Meanwhile, the respondents that highlighted slower growth in China as a downside risk also increased to 37 per cent, from 21 per cent, on the back of tightening credit conditions.  “There are signs that China’s growth has started to soften and policymakers have begun moving to a more neutral stance,” said Mr Koh, referring to recent moves such as the Chinese central bank cutting reserve requirements for lenders.  “Given how China is a huge driver of exports in the region, any further slowdown will definitely impact growth,” he added. Economists have also become less optimistic about the domestic property market following the announcement of fresh cooling measures in early-July. Just 26 per cent of the economists surveyed cited it as a possible upside factor, compared to 47 per cent in the June survey.  Looking ahead to 2019, experts surveyed maintained their expectations for overall GDP growth to ease to 2.7 per cent.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-economy-growth-forecast-2018-mas-survey-10685342"}, {"datetime": "05 Sep 2018 06:42AM", "tags": ["SIA", "Singapore Airlines", "airlines", "travel", "branding"], "author": "Maneesh Sah", "title": "Commentary: Singapore Airlines' rebrand must not downplay the Singapore Girl", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) continues to do well in global surveys.  In July, it was named the world’s best airline in Skytrax’s 2018 World Airline Awards, almost right after it bagged the title of \"Best Airline in the World\" awarded by popular travel website TripAdvisor.  But the airline is not resting on past laurels. Instead, it recognises the need to do things differently – demonstrated as the company embarks on a major rebrand as it aims to transform itself in a highly competitive environment.  SIA has issued a request for information, inviting external agencies to pitch to provide an integrated marketing solution. It has sought a fresh take on how the SIA brand should be modernised, and for the creative agency best able to do that to manage its media, content, website and app.  BUILDING A SERVICE BRAND But in its rebranding exercise, SIA must not forget that top brands never start out with the intent of building a great brand. Instead, they focus on delivering a profitable product or service and an organisation that can sustain it.  Towards this end, SIA’s investments in the latest aircraft, technology and processes is a step in the right direction.   SIA has also always been cognisant that it needs quality people to differentiate its offering. From its humble beginnings, it has invested in cabin crew who can deliver high quality service. These combined puts SIA on a strong footing.  SIA’s rebrand coincides with rapidly expanding air links that are expected to fuel global connectivity and the war for talent in the airline industry.  The International Air Transport Association expects passengers to double to 7.8 billion in 2036. According to the Boeing Long-Term Market Forecast (2016 to 2035), the aviation industry will need to recruit more than 2 million employees.  The Asia-Pacific region will have the highest demand for aviation talent. The question is, will SIA be able to compete with emerging players for talent to support its growth? THE SINGAPORE GIRL  Let’s take a step back to see what has also made SIA so well-known around the world. Undoubtedly, the Singapore Girl, introduced by adman Ian Batey in 1972, is the most well-cited visual embodiment of SIA’s brand.  Some critics argue that the term Singapore Girl is sexist, outdated and reinforces stereotypes of subservient Asian women. Shouldn’t she take a back seat in the upcoming rebrand? Yet her success in being recognised by passengers who haven't even flown on SIA proves that she is the soul of the company. By being SIA’s personification of quality and its most visible face in its marketing campaigns, the Singapore Girl humanises its employer brand. She is a tangible representation of efficiency, warmth and the readiness to go the extra mile. She inspires SIA’s crew members, pilots, ground and support staff to put the customer first and be proud of being part of a top airline. So while the Singapore Girl is an icon of SIA’s customer-facing brand, her popularity strengthens its employee value proposition as well. DIFFERENTIATING EMPLOYEE VALUE PROPOSITION But a compelling employee value proposition goes well beyond company image, salary or even incentives. It includes learning and development opportunities.  Even though staff training is a key factor in the airline industry, SIA remains ahead of its peers with the strongest focus on this area. Its development programmes for newly recruited cabin crew are among the most comprehensive. The airline trains its fresh recruits for four months — twice as long as the industry average of eight weeks. Since SIA recognises that it’s in the business of selling experiences, its programmes cover not only safety and functional issues but also include courses on deportment, etiquette and cultural sensitivity. Cabin crew appreciate subtle issues, such as speaking at eye level rather than “talking down” to passengers. They also learn how to handle troublesome passengers diplomatically, and can manage inappropriate behaviour.  To pass, trainees must prove they can handle whatever comes their way with confidence. They can’t be flustered when things go wrong and are encouraged to think on their feet.  ATTRACTING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES While prospective cabin crew expect that a career with SIA will enable them to travel the world, they also know that they will be equipped with these soft skills — critical skills that will keep them in good stead for many years in an increasingly globalised world.  Indeed, there are many examples of cabin crew pursuing successful careers in customer relations, marketing and PR after they complete their contracts with SIA. This is the brand promise SIA’s prospective employees are buying into. Many educated bright young people from not only Singapore but Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, India and China apply to SIA due to this perceived value.  According to one news report, SIA’s cabin crew stay with the airline for more than 10 years and ground staff serve for more than 19 years. SIA has also featured in Randstad’s annual ranking of most attractive employers in Singapore for many years. But SIA must do more to transform its employee experience, as it invests in delivering a superior customer experience. Last year, its staff complained that the airline’s appraisal system discourages those who are genuinely ill from resting at home. Since then, SIA has announced it will no longer dock its cabin crew’s points when they take medical leave for common ailments such as cough and cold. SIA must continue to engage its employees and enhance its employer brand. It must invest in continuous dialogue by combining data, analytics and digital technology to create feedback loops that drive self-sustaining improvement, enabling its talent to maximise their potential. According to Aon research, a 5 per cent increase in employee engagement is linked to a 3 per cent increase in revenue growth in the subsequent year. Back to why it’s important to maintain the Singapore Girl in SIA’s rebranding. To be successful in the long term, a company’s employer brand needs to be in alignment with its customer-facing brand. The gracious Singapore Girl does a great job of achieving this for SIA in the minds of its customers and employees.  By attracting and engaging high quality talent, the Singapore Girl is well positioned to not only wow existing customers but woo new ones as well. As SIA goes for a rebrand, it will do well not to ignore her.

The 6.9-magnitude earthquake had struck in the night, destroying homes and the picture of an idyllic paradise. Now, the first boats were setting out bringing the injured off the remote island to safety, and panicked holidaymakers were doing everything they could to get on the few available vessels. “It was absolutely frantic. Imagine a beach filled with people with backpacks freaking out. Everyone wanted out,” said Singaporean Ms Tay Suyi, 26. “As people were carrying the injured, some would jump in and pretend to carry them so that they could get on the boat.  It was insane. But, while many fled, a group of foreigners including Ms Tay risked their own safety and stayed behind to help. Following the devastating quake of Aug 5, which left more than 500 dead and thousands injured on the larger nearby island of Lombok, staff of Gili Trawangan’s various dive operations stepped into the role of impromptu rescuers, lifesavers, rubble clearers and fixer-uppers for days after. They refused to get on the last boat out that the Indonesian authorities could guarantee them, despite the threat of further tremors. “The reason you have a business here is because you love the island - and you want to see it come back to the way it was,” said Ms Tay, speaking to CNA Insider. “For me, it’s one of those places where it’s home, you know. You don’t leave home if shit goes down.” IGNORING THE TSUNAMI WARNING With its pristine turquoise water, soft white sand beaches and waters teeming with biodiversity, Gili Trawangan was perfect for Ms Tay, a professional dive instructor who had been working there for six months. The largest of the three Gili islands, it is small enough to walk around in an hour and a half. There are no cars, buses or motorbikes, only bicycles and horse-drawn carts; and with many visitors heading here for the diving, there are over two dozen dive shops. At around 7.30pm on the cloudless night of Aug 5, Ms Tay had just gotten home from work and had put on some loud music. “And then, I thought the music got louder. I looked around, and everything was shaking.” Earthquake, she realised. She’d felt tremors on the island before, the most recent fortnight ago, but nothing of this magnitude. Walls crumbled; glass shattered.  “It couldn’t be more than seven seconds, but after three seconds, all the power shut off on the whole island. It was pitch black.” She ran outside. “I remember sitting there, and thinking the stars were very pretty…  and then there were locals and tourists running by, crying. You could hear screaming everywhere.\" People were yelling about a possible tsunami, and rushing for the safety of the hills. But Ms Tay’s instinct was to head in a different direction: The dive shops at the harbour where she works, to check on her friends. “I was terrified, I was alone. The first thing I wanted was to make sure that everyone was okay,” she said. “I figured that there would be some people around who needed help.  Sitting on a hill wasn’t going to do anything. At the dive shop, she grabbed a friend and began patrolling the streets to assess the damage and look out for the injured. “You know that when you stop, you’d just panic. So I just needed to do stuff.” They found familiar village roads blocked off by the rubble of collapsed buildings. “A big mosque that was right in the centre of the island had just dropped completely,” she recalled. “You look at the hotels, hostels and places you know where people were – they were gone, it was crazy.” TRYING TO SAVE LIVES At the main harbour, a makeshift medical centre had been set up. There would be no boats until morning. So for those critical next few hours of darkness, it was all up to the few doctors and nurses – both locals and foreigners on holiday – and dive instructors, who were all trained in Emergency First Response (EFR), to treat the injured and try to keep the severely wounded alive. “By the time we got there, there were about 15 injured lying on the sunbeds and sunchairs,” said Ms Tay, whose EFR training kicked in as she set about helping to bandaging those who were bleeding, setting up drips, and fetching supplies for the medical personnel. “Every dive shop has medical supplies, so we brought it all there – oxygen kits, bandages, stuff like that.” They worked overnight. Most of the wounded were locals, probably because their houses were less stable, Ms Tay guessed. The team couldn’t save everyone. “We lost two during the night.  One of the guys I remember because I was doing CPR on him when he passed. The lower half of his body had been completely crushed. “We were just trying to keep everyone stable, you know, until they could get to the hospital in Lombok. We couldn't get any boats out, we were waiting for the boats to come.” During the night, people kept coming in and asking “what can I do?” A core group that included a divemaster trainee and a dive instructor took to delegating tasks, while one local girl acted as the sole translator. “It’s amazing how people band together when something’s wrong,” said Ms Tay. “What was cool was that every dive instructor was trained in EFR, so the island was filled with people who knew what to do.” FINDING A WAY OFF Sunrise brought a flood of people looking for a way off the island. “At about 6am they started pouring down to the harbour,” said Ms Tay. “Then we had to build a makeshift morgue, because there were tourists sitting next to dead bodies.” A number of boats had been scheduled to arrive from Lombok in the morning. But given the devastation over on the bigger island, they didn’t appear. In the north of Lombok, the earthquake’s epicentre, thousands of buildings had collapsed and most of the region was in ruins.  The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency later said that one of the difficulties they faced on Aug 5 was having to evacuate more than 8,000 people from the three Gili islands that same day. (For more on Lombok’s crisis, catch Insight: Earthquake in Paradise on Sept 6 at 8pm SG/HK.) Meanwhile back on Gili Trawangan, dive shops were doing what they could to get people a ride, including locals who were desperate to find loved ones living on Lombok. “Everyone who had a connection to a boat was calling… we had private fast boats, we had slow boats, just any boat really,” said Ms Tay. “We formed a human chain and built a ramp sort of thing with bricks to get the injured on the boats. There were a lot of spinal injuries, perforated fractures, that needed serious medical attention and there was nothing we could do on a beach, you know.” They eventually sent them off – after having to physically hold back able-bodied, panicked tourists who wanted to get on the first few boats. “Then I slept for 13 hours straight,” said Ms Tay. CLEANING UP AFTERWARDS By day 3 the exodus had petered out. Some 30 foreigners, including dive professionals, stayed behind to help with the aftermath, along with the locals. According to Ms Tay, one government official told them that one last evacuation boat was leaving, and warned that if they stayed, there would be no supplies of food or water coming in (the island ships in most of its essentials). But the group wasn’t too worried as businesses had been preparing for the high tourist season with ample stocks of food and drinks. “Everyone was bringing stuff in from their houses, their shops, their restaurants. Everyone was just being really generous, and it was really nice to see that,” she said. One dive shop with its own generator welcomed the volunteers to stay in its facilities. The group decided to divide up the work that needed to be done. “The 30 of us gathered and we said, okay, who’s good at what?” They formed teams to deal with plumbing issues, electricity supply, fixing things, and hygiene. As part of the hygiene squad, Ms Tay and friends went around to every restaurant and empty home to clear away rotting food, to prevent pests like rats, cockroaches and maggots. “Everyone was being really positive, we played music and made a game of it,” she said. The group also set about making sure buildings that remained standing were safe, and took their sledgehammers to demolish any structures that weren’t. The rubble was cleared with horse-carts and wheelbarrows. WATCH: Fear and determination in the quake's aftermath (3:51)  Ms Tay said that just before she left for Singapore nearly two weeks ago to renew her visa, security forces had stepped in with heavy machinery to clear the debris, and they are slowly helping to rebuild the place.  MOVING AHEAD? People have also been returning to Gili Trawangan, including some of Ms Tay’s dive friends who had earlier ended up in Bali coordinating relief efforts with non-governmental groups to get supplies to Lombok. Ms Tay recalled: “On the fifth day after the earthquake, we had two tourists arrive on the island. We were like ‘what? How did you even get here?’ They just wanted to see the island, like a weird ‘dark tourism’ thing.” But the fact that visitors are returning is encouraging. “The more people come back, the quicker they do, the quicker we can rebuild and bring things back to how it was,” said the Singaporean, who has since returned to work on the island. She noted that the island should be back up and running by this month, and that some restaurants and dive shops have already reopened. The future could remain an uncertain one for tourism in Lombok and the Gili islands. On Aug 31, a 4.8-magnitude quake hit Lombok, yet another of a series that have hammered the region. Four quakes in the span of three weeks have measured greater than 6.0 in magnitude – an unusual pattern which seismologists say is significant. For now, the denizens of Gili Trawangan can depend on their community spirit to pull together and rebuild. “No one is being paid to do any of this… they’re doing so much there just to get the island back to normal,” said Ms Tay. “It shows you the good in people.” Catch the Insight episode about the earthquake In Lombok and its aftermath, in ‘Earthquake in Paradise’, on Sept 6 at 8pm SG/HK.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/gili-lombok-earthquake-singaporean-dive-instructor-10684362"}, {"datetime": "04 Sep 2018 10:29PM", "tags": ["OCBC Bank"], "author": "", "title": "OCBC service disruption due to software failure, says bank", "content": " SINGAPORE: OCBC Bank said on Tuesday (Sep 4) that a software failure caused the service disruption that happened on Saturday night.   The disruption, which started from 8.45pm that night, affected all of OCBC's banking channels, including its ATMs, credit card transactions, as well as mobile and online banking services.  OCBC Group CEO Samuel Tsien said in a statement on Tuesday that the bank had identified the root cause of the disruption.  \"A software failure in the backup unit for the core banking system resulted in the customer transaction data not being successfully transferred.

Hsieh Teng-Chia, 31, and Chen You-Jeng, 34, had helped to collect and transfer the money.  The victims, who included retirees and housewives, were tricked into providing login credentials to their Singapore bank accounts, after believing that their accounts were implicated in money laundering cases. The two Taiwanese men met over drinks in Taiwan early last year, where You-Jeng recruited Hsieh to act as a middle-man in Singapore. He was to collect and hand over the money to another person. Hsieh was promised NTD75,000 (S$3,300) for a month's work, while You-Jeng had been offered NTD59,500 (S$2,650) for recruiting Hsieh. The pair arrived in Singapore in July 2017 and met up with another accomplice, 35-year-old Chen Peng-Yu, who was to give them instructions over messaging app Telegram. Hsieh collected money left by victims at various locations, transferring a total of S$185,000. Of this amount, You-Jeng delivered S$90,000 to another person as directed by Chen. MONEY WAS NOT RECOVERED The victims had received phone calls in June and July last year from people claiming to be police officers. These scammers convinced the victims that they were involved in money laundering cases or other serious offences, saying that their bank accounts or cards were implicated in the crimes. Believing that they would face prosecution, some of the victims gave their bank account details while others were pressured into withdrawing money from other victims and transferring the money to the syndicate members.

The change in speed limit is part of a list of recommendations made by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel, which the Government accepted on Tuesday (Sep 4). If you cycle or ride an e-scooter or other PMDs, here are the 5 things you need to know: If you are riding your PMDs or bicycles on footpaths, your speed limit will be 10kmh, down from 15kmh currently. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) said the lower speed limit will give PMD users, cyclists and pedestrians enough time to react to each other in unforeseen circumstances. A maximum device speed of 10kmh will also be imposed on motorised wheelchairs and mobility scooters in order to prevent retailers and able-bodied users from abusing such devices to circumvent the regulations. All active mobility device users must wear helmets when riding on roads. But if you are cycling on a footpath, cycling path or shared path, and part of your journey requires you to cross the road or be temporarily on the road to avoid an obstruction, you do not need a helmet. Although not compulsory, MOT “strongly advises” PMD users to wear helmets when travelling on paths.  PMD users are not allowed to ride on roads or expressways. In January, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced stiffer penalties for PMD users who ride on local and major roads. Cyclists and active mobility device users must stop and look out for vehicles at road crossings before resuming their journeys. This will reduce the risk of accidents by providing these users and motorists with more reaction time.

Only in May 2017 did Ms Sushma realise there was money missing from her account and that there were records of numerous transactions that she had not performed. She then lodged a police report. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran asked for a sentence of seven months, saying that Sharifah was persistent in her criminal conduct.

Starting early 2019, the current 15kmh speed limit on footpaths for PMDs and bicycles will be brought down to 10kmh. The lower speed will give PMD users, cyclists and pedestrians enough time to react to each other in unforeseen circumstances, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Tuesday (Sep 4). “All riders must continue to give way to pedestrians and slow down when approaching crowded areas or blind spots. Riders should also exercise caution when overtaking other path users,” the ministry said in a press release. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel submitted six recommendations, including the lowering of speed limits on footpaths, to the Minister for Transport on Aug 24. All six have been accepted and will be implemented in early 2019. A maximum device speed of 10kmh will also be imposed on motorised wheelchairs and mobility scooters. This will prevent retailers and able-bodied users from using such devices to circumvent the regulations, MOT said. Cyclists will also be required to wear helmets when travelling on roads. The rule will not apply to those who are crossing the road as part of their journey on footpaths and cycling or shared paths. PMD users, on the other hand, are not allowed to ride on roads but the ministry said those travelling on paths are \"strongly advised\" to put on helmets. At road crossings, cyclists and PMD users must stop and look out for vehicles, before resuming their journeys. “This will provide active mobility device users and motorists with more reaction time, thereby reducing the risk of accidents. Likewise, motorists should also play their part by slowing down at crossings and looking out for cyclists, PMD users and pedestrians,” MOT said. The ministry also accepted the panel’s recommendation not to make third-party liability insurance mandatory, and to instead place greater focus on the prevention of accidents. However, it said it strongly encourages users to take up insurance, in particular by food delivery companies for their employees. It also plans to raise awareness of and accessibility to existing avenues of seeking compensation, such as by working with the Singapore Mediation Centre. “In accepting these recommendations, the ministry agrees with the panel that the safety of all active mobility riders and public path users is paramount,” MOT said, adding that it will monitor the situation to assess if the regulations should be further refined. “We will continue to strengthen our public education efforts on the safe sharing of paths and roads. We hope that all these measures will help to create a safe riding culture in Singapore.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/e-scooters-bicycles-speed-limit-footpaths-cut-to-10kmh-pmd-10682204"}, {"datetime": "04 Sep 2018 09:15AM", "tags": ["HDB", "property", "Woodlands"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "HDB introduces town design guides aimed at fostering residents' 'sense of belonging'", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Tuesday (Sep 4) announced it will progressively roll out over the next five years 24 “design guides” for each of its towns, beginning with Woodlands in the north. Each guide will be a unique, comprehensive document broken down into three different levels - town, neighbourhood and precinct. It will provide a common reference point for different agencies, town councils and design consultants as they implement both new developments as well as rejuvenation projects for the town throughout its life cycle, said HDB in a press release. “With different agencies and the town councils carrying out regular enhancements and improvements throughout the life cycle of the town, it is important to align all the different agencies’ efforts and ensure a coherent design and town identity,” said HDB’s chief executive officer Cheong Koon Hean. “In this way, we continue to strengthen the identity of each town, preserve the distinctive local flavour, and deepen the sense of belonging among residents to their home.” HDB said Woodlands was selected first to illustrate how the design guides can be applied to an existing town which is undergoing rejuvenation. “The name (Woodlands) originated from the many Keranji trees that dotted the coastline, which when viewed from the Johor side of the Straits, gave the area a heavily wooded appearance,” HDB explained. “When planning for Woodlands began in 1966, a ‘wooded’ theme was chosen for the town, to reflect its history and the gentle undulating terrain of the area.” As an example of how this historical identity will be preserved during town planning, HDB pointed to the upcoming WoodsVista Gallery, a 1.9 kilometre-long community link “set amidst lush greenery, allowing residents to walk, jog or cycle seamlessly from the Woodlands MRT station to the Woodlands Waterfront”. This “wooded” theme is further divided into five sub-themes at the neighbourhood level. For instance, HDB explained, Woodlands Central’s facade designs will have a suggested palette of light greys with contemporary accents of deeper greys and browns, in keeping with an “urban” sub-theme.  At the precinct level, playgrounds in the same area can be designed with the use of bright colours and sculptural elements to bring out a \"bold and vibrant character\". “As the designs of public housing evolve, more attention will be paid to infusing character and identity into the towns,” said HDB. “The introduction of a town design guide for each town marks a key milestone in our journey towards well-designed, sustainable and community-centric towns. “Going forward, HDB will continue to seek out new planning concepts and design ideas to create towns with strong identities to foster a strong sense of place and belonging for Singaporeans.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-town-design-guides-woodlands-10681988"}, {"datetime": "04 Sep 2018 09:15AM", "tags": ["HDB", "property", "Tengah"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Farm features to be part of first HDB homes in new Tengah town", "content": " SINGAPORE: The first district in Tengah to be launched by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will reflect the agricultural roots of the area, with community gardens and farming features. The Plantation District will cover about 90 hectares in the southern part of Tengah, and will have about 10,000 new homes when fully completed, HDB said on Tuesday (Sep 4). Among the features will be a 700-metre by 40-metre of strip of land called the Plantation Farmway. This will weave through housing precincts, serving as a green connector to link residents to other key facilities such as the town centre. Void decks will be oriented to face the greenery. The Farmway will include about 2,000 sq m of space for community gardening and farming. HDB said there is potential for a farmers’ market for residents to sell their own produce. Playgrounds will be built with designs inspired by fruit and vegetables, in line with the overall plantation theme. Two green pockets, each about 1,100 sq m, will be located within the Plantation Farmway as spaces for residents to relax under the shade of trees. In addition, an open green space with a small stage will be situated adjacent to the Farmway as an extended area for community events. Water features in the district will also be developed to attract birds, butterflies and dragonflies, which will help control the mosquito population. TWO MRT STATIONS, CYCLE PATHS To help realise the vision of making Tengah a \"car-lite\" town, two MRT stations along the future Jurong Region Line will be developed in the Plantation district, connecting residents to Jurong East, Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay. More MRT stations for the rest of the town are planned. Furthermore, most bus stops will be 300m or less from homes. To make it easier for residents to cycle, all roads in the district will feature cycling paths that are 2m wide. Tengah will also be the first HDB town to be planned with smart technologies town-wide from the outset. Across the whole of Tengah town, there will be features such as smart lighting and systems to collect rainwater for irrigation and to wash common areas. Such initiatives will help save energy and water. Additional power points and data points will also be installed in homes to enable the adoption of smart home devices. The first housing parcel in Plantation District is expected to comprise more than 1,500 flats ranging from two-room Flexi flats to 3-Gen flats.

Buoyed by generous incentives dished out by firms, drivers cashed in on the lucrative business, where earning a decent wage was a relative breeze. “It was … easy money (then),” said Mr Syahmi, 25. For many drivers like him, however, the tide has since turned: Dogged by meagre incentives and fares in recent months, those bolting for the exit have found themselves in a quandary, as they struggle to land jobs after years in the driver’s seat. And they cannot say they had not been warned. It was not too long ago that observers and experts cautioned that providing a private-hire car service could harm drivers’ job prospects. It did not add to their resumes and offered little in the way of skills-building, they had said. But few were prepared to listen then, as ride-hailing firms such as Grab and Uber grew rapidly in Singapore after muscling into the point-to-point transport sector in 2013, and turning the industry on its head. These fears are now being lived out by drivers, as some — seeking a way out for months — have been met with nothing but rejections. Since Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s regional operations in March, Mr Syahmi has fired off no fewer than 50 job applications. The polytechnic graduate, who has a diploma in outdoor and adventure learning, went after openings in areas ranging from customer service to hospital patient service. He was called up for four interviews, but has yet to bag a job offer. The soft-spoken young man cited a depleting wage, and concerns over advancement as the main reasons he is searching for greener pastures. “At my age, I should be doing other jobs for stability and (better) prospects,” he said. IN THE SAME BOAT There are many existing or former private-hire car drivers in a similar predicament, including the thousands who recently left the industry following the new licensing regime. In July, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said nearly half of the private-hire car drivers — 20,900 out of 42,900 — who received a one-year concession to attend a course and pass a test to obtain their vocational licence failed or did not attempt the test. Those who received the licence numbered 22,000. Drivers who applied for the Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence (PDVL) before July last year had to undergo the course and pass the test by Jun 30 this year to continue offering the service. The licence was introduced last year to ensure that drivers had the requisite skills to provide the service safely. The Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), one of the test centres for the PDVL, has also been helping drivers without a licence find jobs. Its spokesperson said drivers are still employable in other sectors, but noted that those who have provided chauffeured services for the past two or three years “may not be familiar with the current employment landscape or know how to go about seeking new employment”. “As such, they will need time and effort to transit into full employment, and therefore, we are helping with these interventions,” the spokesperson added. The institute did not provide figures for drivers who have approached it for such help, nor did it specify how many drivers had been matched to jobs. INCOMES HIT, POOR ADVANCEMENT In the wake of the Grab-Uber deal, many drivers cried foul as their incomes took a battering after Grab slashed its drivers’ incentives, which until then served as a considerable boost to their earnings. Drivers were hit in the pocket, as they reported lower earnings even after investing longer hours on the road each day. For Grab driver Edmund Chua, 60, driving for at least 10 hours a day now nets him up to S$2,000 monthly. By contrast, in 2015, drivers who hit the roads for less than eight daily could earn S$2,500 quite easily with incentives, he said. As recently as last year, drivers could snag weekly incentives of at least S$500 for completing a certain number of trips. Grab has since cut these to S$150, drivers said. Mr Chua, a former contract teacher in secondary schools, said he plans to return to adjunct teaching, “in case I cannot drive anymore because I can be tired”. “If private-hire drivers lose their jobs, they need to have a plan B. I don’t think this will be sustainable as a profession,” said the father of two daughters aged 13 and 15. But the anxieties faced by drivers go beyond plummeting incomes. The lack of career prospects also weighs on the minds of some. “When you drive for too long, maybe people think that you only can drive and you don’t have a lot of skills,” said Mr Syahmi, whose flurry of job applications were sent via various online portals, including Monster and JobStreet. Nevertheless, he said driving has taught him soft skills, such as controlling his emotions when dealing with irate or demanding passengers.  “We tend to be more patient or calm … skills that are quite important if we want to work in the customer-service line,” said Mr Syahmi, who added that he would leave straight away if a job offer lands. Another driver, who wanted to be known only as Mr Sim, 38, stopped driving for Grab in June. His “long-term prospects” were the main consideration, he said, so he jumped at an opportunity in logistics operations when it emerged. “Based on my age, I feel that driving can be something (I could do) towards retirement. It’s not a job I look forward to doing until the end of (my) days,” Mr Sim said. The prospects for drivers, he added, were not as good as before and the dearth of benefits — such as contributions to the Central Provident Fund savings scheme — was a drawback. For others, like Ms Vanessa Tiffany, 43, driving is not their only source of income. Apart from running a children’s events company, she is a relief teacher at a playgroup. She cautioned drivers against relying on full-time driving as their rice bowl.  “You’re not (going to) get anything. (You’ve to spend) 18 hours on the road every day to get S$4,000-plus (each month). In the end, you’ll fall sick,” the mother of three said. Asked how the company was dealing with drivers’ concerns over reduced incentives and earnings, Grab Singapore head of transport Andrew Chan said its focus was to keep its drivers’ operating costs low, and to support them and their families. Mr Chan noted that Grab was expanding its Better 365 programme, which improves drivers’ experience and welfare. Apart from fuel discounts and free personal accident insurance coverage, Grab recently introduced a three-day rental subsidy for top drivers when they take time off from driving, said Mr Chan. Other initiatives include discounts for medical services for drivers and their families, and education bursaries for their children. “While the freelance nature of the gig economy often results in higher turnover rates than other industries, we continue to find more ways and opportunities to maximise our driver-partners’ earnings through better technology, more ancillary revenue streams through GrabAds, and Better 365,” Mr Chan said.  “This model is more sustainable and improves overall income in the long run for our driver-partners.” It is understood that Grab also has a partnership with government agency SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), under which workshops are conducted to help drivers identify their skills-upgrading needs and how they can better tap the resources available. There is also a set of training courses curated for drivers. Meanwhile, home-grown ride-hailing service Ryde said its drivers’ earnings have been “healthy”. They earn an average full-time income of S$5,500 monthly, after deducting commission fees, its spokesperson said. Ryde takes a 10 per cent cut from its private-hire car drivers, lower than the 20 per cent commission Grab levies on its drivers. ALTERNATIVES: FOOD DELIVERY, CHAUFFEURING VISITORS While many drivers are looking to get out of the ride-hailing industry, some have found other ways to make ends meet. These include taking on bookings from tourists — mostly from China — and chauffeuring them to and from the airport as well as between major tourist sites. Others have switched to become delivery-partners under Grab’s food-delivery service GrabFood, for example. Mr Ong Boon Piew, 56, who has failed at least 10 attempts at the PDVL test, said he was left with no choice but to become a GrabFood delivery-partner. Armed with a motorcyclist’s licence, Mr Ong bought a motorcycle of more than 10 years from a friend in July for about S$3,000. The former lorry crane driver said food delivery was less stressful than driving a private-hire car, as he did not have to pay rental. Right now, he clocks between eight and 10 hours a day, receiving about two assignments every hour. On good months, he can earn more than S$3,000. He acknowledged, however, that he could earn more as a private-hire car driver, although this entailed clocking longer hours on the road. Mr Ong said he will reapply for a Taxi Driver’s Vocational Licence, which allows licensees to drive both taxis and private-hire cars. But for the moment, he said in Mandarin:  I have no choice. Without the option of (private-hire car driving), I’ve to find another job as a substitute. GrabFood crew can deliver food on bicycles, motorcycles, personal mobility devices including electric scooters, and even on foot. Those who wish to use cars must ensure that they are not using a private-hire chauffeured motor car or station wagon, Grab said. Under the LTA’s regulations, taxis and private-hire cars are meant to carry passengers for hire and reward, and cannot be used for the conveyance of goods for reward. Drivers accepting such jobs may have their vocational licences revoked, said an LTA spokesperson. The spokesperson added that owners who use their private vehicles to carry out a business for the transportation of goods must ensure that their vehicles have appropriate insurance cover for such additional uses. Grab’s spokesperson said last month that it has helped the majority of its drivers who did not obtain their PDVL by Jun 30 and were keen to explore other career options. This included converting them to GrabFood delivery-partners and referring them to e2i. “For those who wish to retake their PDVL, Grab continues to support these drivers with their reapplication process and provides free revision classes to help them better prepare for the exams,” added the spokesperson. Meanwhile, drivers such as Mr Chris Koh, 51, are devoting the bulk of their time to fulfilling bookings from tourists largely from China. For them, Grab rides have been relegated to a secondary source of income. These drivers shuttle tourists between the airport and their hotels, or to tourist attractions, such as the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay and the National Gallery Singapore. Linking up with riders via China-based applications such as Hi Guides and Yun Di Jie, drivers said that at peak travel seasons, such as during China’s recent summer school holidays, they earned nearly twice as much as what they drew from Grab rides. Prices are fixed by the apps, where users can choose from a range of car types, said Mr Koh, who began taking on these bookings about a year ago and knows of 80 to 100 drivers doing the same. Drivers in five-seat cars earn S$30 to S$35 for a journey from the airport to downtown Singapore, compared with about half (S$18) on Grab, before deducting commission fees, he said. Mr Koh has cut down on Grab bookings significantly, doing just 20 rides a week now, compared with 80 to 120 trips previously. He also gets more satisfaction from interacting with the tourists. “We get to know people from overseas, mainly … from different parts of China. We’re like ambassadors (of Singapore) as well,” he said. Mr Koh said it was “optional” for drivers to show their guests around the attractions and they do not get paid for this, recognising that tourist guides must hold a licence granted by the authorities. Another driver, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim, 50, said he gets at least four such chauffeured bookings daily, including airport transfers and trips to take in the sights. He also takes on limousine services for business guests.  Apart from China, his customers are from Korea, Japan, Russia, the United States and the Middle East, among other places. Ms Ong Ling Lee, the Singapore Tourism Board’s director of travel agents and tourist guides, said that the agency monitors such practices and has contacted some platforms to tell them about Singapore’s legislation on guiding services, where necessary. Ferrying tourists does not constitute guiding, said Ms Ong, but she added that individuals must hold a valid tourist-guide licence if they provide guiding services to one or more tourists for remuneration. Mr Koh said that he was mulling over taking up a tourist-guide licence in the longer run. However, juggling the course, which lasts about half a year, with his driving commitments would be cumbersome, he said. HELP AVAILABLE Members of Parliament (MPs) from the labour movement urged drivers to gain new skills even while on the job, so as to prepare themselves for other jobs should the need arise. Mr Desmond Choo, an assistant secretary-general with the National Trades Union Congress, acknowledged that re-skilling and re-training can be difficult at times for many of these drivers, especially those who are older. But he urged them to seek help from the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA), which can work with organisations such as e2i to help workers gain new skills under the Government’s Adapt and Grow employment-support initiative. For instance, the Place-and-Train Professional Conversion Programmes, where workers are hired by employers and trained to take on new jobs, will allow drivers to make the transition, said Mr Choo, an MP for Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC). “This process will take some time, so it’s important that the workers have to start this journey earlier,” he added. Mr Choo said that through the relevant agencies, drivers can also be matched to industries for which they have more “transferable skills”, such as the automotive sector as driving instructors or the public transport industry as bus drivers. It is also key for younger drivers to avail themselves of career-planning resources such as the NTUC’s Youth Career Network, which helps workers keep in step with industry trends and skills in demand. With better career planning, they are able to see other career opportunities rather than just driving for Grab. There is also a need to help drivers gain transferable skills, said Mr Choo. In this regard, modular, bite-sized training — conducted online, for instance — that could count towards a diploma or certificate will become increasingly important. “While they may not be able to go to classes full-time, they can learn during their free time and then (attend) a few days of classes and … over a certain period of time, they can get a certificate,” he said. “This must be the new direction.” Besides help from e2i and government agencies SSG and Workforce Singapore, Mr Ang Hin Kee, executive adviser to the NPHVA and the National Taxi Association, said that both associations have asked and will continue to call on the LTA to allow private-hire car and taxi drivers to be allowed to deliver parcels, in order to “monetise their time”. At TransportSG, a division of e2i, drivers are coached on job opportunities and the employment landscape. Employability coaches can also guide them to pick up new skills. e2i’s spokesperson said drivers stand a much higher chance of landing a job through job matching or career fairs if they are “job-ready”. In July, the institute had 14 employers engage drivers who were seeking other driving-related positions, for instance. It also designed a new Career Trial-cum-Place and Train Programme to help drivers without the PDVL find jobs. Under the Career Trial, drivers will be placed for a month with employers, who are encouraged to recruit them as full-time staff members at the end of the stint with a wage support scheme. The programme is not confined to certain industries or job types, although driving-related positions are among the options. “We will assess the applicants’ transferable skillsets and work with them to match job positions according to their best fit,” said the e2i spokesperson. Mr Choo said the gig economy is a permanent and growing part of the workforce not just in Singapore but globally, as app-based work becomes more common. “It’s not a bad thing … because it does allow people to transit to industries to find new sources of income more flexibly,” he added, though concerns remain over how to better protect such self-employed workers and ensure their long-term financial security. Agreeing, Mr Ang reiterated that disruptive technologies will create new job opportunities for workers, but also disrupt existing ones. “As a global phenomenon, we are better off finding a way to manage it than to reject it,” said the MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC. As for Mr Syahmi, he recognises the benefits of picking up new skills as he looks for a new job. He said:  We’re quite used to being our own boss… (but) we can’t be drivers our whole life He is thinking of learning another language, such as Mandarin, which will come in handy for jobs in customer service, for example. However, he will not be approaching e2i for help for now, as he would like to secure a job on his own. “I just want to discover where I should go myself,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/private-hire-drivers-face-roadblocks-reskilling-retraining-jobs-10678820"}, {"datetime": "04 Sep 2018 06:40AM", "tags": ["NRIC", "PDPC", "data privacy"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Collection of NRIC details: Security, building management providers grapple with costs, time needed to change", "content": " SINGAPORE: The costs of changing their IT systems to stop capturing people’s full NRIC number for verification as well as the time needed to do so are the challenges security and building management service providers will face, according to industry stakeholders. Their response comes after the Personal Data Privacy Commission (PDPC) announced that organisations will have to stop the unnecessary and indiscriminate collection of people’s NRIC numbers from September 2019. In an email response to Channel NewsAsia, the Association of Property and Facility Managers (APFM) said it is “supportive” of the latest guidelines as the new measures will “provide added protection, minimise incidents of identity theft and give holders of NRICs a better peace of mind”. The spokesperson added that while it does not see “any major challenges”, it noted the recording of only partial NRIC data will require software tweaks and time to deploy the new systems. “Nevertheless, our members are pleased that PDPC and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) will be publishing the technical guidelines and template notices as well as identifying pre-approved technology solutions to adopt,” the spokesperson said. Shedding more light on the concerns, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas, president of Security Association Singapore, said agencies that have already implemented visitor management systems that read and record full NRIC numbers at their buildings will now have to have the systems tweaked to capture just the last three digits and letter. Additional costs would be incurred while vendors of these systems would require time to make system changes, he added. It is worst for buildings without a visitor management system and relied on the retention of NRICs or other identification cards in exchange for a visitor pass. They will have to start from scratch to install the appropriate visitor management systems, Mr Thomas said. IMDA had previously said small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant to help defray the costs. The president added the association will help its members to adopt the new measures through its upcoming Comprehensive Guide for Security Agencies, due out this September, as well as its advisory services. “SAS supports this move,” Mr Thomas said. “Security agencies incur liability when holding on to physical NRICs as well as NRIC data. “The guidelines will help to ameliorate these issues, and the adoption of technology will be able to help in a big way, and is in line with the security industry’s transformation map.” One integrated facilities management company, UEMS, which provides services to close to 100 facilities including some public hospitals, said some of its security agencies currently collect or record NRIC numbers of visitors to the facilities. With the rule changes though, it will be working with its security agencies and clients to review existing processes and see how it can implement the updated rules, the spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia in an email. “We are exploring possible alternatives like user-generated IDs or organisation-issued QR codes as a replacement to the traditional NRIC collection,” added the spokesperson. Asked if the one-year transition period will be enough time for the changes, UEMS said it “seems sufficient for now”, a sentiment shared by Mr Thomas of Security Association Singapore. Mr Adrian Tan, TSMP Law Corporation’s head of Intellectual Property and Technology, Media and Telecom, concurred. He said the one-year period is appropriate given that Singaporeans have been living with this practice for decades. The lawyer did point out two groups that will have to “move quickly”: People who manage commercial buildings and condominiums, as they have to reorganise the way they identify and record visitors, and businesses who have been using NRIC numbers as an “expedient way to categorise members”. The latter group will have to think of a better substitute, and email addresses are a “good starting point”, he said. “I hope these guidelines represent the start of a long-delayed conversation that Singaporeans need to have about data collection. We need to talk about ways to educate Singaporeans about valuing and protecting their personal information,” Mr Tan said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/collection-of-nric-details-security-building-management-10680200"}, {"datetime": "03 Sep 2018 05:46PM", "tags": ["court", "Li Shengwu", "Lee Hsien Yang", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Court of Appeal allows Li Shengwu to appeal in contempt of court case", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Monday (Sep 3) gave the green light to Mr Li Shengwu to appeal against a previous decision that allowed the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) to serve papers on him outside Singapore, relating to a contempt of court case. The nephew of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is being sued by the AGC for allegedly saying in a Facebook post last July that Singapore has a \"pliant court system\", and that the Singapore Government was \"very litigious\". The High Court had in March dismissed Mr Li’s application to set aside the court order allowing the AGC to go ahead to serve the documents. Mr Li, who lives in the United States, applied to appeal the High Court's decision and it was granted on Monday by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, along with Judges of Appeal Judith Prakash and Steven Chong. The appeal will be heard at a date to be decided, but Chief Justice Menon said it would be expedited. He added that questions which should be addressed during the appeal include whether the court has the right to exercise jurisdiction over someone who commits contempt of court, but who is overseas when court proceedings start, and if it does, what statutes this is based on. \"If the defendant is in Singapore, I don't think there is an issue because of inherent jurisdiction,\" said the Chief Justice. \"But the problem comes when the defendant is not within Singapore.\" Mr Li's defence lawyer, Abraham Vergis from Providence Law Asia, took issue with the prosecutor's use of a particular section of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, saying that jurisdiction for contempt of court \"was never founded\" on that section. Chief Justice Menon said Mr Vergis raised \"a legitimate question that needs to be considered\". \"Is there jurisdiction over a (person who commits contempt of court but is overseas)? If there is, what is the jurisdiction,\" he said. Speaking for the three judges in the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice said: \"All three of us think this should be expedited. It is important both for clarifications of law and for the defendant.\" Mr Li, 33, previously said he does not intend to return to Singapore. He shared a post on Facebook over the weekend, indicating that he has started a new job at Harvard University as Assistant Professor of Economics. LEE HSIEN YANG QUESTIONS AGC’S ACTIONS AGAINST HIS SON The Facebook comments made by Mr Li that were allegedly in contempt of court were posted on the back of a public spat between his father Lee Hsien Yang, his aunt Lee Wei Ling and PM Lee. The dispute revolved around the future of the family home at 38 Oxley Road, which belonged to the siblings’ late father, Singapore’s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. Hours before the Court of Appeal’s decision on Monday, Mr Lee Hsien Yang questioned the AGC’s actions against his son. “Much stronger criticism of Singapore courts has recently been published in some international media and widely shared public posts. “AGC appears not to have commenced committal proceedings against the media and others, whilst nonetheless continuing this action against Shengwu for his private communications,” said Mr Lee in a Facebook post.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/li-shengwu-contempt-of-court-appeal-can-proceed-10679186"}, {"datetime": "03 Sep 2018 05:00PM", "tags": ["Public Transport Council"], "author": "", "title": "Public transport operators may increase fares by up to 4.3%", "content": " SINGAPORE: After three consecutive years of fare decreases, public transport operators could increase fares by up to 4.3 per cent, as bus and train capacity is ramped up. The Public Transport Council (PTC) announced this on Monday (Sep 3) as it begins the 2018 fare review exercise, which is based on a new formula that takes into account commuter demand and enhancements and growth in public transport capacity. The PTC said that the maximum allowable fare adjustment quantum to be considered is 4.3 per cent, after taking into account a 3.2 per cent reduction rolled over from the 2017 fare review exercise. Last year, the PTC considered a 5.4 per cent fare reduction based on the old formula, but implemented only a 2.2 per cent cut. The operators may submit their fare applications to the PTC by Oct 1. \"The PTC has reduced fares by a total of 8.3 per cent for the previous three consecutive years, largely due to the continued double-digit dip in energy prices,\" said PTC.   Last year's energy prices, which will be factored in this year's fare formula, rebounded by 26.2 per cent over the previous year.  Meanwhile, other macroeconomic price indices in the fare formula have also increased over the past year. The wage index, which is a proxy for the wage growth of public transport workers including bus captains and rail staff, went up by 3 per cent. The core consumer price index also rose by 1.5 per cent - the highest increase in three years, said PTC.  The new fare formula includes a new component called the Network Capacity Factor (NCF) of 3 per cent, which the council said \"balances commuter demand and public transport capacity enhancements and reflects the effort to provide commuters with more convenient and less crowded rides over the last year\". It added that more than two-thirds of the NCF was contributed by bus capacity improvements. Over the past five years, more than 1,000 new buses were introduced through the Bus Service Enhancement Programme and Bus Contracting Model.  More than 200 new trains were also added \"to augment the public transport capacity\", it said, adding that the costs were borne by the Government.  \"The Government has also committed to spending S$5 billion to subsidise public bus services, S$4 billion to renew rail operating assets and an additional S$20 billion on new public transport civil infrastructure over the next five years,\" said PTC.  The council said it will continue to keep public transport fares affordable to commuters, while also ensuring that the transport system remains financially sustainable.  The decision on the fare adjustment quantum will be announced in the last quarter of 2018, it added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/public-transport-operators-may-increase-fares-by-up-to-4-3-10680038"}, {"datetime": "03 Sep 2018 04:31PM", "tags": ["Football Association of Singapore", "Yazeen Buhari"], "author": "", "title": "Yazeen Buhari confirmed as FAS general secretary", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) on Monday (Sep 3) announced that Yazeen Buhari has been confirmed as its general secretary with effect from Sep 1.  Yazeen, 40, has been the association's acting general secretary since the start of the year after Winston Lee stepped down from the position. Lee had spent almost 10 years in the role.  The FAS said then that a \"deliberate search process encompassing internal and external candidates will ensue before a permanent appointment is announced\".  Yazeen was previously the association's head of development and planning, before he joined the Asian Football Confederation's planning and strategy department.  He also had stints with Sport Singapore as an assistant director and the Singapore Athletics as a general manager, and was a FIFA referee between 2011 and 2013.  Yazeen returned to the FAS in August 2017 to take on the role of deputy general secretary.

The group included freelance journalist Kirsten Han, civil rights activist Jolovan Wham and graphic novelist Sonny Liew. At the meeting, Dr Mahathir was invited to speak at a democracy conference next year. A day after his meeting with Dr Mahathir, Dr Thum posted on Facebook saying he had asked the Malaysian prime minister to take a leading role in promoting democracy and freedom of expression in Southeast Asia. Mr Shanmugam on Sunday described Dr Thum’s actions as “a little sad, a bit regretful”, after Mr Seah said in a Facebook post that the historian “does not wish Singapore well”. In his latest Facebook post, the historian said he will “never stop fighting for a Singapore that embraces these values and respects the dignity and rights of each and every individual”. “I also believe in engagement on the basis of mutual respect,” he added. Dr Thum went on to describe Malaysia as a “beacon of hope for democracy in Southeast Asia” and said he “expressed to Dr Mahathir the hope that many of us feel”. He also made reference to comments he made during a public forum in Johor Bahru on Aug 18, where he said he did not want “Singapore to ‘do a Malaysia’ – I want Singapore to do a Singapore”. He said: “The solution to many of Singapore’s problems lies with Singaporeans. But that does not preclude us from learning from others’ experiences to make our country better. Human rights are universal, and we can always aspire to improve the quality of our democracy.”  In March, Dr Thum and Mr Shanmugam had a six-hour exchange during a public hearing held by the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods over the academic’s alternative interpretation of historical events such as Operation Coldstore.

So I jumped up, grabbed the rope and attempted to loop the end of it around my feet to create a step - and failed miserably. It was a spectacular mess. But if the grunts around me were anything to go by, I wasn’t the only one lying in a crumpled heap. \"Most of us struggled with the low rope too, we couldn’t pull ourselves up!\" 13-year-old Athi Ramesh Athira piped afterwards. The student may be the camp’s youngest participant, but she already has her sights on becoming a regular in the army. Athi was one of 103 participants bunking in at Maju Camp for the inaugural Women’s Boot Camp over the weekend. We attempted the SOC station-by-station, wearing just a helmet. But during actual training, recruits typically carry about 10kg to 15kg of weight. This is a combination of a helmet, an SAR 21 (assault rifle) and a load-bearing vest. The camp, which is an initiative by the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD) and organised by Ang Mo Kio Women’s Executive Committee (WEC), was a scaled-down version of the actual National Service experience. NEWFOUND APPRECIATION More than 1,000 applicants had registered, but only a handful were selected. And out of the 103, 42 per cent of the participants were between 13 and 24 years old, while 9 per cent were above 50. The diversity meant that the activities had to be carefully calibrated to cater to various age groups. Still, it offered us a newfound appreciation of what soldiers go through. We were introduced to a buffet of culinary options - in the form of combat rations. On the menu were entrees like Hong Kong chicken noodles and Mexican cheese fried rice, as well as desserts like longan red bean and barley corn soup. But no matter how fancy the names were, they couldn’t mask the unappetising paste-like appearance of the rations. Some like the Mexican cheese fried rice were a tad too salty, but I was pleasantly surprised by the desserts, which were actually palatable. Sustenance is key though, and soldiers depend on such ration packs whenever they go for outfield missions. A meal pack can provide up to 1,000 calories.  \n\n\n\n\n While a certain level of health and fitness surely enables one to thrive in the army, it has to complement technical finesse. HANDLING SAR 21 Take handling the SAR 21 as an example. “First you take out the magazine, then you have to insert the round; make sure the sharp point faces away from you. Now slam it back in and make sure the safety catch is on,” the instructor barked, took one look at our puzzled faces and repeated the steps at a slower pace. We tried different firing postures and practised loading the rifle several times. While a few managed to complete the process expertly, most of us bungled up the steps. This was my first time handling a rifle, and frankly, just going through the brief introduction was a rather intimidating experience. But no amount of preparation could simulate the real deal. When we traipsed out onto the grounds for the SAR 21 firing exercise, the unmistakable whiff of gunpowder was in the air. For about an hour, the relative peace at Maju Camp was interrupted by a series of loud cracks and bright flashes as shots rang out in rapid succession. The rifles, when fitted with a laser and loaded with rounds, can weigh up to 4.5kg. Now imagine having all that weight slamming into your shoulder, and going temporarily deaf from the sharp crack of the shot at the same time.   It was both thrilling and mortifying. And of course, I missed all my targets.  Other first-time shooters echoed the same sentiment. \"Before handling the weapon, I thought that it was not that heavy. But it's about 4kg! I can carry a rice bag that is 4kg, but not something like this. So it's quite difficult to bring the rifle up, hold it there and focus on your target. After going through this, I find that this is not easy at all,” said Mdm Patsy Chong. Though the 61-year-old is one of the oldest participants in the camp, she had no qualms about attempting every activity - down to even trying her hand at the firemen lift, during a session on Casualty Evacuation. The freelance teacher has three sons, one of whom just completed his NS and encouraged her to go for the camp. “They don’t talk much about their time in army,” she admitted, hoping that this camp would provide some insight to what her sons go through. Like Mdm Chong, many of the women present had relatives in the service, and safety was a perennial concern. This issue was raised several times during the Focus Group Discussion on the first evening, which Senior Minister of State for Defence Dr Maliki Osman attended with Ang Mo Kio’s WEC chairman Ms Joanna Portilla. “As the mothers, the wives of NS men, they wonder about the safety measures put in place when the boys go through the training. So through this experience, they realise that there are safety measures. And it's repeatedly impressed upon the men that they must adhere to,” Ms Portilla said. SAFETY PROTOCOLS This means that every activity comes with its own set of safety protocols, such as warm-up and cool-down exercises, a water parade as well as a mandatory declaration of medical issues. On one occasion, instructors even whipped out thermometers to check participants’ temperatures. In fact, safety was also a reason we were only allowed to try nine out of 12 SOC stations, as none of us had combat boots, which can provide proper support on the balancing bridge and the apex ladder. For now, organisers have not confirmed if the event will make a comeback, but they will explore the possibility of doing so after studying the post-event survey. Sure, the activities aren’t on the same intensity as an actual NS experience and nobody was gunning for a marksmanship badge or aiming to be the best recruit. But the brief event cracked open the hinges of a usually closed door, and offered a chance for mothers, daughters, spouses and friends to connect better with those who serve. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mindef-saf-women-boot-camp-national-service-10678108"}, {"datetime": "03 Sep 2018 06:24AM", "tags": ["court", "crime", "drugs", "inequality", "privilege"], "author": "Natalie Pang", "title": "Commentary: Behind the public shaming of one wealthy elite, a disturbing but growing divide", "content": " SINGAPORE: On Monday (Aug 27), soon after news of Audrey Tay, the daughter of The Hour Glass founders, pleading guilty to taking drugs and causing a car crash that uprooted a divider broke, netizens flooded social media with harsh comments. Yet, many comments were not about her wrongdoing, but focused on her inherited wealth and how her privilege may cushion her from the consequences of her misdemeanours, with some labelling her a “Crazy Rich Asian”. To many, Audrey Tay embodied a certain type of wealthy elite, for whom Singapore seems to be a playground that allows them to live out profligate and reckless lifestyles, with little personal consequences because of their wealth and social capital. EVERYDAY OPINIONS UNLEASHED You would not expect people to come up to Audrey Tay to make these vicious comments to her face. Yet it seems that social media platforms, be it Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or blogs have become platforms through which everyday opinions and sentiments are unleashed with little consideration and put on public display. While it is likely that this is a result of otherwise personal conversations crossing a very blurred boundary to become public, many are expressing the same sentiments because they think others share these thoughts. But the ease of expressing such sentiments on social media is just one part of the story. That so many think these are dominant opinions suggests something even more disturbing. Is this what the debate on inequality is moving towards? Class consciousness and a growing awareness of the divide between the privileged and less privileged Singaporeans have heightened over the past year, and Audrey Tay may have been an all too convenient target for those rallying against her. Might it be that Tay sticks out because her story violates sensibilities of average Singaporeans who work hard and believe in hard work? Or that her story touched a deeply seated discomfort with wealthy elites?  It would be frightening if such attitudes are left to fester and grow in time to become a sweeping, simplistic categorisation about everyone with wealth. When identity instead of issues guide public discourse, people forget that even among the affluent, there are differences. When issues are no longer the focus, society may never get to the stage of actually talking about and deliberating on possible solutions. KINDNESS AND MUTUAL RESPECT Where should we go from here? Reactions to Tay’s case suggest a need for greater empathy and restraint. While the online space has allowed debates and diverse opinions to be expressed, it must maintain some civility. Media literacy campaigns have achieved much, in coming up with guidelines for using social media platforms.  Thinking before posting, encouraging mutual respect and kindness, and building a social ecosystem in which support is available whenever someone encounters a sticky situation online – these are all incredibly important to cultivate and there’s space for our education curriculum to help digital natives adjust to this reality. These are all the more critical when debates on social issues of the day, such as inequality, have the potential to turn emotional and generate harsh or unkind remarks that are regarded as “truths” to one side. But they alone are insufficient. The deeper question here is to ask how such divides can be healed. What are the values and shared experiences that can unite us as a society? How can they be communicated, and more importantly, used to connect and engage a thinking citizenry? In what ways can the online community be an inclusive, constructive one? When opinions and subsequent mobilisation are driven by identity, emotions and not issues, what are the implications?  It is also important to bear in mind that the social media environment is a “global-local” one. As individuals encounter local causes on Facebook, they also encounter external movements beyond Singapore, all communicating their own values and opinions that may shape societal views of issues here. More than ever, it is time to understand our digital citizenship – not just in understanding how to be a responsible digital citizen, but also how our values are evolving or conflicting as a society as a result of our digital interactions.  Natalie Pang is a senior research fellow from Social Lab at the Institute of Policy Studies, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/daugher-hour-glass-founders-audrey-tay-inequality-privilege-10676900"}, {"datetime": "03 Sep 2018 06:00AM", "tags": ["lift repairs", "artificial intelligence"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "AI eyed to help bring lift maintenance to a higher level", "content": " SINGAPORE: A “fresh pair of eyes” to look at an age-old problem: How to better predict when a lift is going to break down, or when it is in urgent need of servicing to prevent a malfunction? That is the problem Surbana Jurong is hoping to solve as it monitors 25,000 lifts under its charge. Its current lift maintenance system already tracks 21 fault indicators such as whether a lift is travelling too fast or too slow but does not have a predictive element, explained Dr Chuah Jun Wei, head of Internet of Things (IoT) and Data Science at the urban consulting firm, told Channel NewsAsia during a recent interview. “Whenever these lifts have faults, then the system is triggered. It is more of an alert system.” Mr Cliff Chuah, head of Innovation Program Office at Surbana Jurong, added in the same interview that the industry traditionally went with preventive maintenance, which is based on fixed servicing schedules. “If a lift is making a loud noise already, then sending someone down to fix it is a matter of course,” Mr Chuah said. “But what if it is just making a soft sound, but this factor, combined with other indicators, could lead to a prediction of a lift fault and gets you to send a technician down before it happens?” Two apprentices from AI Singapore’s (AISG) training programme have been roped in to help the urban consulting firm come up with a solution - a prediction model using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify lift faults one week before the lifts actually break down. This will ideally complement its current system, the Surbana Jurong executive said.  It would also help companies like Surbana Jurong better allocate its manpower, considering the lack of technicians in the industry currently, he added.  A 2017 report stated that more than 2,000 lift technicians service more than 63,000 lifts in Singapore, with plans to attract 1,000 more in the next three years. GROOMING AI TALENT Beyond helping to solve an industry pain point, the AI project also serves another purpose: Supporting Singapore's efforts to groom AI talent by allowing apprentices to work on real-world problems, said Dr Chuah. One of the two apprentices Surbana Jurong is working with, Ms Eunice Soh, was cited in Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran’s speech at AISG's first-year anniversary event on Thursday (Aug 30).  Mr Iswaran pointed out that while she majored in life sciences and does not have a computer science background, opportunities like the AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP) is helping her, and others like her, to pursue their aspirations in the field of AI. Speaking to Channel NewsAsia at the sidelines of the event, Ms Soh, 27, shared that she has always wanted to get into data science but “chose the wrong major”. She professed to an early interest and liking to computers, which led her to join the media club in her secondary school. Before signing up for AIAP, she was at a job which required her to handle and analyse data, Ms Soh shared. The other apprentice, Mr Lee Chengkai, also left his job in software development to pursue his interest in this field. “I felt I wasn’t really growing anymore,” the 28-year-old shared. With the Surbana Jurong project, he is able to deal with a huge volume of data that is “challenging” and exposes him to machine learning and statistical learning, which he professed to “having no clue of before”. “These are good skills for data engineers to have in general,” Mr Lee said. Mr Lee said the project started in May this year and the team is currently setting up the infrastructure for the collection of the sensor data being sent back by the IoT boxes installed on 1,000 lifts, which is why the analysis of the data has yet to start. Surbana’s Dr Chuah said he is looking to hire both Ms Soh and Mr Lee after the AI project is over as he looks to grow his “small” team which was formed in 2017. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/ai-lift-maintenance-artificial-intelligence-training-programme-10671366"}, {"datetime": "02 Sep 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Team Singapore", "bridge", "sport"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "Playing their cards right: Singapore’s contract bridge team aim to build on Asian Games success", "content": " SINGAPORE: One of the first things eight-year-old Fong Lay Yee did when she met her father Fong Kien Hoong, after he touched down at Changi Airport on Sunday (Sep 2), was to ask him to show his Asian Games gold medal. “She’s still in disbelief,” said Lay Yee’s mother Tan Sock Ngin.  “I told her that her father won a gold medal. Then she was like, ‘how come daddy is not on television?’ I was stunned and didn’t know how to answer her.” They were among close to 20 supporters who were at the airport to welcome back members of Singapore’s contract bridge team upon their return from the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang.

The team are feeling invigorated after their success in Indonesia. “We’re very happy that there has been heightened awareness about bridge among the Singapore community,” said Poon, a professional contract bridge player. “We are hoping more young players will come forward and pick up the game.” There are plans in the works to start a bridge school in Singapore by the end of the year, revealed Poon. “We are hoping more will enjoy this game as much as we do and benefit from it,” he added. “Starting at a younger age would give players a stronger foundation and give players higher standards as they progress.” Improving the standards of women contract bridge players will also be an area of particular focus for the Singapore Contract Bridge Association, added team captain Chua Gang. “We are going to give more support to female players and give them more exposure to international games and training,” he added. Other members of the squad also hope that greater recognition will be afforded to contract bridge. “We hope for more financial support. Every time when we have to go overseas for any tournaments, it’s all self-funded and those who have not started working - it’s a bit difficult,” said Tan, who participated in the super mixed team event.  “I hope there will be more recognition for us as a mind sport.” With a shiny gold medal hanging around Lay Yee’s neck, Fong reflected on his team’s win. “Winning a gold medal is something that I can show my kids - if you put your heart and effort into it, you can achieve things you aim for,” he said.  “Hopefully I can be some sort of role model to them, to remind them to try their best in whatever they do.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/singapore-contract-bridge-team-asian-games-success-10676962"}, {"datetime": "02 Sep 2018 03:41PM", "tags": ["K Shanmugam", "Thum Ping Tjin", "Singapore", "Mahathir Mohamad"], "author": "Nisha Abdul Rahim", "title": "‘A little sad, a bit regretful': Shanmugam on activists' move to engage Mahathir", "content": " SINGAPORE: Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam has hit out at the move by a group of activists - led by political dissident Tan Wah Piow and historian Thum Ping Tjin - to engage Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.  The duo - along with freelance journalist Kirsten Han, civil rights activist Jolovan Wham and graphic novelist Sonny Liew - met Dr Mahathir last Thursday (Aug 30), where they invited him to speak at a democracy conference next year. On the sidelines of a grassroots event on Sunday (Sep 2), Mr Shanmugam said: “I think the whole conduct is a little sad, a bit regretful. We can have political differences within Singapore - it is the people’s right. “We should never go out and invite someone foreign, a foreign politician to intervene in our domestic politics. I think that is an absolute no-no.” A day after his meeting with Dr Mahathir, Dr Thum posted on Facebook saying he had asked the Malaysian leader to take a leading role in promoting democracy and freedom of expression in Southeast Asia. Mr Shanmugam said: \"I think it’s quite clear what that means.\" In March, Dr Thum and Mr Shanmugam had crossed swords for six hours at a public hearing held by the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods over the academic’s alternative interpretation of historical events such as Operation Coldstore. Last Thursday's meeting was organised with the help of Malaysian political activist, Hishammuddin Rais, who was present and is also part of Tan’s organisation - Forces for the Renewal of Southeast Asia. Mr Shanmugam's comments came a day after Marine Parade GRC MP Seah Kian Peng hit out at Dr Thum over his Facebook posts that, in Mr Seah's words, show that the historian \"does not wish Singapore well\". Mr Seah questioned Dr Thum's invitation to the Malaysian prime minister to \"bring democracy to Singapore\". \"I wonder what deep historical insight prompted him to make this plea, to Dr M, whose views on the Water Agreement with Singapore, and Singapore knowing its place in relation to Malaysia are well known,\" he wrote.

The dual honour will be presented as part of 31 HDB awards for design, construction and engineering feats. It recognises Kampung Admiralty’s “unconventional layered design approach that created tiers of lush greenery which double up as community spaces”, said HDB in a press release.  The mixed development project was additionally awarded the CONQUAS (Construction Quality Assessment System) STAR, conferred upon those with scores above 95 for quality workmanship. In the housing category, Punggol Waterway View and Depot Heights also picked up design awards, with HDB singling out the former for its distinctive architectural features.  “The rustic ‘kelong’ theme, inspired by Punggol’s early beginnings as a “kelong” or fishing village, is reflected in the colour selection of the blocks, mimicking natural wood in the façade treatment, as well as the use of the stilt-like columns for the outdoor decks,” said HDB. “We work very closely with our consultants to try and maximise the potential of each site, and we try to do something that brings forth the identity of each precinct,” said Jeremiah Lim, HDB’s deputy director for design policy. “We are committed to delivering more well-designed, community-centric and well-built environments for our residents.” The SkyPeak @ Bukit Batok housing project, which won a construction award, was also given mention by HDB for overcoming the challenge of being located between two primary schools. “The project team engaged the schools, grassroots, and the Town Council throughout the entire construction process, working closely with each of the stakeholders to mitigate construction noise and dust,” said HDB. Another Bukit Batok housing project - West Terra - won an inaugural engineering award for using Pre-fabricated Volumetric Construction (PVC) technology over the conventional two-dimensional precast method. A ground-breaking Pulau Tekong land reclamation method also scooped up an engineering award for innovation. “With the unwavering support of our architectural and engineering consultants, as well as our building contractors, we have been able to deliver on our mission of creating vibrant towns and quality homes,” said HDB’s chief executive officer Dr Cheong Koon Hean.  “We will continue to work in close partnership with them to bring more endearing homes to Singaporeans.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-kampung-admiralty-hdb-punggol-waterway-bukit-batok-10676450"}, {"datetime": "02 Sep 2018 09:41AM", "tags": ["hawker culture", "KF Seetoh", "NEA"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Some social enterprise hawkers unconvinced by business model of packaged charges", "content": " SINGAPORE: Some hawkers with stalls at not-for-profit, social enterprise hawker centres have confirmed that issues about costs flagged by Makansutra founder KF Seetoh are a cause for concern. On Tuesday (Aug 28), Mr Seetoh published a post on the Makansutra website highlighting the extra costs on top of the rental that social enterprise hawkers can be made to pay as part of monthly expenses.  The expenses can include charges for crockery washing and coin exchange services, as well as a S$600 fee for monthly cleanliness inspections, he noted. He said that some charges, which some stall holders said were compulsory, are \"shocking\".  Hawker centre operator Fei Siong Food Management said that the S$600 it charged a stall recently was for an optional inspection service.  In a statement to Channel NewsAsia, a Fei Siong spokesperson said that the S$600 consultancy fee is for hawkers that \"require help in professional services such as food quality and hygiene audits\".  The service is not compulsory for hawkers, nor is the coin exchange, which the company said is a non-profit service it offers.  Fei Siong's social enterprise arm was awarded the tender to run Ci Yuan Community Club Hawker Centre on a \"not-for-profit\" basis in 2015.  When Channel NewsAsia visited the centre on Saturday, hawkers who were willing to be interviewed insisted that the S$600 inspection fee was not optional.  \"We were told about the fee in July when our contract was up. It came out of nowhere, and they told us that it is for the NEA (National Environment Agency) and quality control,\" said one hawker.  The hawker, who did not want to be named, said that he eventually gave in and paid up to remain at the same stall. So far, one inspection has been conducted since the re-contract last month.  \"Somebody came to take a look at our stall. It was over in just a minute. They came in, took a brief look at our stall and left. I don't know if that person is from NEA,\" the hawker said.  The hawker also revealed that they were charged S$50 during the re-contract for exchanging coins with the operator.  Another hawker, who also asked to remain anonymous, packed up and left after the centre's management failed to properly explain the monthly inspection fee. \"I was asked to continue by signing both agreements or my (hawker) licence will not be renewed. I was told I cannot opt out. If it is optional, why did none of the stalls opt out to reduce costs,\" this hawker told Channel NewsAsia in a phone interview.  In a WhatsApp message between the hawker and management that was shown to Channel NewsAsia, the S$600 fee was said to be compulsory. MEASURES TO ENSURE COSTS ARE KEPT \"AFFORDABLE\" The model of appointing socially conscious operators was introduced in 2015 with the completion of Ci Yuan Hawker Centre and Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre.  In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, the NEA said there are currently 13 new and existing hawker centres and markets appointed by social enterprises such as Fei Siong, NTUC Foodfare, Timbre, Koufu and Kopitiam.  Under this model, NEA said it has \"put in place measures to ensure that the managing agents keep food prices and stall rental (and other operating costs) affordable\".  The total cost for stallholders is one of the key evaluation criteria for NEA in the tender. The median stall rental at social enterprise hawker centres is S$2,000, said NEA.  \"IT'S ALL BEING TAKEN CARE OF\" There are social enterprise hawkers who have found a package deal helpful. One of them is Madam Soryati Pokol, founder of Warong Lorong Fatimah at the NTUC-run Kampung Admiralty.  She pays about S$4,000 a month and it covers a gamut of services from cleaning to waste management, as well as her stall rental. \"NTUC is reasonable. It includes everything, waste management and all. It's all being taken care of so I only have to focus on my own thing,\" said Madam Soryati.  However, for several other social enterprise hawkers, the issue of paying more than those managed by NEA was a cause for concern.  A hawker, who goes by Mr Yeo, said that NEA-run hawker centres have a \"flat-rate\" and costs are \"one-layer\".  For his social enterprise-run stall at a hawker centre in the north, Mr Yeo said he pays about S$2,000 in rental, but his monthly expenses come up to more than S$4,000 a month after taking into account a range of service charges.  Mr Yeo's rental is determined by the hawker operator under the social enterprise model, whereas in NEA's model, the rental is determined by tender bidding prices. In July, successful bid prices ranged from S$8 to S$10,028. The median price of the bids was S$610.  \"At the end of the day, an NEA hawker centre is still cheaper for hawkers. The rental may be comparable to NEA hawkers, but the add-ons make it more expensive,\" Mr Yeo said.  Another social enterprise hawker said he has to pay S$80 a month for a point-of-sale (POS) system that includes a tablet, as well as cashier and back-end systems. He said he is considering closing up shop due to the extra costs and poor footfall.  \"I have to pay for the POS system for three years. It's about S$3,000 and at the end of the day it's not even mine. Why are we taking on such a cost? Back at NEA, whatever POS you use, you purchase it directly. If I shift away, the POS is still with me,\" he said.  The hawker told Channel NewsAsia by ending his contract two years earlier than its stipulated three-year period, he may lose his security deposit of two months' rental.   \"It's like digging a hole and asking us to jump in. Then they bury us.\"  \"To promote 'hawkerpreneurship', you need to set the processes and procedures right. It has to be same as the operation of NEA-managed hawker centres. NEA should have regulated the social enterprise hawker centres like it does with the regular hawker centres,\" the hawker added.  Timbre's managing director Edward Chia explained that some of these extra costs are put in place to \"elevate\" hawkers. Mr Chia added that Timbre does not mark up any cost incurred by third-party vendors and instead subsidises it.  For example, half of the cost for the POS system is borne by Timbre.  \"We pay a lot more to the vendor from the hardware to the software. Today everything is in the cloud. There's also an annual licensing fee that we have to pay - we subsidise that as well,\" said Mr Chia.  \"At some point, I wish to be able to provide our stallholders with data analytics so they understand their business a bit better,\" he added.  Hawkers at Timbre's Yishun Park hawker centre have to absorb the 10 per cent discount when customers choose to pay with Timbre's own membership app. To that, Mr Chia said that this is not unlike how hawkers give discounts or extras to customers before the app - which took a six-digit sum to develop and maintain - came into the picture.  \"If everybody is going to have their own form of an informal loyalty scheme, why don't we come together to have a unified account scheme. We felt that 10 per cent is not high and it is something that hawkers are prepared to give to their customers,\" he added.  \"BETTER MANAGEMENT, BETTER SERVICE AND STABLE PRICES\" Meanwhile, NEA said it thanks Mr Seetoh for his feedback and appreciates his passion for the hawker trade. \"Ultimately, the hawker centres being run by socially-conscious operators should be for better management, better service and stable prices which in turn benefit consumers,\" it said. \"The Government is committed to upholding the role of hawker centres as community dining rooms, and will continue to adapt and enhance this key social infrastructure so that it remains relevant and attractive to our diverse population.\"​​​​​​​", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/social-enterprise-hawkers-compulsory-charges-10672516"}, {"datetime": "02 Sep 2018 08:40AM", "tags": ["Catholic Church", "Singapore", "Archbishop William Goh"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore Catholic Church steps up measures to reduce the risk of child abuse", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Catholic Church in Singapore is now reporting all claims of child abuse to the police when its own investigation team looks into such allegations, the Archbishop of Singapore said on Saturday (Sep 1). In a message on the church’s website about sex abuse scandals overseas, the Most Reverend William Goh said a handful of cases had emerged in Singapore. “These were handed over to the Professional Standards Office (PSO) of the Archdiocese for investigation. Thus far, all the cases have been judged to be inconclusive by the PSO,” he said, adding that to the best of his knowledge, there have been no cover-ups in Singapore. The PSO was set up in 2011, is staffed by “lay professionals” and its investigations are conducted at arm’s length from the Archbishop, Rev Goh said. “This is to ensure total impartiality and non-interference from the Archbishop’s Office.” The message also said that any allegations of abuse must now also be reported to the police when the PSO takes up the case.  “This is to discourage falsified or exaggerated claims which malign the innocent, as the pain of being questioned and living under suspicion while waiting for judgement to be pronounced can be as traumatic for these priests as it is for those who have truly been abused,” said the Archbishop. The church in Singapore has also put in place systems and processes to reduce the risk of sexual abuse. For example, all priests and employees must declare that they have not been convicted of any sex offences. And those with known records “will not be allowed to work in ministry or mingle with the vulnerable”. In addition, those “who want to join priestly or religious life will not only have to sign this declaration but they would be subjected to more stringent psychological tests and background checks”. Church volunteers, especially those dealing with children, will need to be “vetted and cleared of sexual crimes against children”. The enhanced measures come against a backdrop of numerous child abuse cases involving the Catholic Church around the world. In his message, the Archbishop of Singapore highlighted the news from last month that some 300 priests had sexually abused over a thousand children in Pennsylvania over the last 70 years. Last month while visiting Ireland, Pope Francis said he was ashamed of the Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the crimes of sex abuse by clergy. Rev Goh echoed those sentiments: “With the growing number of revelations and scathing reports from the media, we cannot but begin to doubt our Church leaders,” he said, noting that some people feel ashamed to be associated with the Catholic Church.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-catholic-church-steps-up-measures-to-reduce-the-risk-10676328"}, {"datetime": "02 Sep 2018 06:23AM", "tags": [], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Companies going green: Sustainability strategies that also make good business sense", "content": " SINGAPORE: More companies in Singapore are climbing onto the green bandwagon with initiatives like reducing plastic bag use or doing away with packaging altogether, a move that marketing experts say makes good business sense as there is growing consumer support for such strategies. Chief executive of media, creative and digital communications agency Dentsu Aegis Network Asia Pacific Nick Waters said that many people are becoming more environmentally aware, especially younger consumers who place an emphasis on a brand’s sustainability practices in their purchasing decisions. “As a result, brands are increasingly putting focus on green efforts and we see service-based new economy clients having a stronger appetite to go green. This is usually because their business model allows them to be more agile,” he said. Managing director for Singapore and Southeast Asia at public relations agency Golin, Tarun Deo, echoed this view on the attitudes off younger consumers. “If done well, being green is a genuine opportunity to increase sales, especially with millennials, who arguably are more sensitive to most green issues,” he said. Mr Deo said that many of Golin's clients are looking at the green space more vigorously than in the past. But he also said that “going green” can mean different things. “Everyone interprets the sense of this in a different way. They think it is something that they need to do to ensure that their reputation is in keeping with the times,\" he said. While he said it is a generally good thing, he questioned if companies are going far enough to drive change. “Companies always come to us and say give me the one big idea, but this has to happen progressively. Longevity is a big factor. What you are doing today has to be long-term,” he said. Mr Ken Hickson, who runs a sustainability consultancy and has been working in the green space for more than 10 years, said that environmental consciousness in Singapore is still a work in progress. However, he suggested that businesses need to do more than simply pay lip service to sustainable strategies. “Some companies have definitely got on the green bandwagon, presumably to boost sales, but it’s not going to work unless you commit to taking real action that benefits the environment,” he said. Lars Voedisch, managing director of PRecious Communications - which represents many international brands - said that while it does not hurt a company’s reputation if it is trying to do the right thing, there is less love for companies that have one-off eco-friendly initiatives in the name of corporate social responsibility. He added that consumers have patience for companies that show that they are on a journey towards sustainability.  COMPANIES TAKE STEPS TO CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT Asia-Pacific Breweries’ director of corporate affairs Mitchell Leow gave an insight into his company’s perspective on recycling glass bottles. “To put in that system, it's going to cost us - for manpower, logistics. When bottles come back, we have to wash them. It's going to incur costs,” he said. The motivation behind the company’s green efforts, which started more than 10 years ago, was “doing the right thing”, he said. APB, which produces Tiger Beer, has waste treatment plants onsite to recycle water used in the brewing process and solar panels that reduce its carbon footprint by 20 per cent, and a returnable bottle system with an 86 per cent return rate. Elsewhere, NTUC FairPrice, which has more than 200 outlets, launched a plastic bag management framework to reduce the use of plastic bags, while Starbucks earlier this month said that it will be banning straws in outlets worldwide by 2020. At RedMart, eco-friendly products under the company's label are more affordable than those from better-known brands. \"We believe being environmentally friendly should not come at an extra cost,” said RedMart’s head of non-foods Emma Paterson. A check on its  website showed that itsForest Stewardship Council (FSC) -certified 3-ply toilet paper at S$5.20 was cheaper than other products that were similarly certified. For example, a product from another brand cost S$6.95, for the same quantity. FSC is not-for-profit organisation established to promote the responsible management of the world's forests. REAPING THE BENEFITS OF GREEN BRANDING RedMart reported similar growth.Its FSC-certified toilet paper sales, for example, have more than doubled in 2017 compared to 2016, Ms Paterson said.  \"We can see increasing awareness and demand for such products. Based on growing sales, we believe our customers are getting more environmentally conscious,\" she added. Ms Jacqueline Singer, founder of Neis Haus, which specialises in eco-friendly products such as beeswax wraps and reusable straws, echoed the same views, describing growth since 2014 as “exponential”. “Back in 2014, awareness was low compared to other countries like Australia and New Zealand. But since then, we've seen a huge growth in awareness, which has been helped by events like Earthfest, and some great social media groups locally,” she said. She added that the interest is both from Singaporeans and expats, and cuts across ages. However, the journey for retailers hoping to promote sustainability may be an uphill one. Mrs Mui-Kok acknowledged that there are some challenges in offering such products.  “A key barrier to bringing in these products is relatively higher costs due to the lower demand and supply for these products.  Currently, eco-friendly products in the market are more expensive than mass, conventional brands,” she said. She added that it takes time for consumers to adopt environmentally-conscious efforts and choices. Head of business strategy and development at the Singapore Environment Council Tay Sok Leng Said that when people bring sustainable practices to their offices and their homes and develop daily habits, market forces will eventually react. BUYING BETTER NOT ONLY SOLUTION Whether consumers consciously purchase goods that lower their environmental footprint, they can still contribute to sustainability, said Ms Pek Hailin from environmental group Zero Waste SG. \"Refusal is the easiest way to start without buying anything,\" she said. For example, she said consumers could refuse straws and bags when they do not need them, and buy items without excessive packaging.  Dining at places instead of doing takeaways can also be less wasteful, especially at locations that do not serve disposables, she added.  When waste is generated, deciding whether it can be recycled first before discarding it into the general waste bin is also a good step to take, she said.  “Reusing what we already have and items around us, thinking twice about whether one needs an item before buying will definitely help as well.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/companies-going-green-sustainability-business-sense-10555422"}, {"datetime": "02 Sep 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["cna insider", "ageing", "instagram"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "The loneliness of old age - and an experiment to see if Instagram can be a cure", "content": " SINGAPORE: One by one, her family and friends had died or disappeared, leaving her alone. Isolated, Madam Wong Sok Ying could go for days without human contact, holed up most of the day in her one-room rental flat sparsely furnished with an arm chair, single bed, wardrobe, table and little else. “The TV is my best friend. No TV, I cannot pass the day. (I’d be) so lonely,” she said with a wry smile. “The radio is my friend, the newspaper is my friend. These three things are my very best friends.” It is not as if she’s hungry for visitors. “People seldom come to my house because I don’t like them to come in. Some people don’t know when to go home,” grumbled the 79-year-old, who twice a day, would step out of her flat for breakfast and for lunch at the same coffeeshop opposite her block. But there’s a grimmer reason behind her reluctance to socialise. After 15 years in remission, she found out several months ago that her stomach cancer had returned. In Singapore, the number of seniors living alone like Madam Wong has increased. It is estimated that 83,000 elderly persons will be living alone by 2030, according to the Department of Statistics, compared with the 47,000 seniors aged 65 and above in 2016. Many of these seniors who live alone have little contact with anyone and are at risk of social isolation and depression. A National University of Singapore study in 2004 found that seniors living alone were twice as likely as their peers to develop depressive symptoms. In 2017, the number of seniors aged 60 and above who took their own lives peaked at 129 – and social disconnect was cited as a contributing factor. But could social media – more often seen as alienating the older generation – in fact help seniors bridge the lonely void? To prove that tools like Instagram and Facebook could empower the elderly, if only people took the time to introduce them to it, the series #DontForgetMe roped in four seniors, including Mdm Wong. They were linked up with Instagram photographers Yafiq and Yais Yusman, 25, twins with more than 100,000 followers between them. Their mission was to teach these seniors how to reconnect with the world by sharing their stories on the platform. WATCH: The social experiment (4:07),   Poignantly, perhaps it was also a way of leaving a legacy of their life; a mark of their existence. Said Mdm Wong on agreeing to the Instagram project: “I don’t know how long I will stay here. So I must let my friends know that I am still here.” (Watch the full episode here.) LONELY EVEN IN A BIG FAMILY In many ways, former teacher Cedric Monteiro’s life was a sharp contrast to hers – the 80-year-old shares a terrace home with his children and grandchildren. And yet, he too craved company, with his family members occupied with work and school. Like Mdm Wong, he’d lost touch with many of his friends or they had died. “Most of the days, I’m alone, everybody is busy,\" he said. Sometimes, you yearn to talk to somebody, you know? The oldest among the four seniors in the social experiment, Mr Monteiro was perhaps the most digital savvy: His iPad was his daily companion, for reading the news and connecting with friends – over 200 of them – on Facebook. But his grandchildren were who he struggled to make a deeper connection with. Besides wanting to learn how to take and post food pictures on Instagram, he hoped to share his glory days with them – as a former sprinter and national record holder in the 1960s. In the case of Madam Hamidah Mohamad Noor, 69, her five cats were her main companions in her one-room flat. She jumped at the project for the chance to try something different. “I am alone. I don’t know who to talk to, I feel bored,” she said. “My cats are my very best friends… I feel happy that at least something likes me.” As for Madam Jessie Seng, 69, she filled her post-retirement days painting and writing, so picking up Instagram photography was another artistic avenue to explore. MAKING REAL CONNECTIONS The Yusman twins – self-confessed introverts by nature – had almost two months of coaching to help the four come out of their shell, so to speak. Their first reality check came when teaching Mdm Wong how to use her new sponsored Sony Mobile smartphone. She struggled to think of a contact she could save. “My old friends have all gone to heaven,” she told them, able to cite only a neighbour living downstairs who was her emergency contact. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reflected Mr Yais afterward: “I was quite shocked that she only had one contact to save. It shows that she is socially isolated, which is quite sad.” “The older people are being forgotten,” he added. “It’s actually quite nice to listen to their stories and get to know them.” Over time, the seniors were taught how to take selfies, frame photos and upload their work on Instagram. It didn’t matter much that their pictures were sometimes out of focus or oddly composed. For Mr Monteiro, it was the chance to convince granddaughters Regina and Isabel to spend time with him on a “photo walk” along the Cavenagh Bridge, which he peppered with his stories about cycling across the bridge and swimming in the Singapore River. And Mdm Wong, who had been feeling down ever since her cancer relapse, was filled with new energy after a visit by Yais. He taught her how to take creative pictures of even familiar objects like her furniture, and she shared why her bed was special to her. It was a gift from Lions Befrienders, a social service organisation. “I (used to) sleep on the floor. Then they said, ‘Aunty, you are old already, you cannot sleep on the floor’,” she recounted. Cheered up after that visit, she made a rare effort to chat with a casual acquaintance who happened by as she was out taking photos. The two women ended up exploring their estate together. FOUR LESS LONELY PEOPLE Aside from real connections struck in the process, some of the seniors were surprised by the Instagram followers they gained, having started from scratch. “I didn’t think that something like this would happen to me. I am very proud,” said Mdm Hamidah (@hamidah6807), who has over 240 followers to date on her Instagram account, and many pictures of cats. She has also taken to sharing her new hobby with other single ‘cat ladies’ in her Toa Payoh neighbourhood. Mdm Seng (@suyingxin.jessie), with some 200 followers, has mastered using Insta Stories to show how ‘happening’ her life is. “It’s like journal, one that I can do every day,” she said. For grandpa Monteiro (@cedricmonteiro_), his over 490 followers now include his two granddaughters, who were proudly telling their friends about his Instagram account. He and the other seniors also had their works displayed at an exhibition in July. “He’s quite cool. He’s so modern, he’s so hip,” raved Isabel. “Maybe I should follow him back. I should make sure he posts more photos of me and him together...  I have the coolest grandfather on the Internet. Executive producer of the #DontForgetMe series Sharon Hun acknowledged that when the team first started production, they were sceptical about whether an old person could pick up and benefit from Instagram. “We were so wrong. They were so eager to learn,” said Ms Hun. “To see their smiles when they got one ‘like’ was so satisfying.” She added that teaching the elderly to tap technology isn’t just about getting them to be part of our society – it is also about hoping that they can change lives. Madam Wong (@wongsokyin8), who has more than 440 followers, has since spent more time socialising with her neighbours. Showing Mr Yais the photo evidence of this, she said: “This is my friend. The other day I was downstairs taking photos and she came to join me. This morning also I drank coffee with her.” She now seems to dislike company a little less.

Mr Seah was referring to a Facebook post Dr Thum made on Friday, which appeared to suggest that Singaporeans should celebrate Malaysia's independence day. \"Selamat Hari Merdeka to the people of the former Federation of Malaya!(and happy unofficial independence day to the people of Singapore!),\" Dr Thum wrote in the post.  That post came a day after Dr Thum, along with Tan Wah Piow, author Sonny Liew, as well as activists Kirsten Han and Jolovan Wham, met with Malaysia Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad. During the meeting, Dr Thum urged Dr Mahathir to \"take the lead in lobbying for the promotion of democracy and freedom of expression and inquiry in Southeast Asia\". He subsequently made the following remarks: “I felt Malaysia is in a unique opportunity to really be a beacon of democracy in the region.\" Tan added: \"Personally, I am very grateful for this open, democratic space that Tun Mahathir’s government has opened and it’s a beacon for many who are struggling for democracy. Not just in Singapore but in other parts of Southeast Asia.” “I think (Singapore) will be very concerned, not because I met with Dr Mahathir, but the fact that the prime minister is prepared to share his views about democracy and to enhance the development of democracy in the region. \"And that Malaysia is now shining this beacon which is probably stealing the limelight from Singapore. I think that’s what worries them. Singapore is becoming (an) outdated, archaic society with its dominant party controls.” In his Facebook post, Mr Seah questioned Dr Thum's invitation to the Malaysian prime minister to \"bring democracy to Singapore\". \"I wonder what deep historical insight prompted him to make this plea, to Dr M, whose views on the Water Agreement with Singapore, and Singapore knowing its place in relation to Malaysia are well known,\" he wrote. \"Is it also a coincidence that they had accompanied Tan Wah Piow on this visit to Dr M? Tan was convicted for rioting in 1975 and slipped out of Singapore upon his release from prison to avoid National Service. Several of Tan’s comrades from that time subsequently joined the CPM’s radio station, Voice of the Malayan Revolution, in Changsha, China. \"Perhaps that is why he thinks it is permissible to ask its current prime minister to interfere in our affairs.\" Mr Seah also added it was interesting that Han, Wham and Liew should \"associate themselves with Thum\". \"Perhaps I should remind PJ Thum that our Constitution requires any change to the sovereignty of Singapore to be approved by two-thirds of all voters in a referendum,\" Mr Seah wrote in his Facebook post. \"This requirement was put in by our founding leaders. As a result of our searing experience in the 23 months when we were part of Malaysia, they knew how important it was to safeguard our independence and sovereignty.\" Mr Seah also pointed out that Singapore's first Minister for Law, Mr EW Barker, who was also the author of the Separation Agreement, said that “in the methodology of the destruction of a nation its foes, war by force of arms is not necessarily the only means employed. The independence of a nation may, by more subtle means, be subverted\". \"He also said 'the seductive blandishments of foreign agents must not be allowed to succeed'. Quite right and I am sure Singaporeans will agree with that,\" added Mr Seah. MR SEAH QUESTIONS TEO SOH LUNG'S COMMENTS Mr Seah also noted that former Internal Security Act (ISA) detainee and former Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Teo Soh Lung made a comment that \"Singapore is part of Malaya\" on a post by The Online Citizen.  \"Really? This is what PJ Thum and Teo Soh Lung and the SDP believe in their heart of hearts?\" Mr Seah said.  \"Note she says 'Malaya', not 'Malaysia'. This was what the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) maintained – that Malaysia was an imperialist plot, and Singapore’s separation and independence was a sham.\" In a Facebook post late on Saturday, the SDP took issue with Mr Seah mentioning the party in his post, given that both Dr Thum and Ms Teo were not members of the SDP.  \"Dr Thum and Ms Teo are not members of the SDP (and) thus do not speak for the party or represent us in any way. \"We did not have anything to do with the meeting nor did we say anything about the matter. We only learnt about Dr Thum's meeting with Dr Mahathir through reports in the media,\" the party wrote.   \"It is, therefore, bewildering that Mr Seah would drag the SDP into the issue. One can only conclude that the PAP (People's Action Party) MP is being cheeky.\"  The SDP added that Mr Seah's \"wild insinuations\" was an attempt to \"divert the people's attention from our message\". \"The SDP will stay focused on our work which is to continue speaking up for our fellow Singaporeans, draw up alternative solutions and work for a better Singapore,\" it said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-does-not-wish-singapore-well-mp-seah-10675180"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 08:40PM", "tags": ["ASEAN", "RCEP", "trade"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "RCEP talks at ‘most challenging stage’ but ‘good progress’ made in Singapore: Chan Chun Sing", "content": " SINGAPORE: The latest round of negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in Singapore made “good progress”, though considerable work remains to reach the goal of “substantially concluding” the trade pact by the end of the year, said Singapore’s Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Saturday (Sep 1).  With talks being at the “most challenging stage”, he urged all 16 member countries to “shoulder the common responsibility” of pushing negotiations past the finish line – potentially by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit that will be hosted by Singapore in November.  “As you get closer to the milestone that you want, the last part is always the most critical because that will require the toughest trade-offs,” Mr Chan said at a press conference to wrap up the annual ASEAN Economic Ministers' (AEM) Meeting held at the Shangri-La Hotel.  Using an analogy from mountain climbing, he added: “As you go nearer to the summit, the climb can become steeper and more challenging so we need to buckle down.” “Negotiations are now at a critical phase, and considerable work remains to be done in the next few months to bring us to a substantial conclusion.”  The latest RCEP negotiations – which involve the 10 ASEAN countries, together with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand – took place as part of the four-day AEM meetings in Singapore.  Talks have been going on since 2013, with four out of 18 chapters concluded thus far. When inked, RCEP will form the world’s largest trading bloc, making up a third of global gross domestic product.  Progress on the proposed trade pact is closely watched amid escalating trade tensions, with several countries going for tit-for-tat measures against tariffs that have been imposed by the United States.  Mr Chan said the latest round of negotiations has made “good progress”, with most participating countries “demonstrating flexibility by accommodating each other’s needs where possible”.  This resulted in the narrowing of gaps and paved the way forward for negotiators to engage on key outstanding issues, he added.  Having a separate meeting for the RCEP ministers in Singapore have been “most useful”.  Mr Chan elaborated: “When the negotiators look at things in silos, it’s hard to break the deadlock but when the ministers sit down together and look at the package holistically, they are able to look at it from a political angle (and) see how they can sell the package to their domestic audience.” He added that the ministers have also displayed openness about potential challenges that they might face domestically.   “Because we are frank with one another, it enables other ministers to try and come together to see how we can help each other … This makes for a better relationship and gives a greater chance for us to get things done collectively,” he told Channel NewsAsia during a separate interview with local media.  Moving forward, all member countries will have to secure the necessary political mandates domestically, while intensifying bilateral negotiations to close existing gaps.  Talks regarding the remaining chapters of the trade pact are also seeing progress, added Mr Chan.  When asked if trade tensions elsewhere have added urgency to the RCEP talks, he replied: “I think all the ministers are very aware and cognizant of the global economic and trade challenges. I’m sure this is on the back of their minds and will add to the energy that they will put into the RCEP process.”  Mr Chan added that ASEAN, together with its RCEP partners, remain believers of a rules-based multilateral system which continues to be “the best way” to overcome challenges, such as technological disruption.  The annual series of meetings, which started on Tuesday, saw ASEAN ministers inking agreements to push for greater integration of the region’s services sectors, as well as reduce administrative hassle and costs for businesses. Apart from RCEP talks, the meetings also included separate consultations with the grouping’s key partners, such as United States, China, Australia, Russia and Canada.  On what these discussions and deals mean for Singapore, Mr Chan said having linkages with different countries will enable local businesses and workers to weather challenges in the global economy.  “We must make sure that we continue to build up our links with more countries … so that our businesses will not face a discontinuity even if there’s a disruption in one particular market.”  Citing the newly signed ASEAN agreements as examples, Mr Chan said the accord to deepen integration in the region’s services sector, for instance, will translate into better opportunities for local firms.  This will, in turn, help to create more job opportunities and better wages for workers here, he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/rcep-talks-challenging-stage-good-progress-made-asean-10674972"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 08:35PM", "tags": ["junior college", "education", "MOE"], "author": "Tan Si Hui", "title": "Merged JCs carry out finishing touches to new college identity and campus", "content": " SINGAPORE: Serangoon Junior College’s (JC) principal Manogaran Suppiah spent the June holidays mulling over the college song for the school he will be heading next year - Anderson Serangoon JC. Mr Suppiah said the lyrics for the song, For the Service of Others, were inspired by the mottos of both the merging schools. “Serangoon’s motto is ‘Discere Servire’ (To learn, to serve) and Anderson’s motto is ‘Non Mihi Solum’ (Not for myself alone). Both have a key idea of serving others,” he said. “My staff here felt that being the first principal for the new college, it will be important to pen the lines, and I see it as an opportunity to provide direction for the college.” Schools that are involved in the first-ever JC mergers next year are putting the final touches on their new college identity. The mergers - involving four pairs of JCs - were first announced in April last year. STUDENTS GET TO DECIDE NEW UNIFORM To come up with a new uniform, Anderson and Serangoon JCs held a uniform design competition that was open to both students and staff. Ten designs were submitted, and three were eventually put to a vote. “I think they see themselves creating history too. Creativity was seen and, most importantly, there was a sense of ownership. It was not just the principal deciding on things – that gave them a lot of stake in the future too,” said Mr Suppiah. Over at Tampines and Meridian JCs, both schools formed a committee to come up with four designs – three sets of two-tone and one set of single-tone uniforms. Dean of JC 2 at Tampines JC, Wendy Goh, who is part of the committee, said different factors were taken into consideration for each design. “For one of the designs, we tried to play with the idea of the combination of blue and light green - Meridian being blue and Tampines being light green. So we put together a combination of a hybrid of the two colours,” Mrs Goh said. Another design opted to use neither school’s colours in the uniform, to evoke the idea of neutrality. Instead, it paired a white top with a khaki-coloured bottom. Both students and staff had the opportunity to vote for the design they liked best, and Mrs Goh revealed that one of the two-tone uniforms is currently the most popular among students. MOST PROGRAMMES TO BE RETAINED Meanwhile, the four schools Channel NewsAsia spoke to said that almost all of their programmes will be retained. All programmes and subjects at Tampines JC such as its Malay Language and Drama electives, as well as Art and China Studies, will be brought over to the merged school at Meridian. Tampines JC principal Pamela Yoong, who will head the merged school, said: “One of our promises is to ensure that students will not feel that any subject is sacrificed or rather, we want them to have options.” To accommodate the new subjects, Meridian JC spent S$300,000 to convert its facilities, such as turning one lecture theatre into a black box and a reading room into an art room. And while Anderson JC has shut down one of its co-curricular activities, wushu, which had a low take-up, it will preserve all of Serangoon JC’s CCAs, such as taekwondo and touch football. With four of the merging schools not taking in new students this year, the other JCs expanded their Year 1 intake. Meridian JC took in 893 students this year, up from 680 in the previous year, while Anderson JC’s Year 1 cohort increased from 660 last year to 852 this year.  This is about a 30 per cent boost for both schools – which also saw a rise in cut-off points as a result. “We were 11 points for the JC2 cohort when they were JC1. The current JC1 cohort is 14 points,” said Meridian JC’s principal Lim Yan Hock. In response to Channel NewsAsia's queries, the Ministry of Education said the increased intake this year is not permanent and is expected to fall as cohort sizes shrink in the next few years. TEACHERS FEEL THE STRETCH But the changes have already brought about challenges. At Anderson JC, teachers have felt the stretch due to the increase in workload as they coordinate and plan a new identity and culture for the school.  Its principal, Tay Lai Ling, said staff were also adjusting to having new colleagues.  Thirty-four Serangoon JC teachers have already moved to Anderson, with more slated to join them next year. “While they get along well, we must always keep an eye on them and get all the teachers to work well in support of the students,” said Ms Tay. She added that communication with external vendors, such as uniform suppliers, also take extra effort, especially when it comes to delivering the uniforms on time. HERITAGE GALLERIES OPENED Ahead of the mergers, the schools have set up a heritage gallery to commemorate their leaders and milestones. The heritage gallery at Meridian JC opened in July, equipped with a digital platform for visitors to scroll through the history of both colleges. It also has a terrarium containing soil dug from both sites, as well as time capsules containing 32 artefacts from Tampines JC and 15 from Meridian JC. The numbers signify the number of years the schools have been in operation. In April, a six-panel heritage wall at Anderson JC was unveiled - with one panel left empty. It will be filled with the next chapter of the schools’ history, following the merger. Some Year 1 students at Anderson JC say it was an honour to be part of the pioneer batch of the merged school next year and were looking forward to it. “Anderson has a more studious culture, and Serangoon has a more relaxed culture. But with both cultures coming together, it will form better programmes for us to enjoy in the future,\" said arts student Valerie Tan.  Echoing the same sentiment, science student Zeph Tan said: “We can expect to see a change in culture. I would say it will be more balanced.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/merged-junior-college-carry-out-finishing-touches--10674528"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 04:24PM", "tags": ["Team Singapore", "Asian Games"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: Singapore performed below expectations, but debutants bring hope", "content": " JAKARTA: Singapore's performance at the 2018 Asian Games was lower than expected, but the contingent's overall medal haul has been buoyed by emerging debutants, said the Singapore Sports Institute's Richard Gordon on Saturday (Sep 1). head of High Performance for Sport and Athlete Life at the Singapore Sport Institute,  Speaking to media at a press conference wrapping the Games for Team Singapore in Indonesia on Saturday (Sep 1), the head of High Performance for Sport and Athlete Life said: \"Overall I think we were lower than our initial expectations. Our expectations were to try and beat the (medal count from the) 2014 Games. We’ve fallen short of that.\" As of Saturday afternoon, Singapore's medal count from Indonesia stood at four golds, four silvers and 14 bronzes. At the last edition of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, Singapore brought home five gold medals, six silvers and 13 bronzes.  \"However, it's not a simple yes or no. We've got to look at the stories behind the medals. We've got look at the stories behind the sports and competition. There were some places where we were up, other places where we were not,\" said Gordon.  Team Singapore chef de mission Lee Wung Yew, however, maintained that the team \"delivered an excellent showing\" at the Games.  \"Our athletes showed no fear coming up against some of the world’s best athletes to fight for every point and victory. With a contingent formed largely of debutants, the results are very encouraging and hopefully, this indicates greater successes for them in the future,\" said the former Olympic shooter.  Lee also announced that Team Singapore were given a \"B\" grade for this edition of the Asian Games.  In spite of the rating, Gordon stressed that the team was going through a transition, particularly with younger athletes emerging to replace established stars.  \"There’ve been very encouraging performances in that regard ... the number of personal bests and national records we have broken by the emerging contingent coming through gives us good grounds for hope,\" said Gordon.   He highlighted that debutants made up 75 per cent of Singapore's contingent and that of the athletes that received a medal, 75 per cent were debutants.  As an example, Lee cited the achievements of the men's contract bridge team that clinched gold, and jujitsu exponent Constance Lien, who clinched silver. He also lauded the silat team, which clinched two silvers and three bronzes at the Games.  When asked about why sports that Singapore were traditionally strong in won fewer medals, Gordon reasoned that the programme in Indonesia for sports like sailing and bowling was different from that at Incheon.  Sailing won a gold and a bronze in Jakarta, a medal haul that paled in comparison with 2014 when the team brought home three golds, two silvers and two bronzes.  \"There have been been significant changes to the (sailing) programme. For example, many of the sailing classes in which we were very successful in 2014 are not in these Games,\" said Gordon. \"For bowling, we’ve seen the reduction in the number of games and that has impacted our team.\"  \"Overall we feel that we have made some progress over 2014, though the headline figures showed we have one gold fewer and ... fewer medals, but its only by a small number,\" he added.  Gordon maintained that the athletes have held up their positive performances from the 2015 SEA Games, and that the team is \"going in the right direction\".  \"This is a long-term project. We know it takes eight to 12 years to develop high-performance athletes. Its not something that's going to change overnight,\" he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/asian-games-singapore-performed-below-expectations-but-debutants-10674362"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 03:36PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Team Singapore", "table tennis"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: Yu Mengyu settles for joint-bronze after table tennis semi-final defeat", "content": " JAKARTA: Singapore table tennis player Yu Mengyu settled for a joint-bronze on Saturday (Sep 1) after losing 4-1 to China's Wang Manyu in the 2018 Asian Games women's singles semi-final.  Yu, who struggled to cope with Wang’s aggressive tactics and quick backhand smashes throughout the encounter, lost the tie 7-11, 6-11, 5-11, 11-9, 7-11.

Speaking at Tengah Air Base, PM Lee, who was the guest of honour at the parade, cited the summit as one of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" that required RSAF officers to answer to the call of duty at short notice.  \"The RSAF showed the world during the Summit that you are operationally ready,\" said Mr Lee. \"You were tasked to defend our skies by forming a protective 'dome' over Singapore.  \"You had more than 20 aircraft in the air or ready to take off, at any moment; more than 10 ground-based air defence systems stood guard, and unmanned aerial vehicles were on standby. This was a live operation, not a dry exercise.\"  Mr Lee noted that the officers had only two weeks to prepare for the historic event and that many had to cancel leave plans and forfeit vacation bookings. \"But you stepped up to the challenge, and showed Singapore and the world your capabilities and dedication,\" he said.  In his speech, the prime minister also raised the \"continuing and unending task\" of making sure Singapore's equipment, technology and systems are up to date.  He said that as the Air Force grew, it improvised with what it had, and progressively built up and renewed its equipment.  \"It must be pursued consistently and resolutely, with adequate resources, conscious of our defence needs and the international context,\" said Mr Lee.  \"We do not simply go for the most expensive and newest. But we always acquire what makes the most operational sense for us. Sometimes, we even buy second-hand equipment, such as the KC-135 air-to-air refuelling tanker aircraft,\" he added.  The parade, which consisted of a marching contingent of almost 500 personnel and flypasts involving 20 aircraft, was held in conjunction with the RSAF’s 50th anniversary.  It also capped off the RSAF’s Golden Jubilee celebrations this year, which began in February with the Singapore Airshow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Other events held earlier this year in the lead up to the parade included live demonstrations, static displays and interactive exhibits at five different locations islandwide as well as the biggest aerial showcase of the year at the RSAF50@Marina Barrage. A display of a blue RSAF50-themed F-15SG kickstarted the parade, wowing a crowd of close to 1,400 guests, including Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen and Chief of Air Force Major General (MG) Mervyn Tan. Bringing together elements of the past, present and future, the parade paid tribute to the forefathers of the RSAF, with a mobile column drive-past featuring pioneer personnel saluting the crowd. Capping off the show was a flypast which involved a sequence of aircraft such as the CH-47 Chinook Helicopter, F-16D+ fighter jets and six F-15SGs. Another highlight for guests was a static display, which included current and retired aircraft. PM Lee was also on hand to view the newest addition to the RSAF’s fleet - the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). The aerial refuelling aircraft arrived in Singapore last month and was making its first public appearance. As part of the celebrations, PM Lee also unveiled the RSAF 50 commemorative mural at a post-parade gallery.  The 10m by 4m canvas mural is a collage of 50,000 photographs collected from members of the public as well as contributors such as President Halimah Yacob and the PM himself. It aims to showcase the achievements of the RSAF over the last 50 years and will be permanently displayed in the Air Force Museum. “It was important for us to have something to hold on to (and) remember what we have done so far,” explained ME 5 Edward Kang, RSAF50 commemorative mural sub-committee chairman. “I hope when Singaporeans see it, they will have the quiet confidence that the RSAF is there for them to defend their skies.”​​​​​​​ “The (parade’s) theme of honouring the past, celebrating the present and inspiring the future is designed to round off the year,” said parade chairman Col Lau Boon Ping. “It is really to describe the journey that we have taken over the past 50 years.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/rsaf50-parade-trump-kim-summit-lee-hsien-loong-10674014"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 09:00AM", "tags": ["RSAF", "Black Knights"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "‘I'd do it again at the drop of a hat': Pioneer fighter pilot looks back on 50 years of the RSAF  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Happily married for 43 years, Colonel (COL) (Ret) Frank Singam is a man who knows a thing or two about falling in love. In fact, the father of two has never forgotten his first crush. The 67-year-old speaks about her with a twinkle in his eye. He has painstakingly kept yellowed pictures of her in a weathered folder, and even entrusted her with his life. \"The Hawker Hunter (the Singapore Air Force's first fighter jet) is my first love. Your first girlfriend will always stay in your heart,\" he explains to Channel NewsAsia with a hearty chuckle. \"I tell my wife that too.\" Mr Singam's meticulously maintained Pasir Ris flat pays homage not just to his favorite aircraft but also to the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), which celebrated its 50th anniversary this weekend. Nine commemorative plaques hang on the wall, mementos to a career which spanned over three decades and saw Mr Singam become one of Singapore’s pioneer fighter pilots as well as a founding member of the Black Knights, the RSAF's official aerobatics team. An extensive career also saw Mr Singam become base commander at the Paya Lebar and Tengah Airbases and participate in numerous overseas exercises, before leaving the RSAF in 2001. HAD TO DO IT  Mr Singam's fascination with flying began as a fresh-faced student at Raffles Institution when he responded to a recruitment advertisement. \"I don't think I really wanted to be a fighter pilot per se, it was (about being) a teacher or a doctor during those times,\" he recalled. \"But when the air force started to recruit in 1968, some of these advertisements appeared in the newspapers ... so I said, 'Why don't I try something new?'\"  The enthusiastic 16-year-old had to get through an interview as well a series of physical and psychomotor tests. \"It was daunting - there were senior guys in the interview panel, they asked some tough questions and of course, you are also sitting there with the other guys who are also competing,\" recalled Mr Singam.  Having passed with flying colors, Mr Singam would become part of an elite group of men. He later found out that out of the 3,000 that applied, only 30 were selected to form the first batch of fighter pilots. But first, the teenager was told that he had to wait a year before he could begin training.    \"They said: 'You're too young and we'll call you next year',\" Mr Singam recalled. \"So I just held my breath for one year, went back to studies and didn't do very well because of the excitement of it all. \"And then exactly one year later, they called me in. They knocked on the door on a Saturday and told me to come in on a Monday. I looked at my dad and he said: 'You go and I'll sort out the principal!'\" FLYING THE COOP First up for Mr Singam was a local month-long \"crash course\" flying a Cessna plane. “It was mentally demanding, there was a lot of anxiety on whether you could do it and then if you pass through every hurdle, your confidence grew,\" he said.  He was then posted to Britain for further training with their Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1969. \"The culture shock took me about six months to get used to,\" he said. \"One of my biggest challenges was that being raised a Hindu, I can't eat beef. But when you go there, three to four meals in a week are beef. The British don't just serve vegetarian meals. I had to look up there (to the heavens) and say sorry but I have to survive!  \"It was all about adjustment, adapting and accommodating.\" Mr Singam also had to come to terms with the sudden death of his father, who suffered a heart attack just one month after he'd departed to the UK. But rather than returning to Singapore, Mr Singam decided to stay the course. \"I talked to my mum and my uncle, they said this was what my father wanted so (I should) stay there. I never saw my family until one and a half years later - when I finished my basic flying,\" he said. As part of his training in the UK, Mr Singam flew different aircraft, such as the Jet Provost and the Hawker Hunter. \"I hadn’t even driven a car and here I was flying an airplane. I just took it on a day-to-day basis, this funny feeling of being airborne,\" explained Mr Singam.  The British-made Hawker Hunter is a favourite among many former pilots, and Mr Singam shares this love for the jet. \"You had to climb out at a particular speed but because you had to go so fast, you couldn't control the speed. We were like aiming for the skies, like a rocket taking off. That was how scary it was. It was so fast, no simulator training could have prepared you for this except what the trainers were telling you,\" he recalled. \"The aircraft was just running away from us, we left our brains behind. So you slowly catch up with it and bring it under control. After this first flight, it was all okay.\"  AIMING FOR THE SKIES Returning to Singapore in 1971 after the completion of his training, Mr Singam had to prove himself in an operational environment for six months. \"The work was not done yet, you come back as an 'unoperational' pilot,\" he said. \"The demands on you now become higher, it's not academic anymore. It's not just aircraft application but mission application.\" A 20-year-old Mr Singam became part of the RSAF's pioneer batch of fighter pilots and he made history again two years later, when he volunteered to become its first aerobatics team -  the Black Knights, which were formed in 1973. \"They went around and asked everybody (who would like to join) - but formation aerobatics is not everybody's cup of tea,\" recalled Mr Singam. \"Some people would just like to fly solo aerobatics, but formation, when you have to depend entirely on the leader and your other wing men, is a different kettle of fish.\" Inspired by the Red Arrows, the RAF's aerobatics team, Mr Singam signed up without a second thought. \"I was the only one (in my squadron that volunteered) ... I always wanted to grow as a pilot and I never looked back after I said yes,\" he added. BLACK KNIGHTS IN SHINING ARMOUR  Mr Singam had done formation flying in the past, but becoming one of the Black Knights' first four members was an eye-opener. \"When you finish a training session with the Black Knight team, you're mentally exhausted,\" he explained. \"Because the focus and the concentration (needed) is absolutely high. When you are doing formation acrobatics, as soon as you let your concentration off, you will lose the line - your position and you will make it very difficult for the other guy. \"Your hands get very tired, because you're holding (the stick and throttle) so tight. You think the harder you hold, the better the control. But just the opposite, you should just relax,\" added Mr Singam.    Sessions were usually limited to one a day, with breaks of four to five hours between practices - should there be the need for more than one session.  \"This was on top of our normal flying (duties). So you need to have a senior pilot to be able to absorb that load,\" added Mr Singam. \"But it was fun, anytime you fly it is fun - no matter how tired you are.\" Mr Singam went on to serve five tours with the Black Knights, leading two of them in 1977 and 1978. The Black Knights would execute flypasts at events such as SAF Day and National Day Parades. Performing at these showcases was taken very seriously. \"You cannot afford to get sick. If you don't turn up it can be only because of a technical malfunction. So you have to look after yourself, if the wife has a flu, you tell her to sleep in another room,\" he added with a laugh. \"We are the ambassadors of the Air Force... It's not just to show your own people that you have an Air Force that's professional and can do this kind of stuff. For all those who could be looking at us and could be a potential threat, they also know that you don't mess around with this Air Force.\" The Black Knights would go on to use the F-5 and A-4SU Skyhawk planes, and Mr Singam went on to contribute to these teams later in his flying career. FLYING THE FLAG Despite clocking more than 3,000 hours of flights throughout his career, detailed in a meticulously pristine logbook, the completion of every successful flight was significant, said Mr Singam. \"Every time you land, there's relief. Because you never know what's going to happen when you go airborne. Anything can happen,\" he said. Now a counsellor, Mr Singam looks back on his storied career with fond memories. He may have left the force - but his love for flying does not seem to have diminished. Flying memorabilia take a place of pride in Mr Singam's home. Throughout the interview, he illustrates some of his points on a miniature replica of the Hawker Hunter, even serving drinks to visitors on glassware adorned with aircraft such as Spitfires.   \"It was a duty bestowed on us. We were very honoured to take it on and we were privileged to work there so that the Air Force, the community and ultimately, the country benefited from it,\" he reflected.  \"I would do it again at the drop of a hat. It was absolutely awesome.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/i-d-do-it-again-at-the-drop-of-a-hat-pioneer-fighter-pilot-looks-10671060"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["housing", "public housing", "HDB", "NDR", "BTO", "VERS"], "author": "Sing Tien Foo", "title": "Commentary: A tale of one HDB flat across two generations", "content": " SINGAPORE: The redevelopment of ageing properties is an important stage in the life cycle of urbanised cities with limited land supply. For a small country like Singapore, when houses built in the country’s early years age, redevelopment becomes increasingly pertinent both from an economic and urban renewal perspective. Ageing houses, if not redeveloped, have significant implications for the community and individuals due to changing demographic, lifestyle and housing needs. WHEN THE STARS ALIGN FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR For a typical family of two parents with two children living in a typical 4-room flat, after both kids get married, set up their families and move out of the flat, their parents end up with two excess rooms in their flat. Daily chores of upkeeping their flats may unnecessarily strain the old couple who would be in their fifties or sixties by then. So right-sizing to a smaller flat is an attractive option to monetise their large flat and supplement their financial needs, especially after retirement. The option works perfectly well, if the balance lease of their flat is still relatively long and can fetch a good price from a buyer with the requisite financing. This scenario holds in the case where they bought the flat directly from HDB at the age of 25 and retire at the age of say 65. By then, their house will be around 45 years old, taking into account the construction and waiting time of approximately five years, with a balance lease of around 54 years. However, if the parents choose to continue to live in their flat until their last days, they may sell it to the Government through the Lease Buyback Scheme and have some money for their golden years. If they don’t, their children may inherit the old flat after their parents pass on with a balance lease of around 30 or less years, but choose to sell it off. After all, the flat value is likely to depreciate as it reaches the tail-end of the lease term and will ultimately be returned together with the land to the state, when the lease expires. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? But should their children wait until the lease runs out? Some say why not, for they may be picked for the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (SERS). But supposing they don’t, most older flats with a short balance lease are unlikely to command premiums in the resale market. Any potential buyer will probably only pay for the use value of the flat taking into account the remaining lease term. The family should also bear in mind that SERS has only applied to only approximately 4 per cent of the HDB flats with significant redevelopment potential, conditioned on there being sufficient space for replacement flats to be built nearby. Many say despite the small chance for SERS, a large number of buyers will still flock to the resale market to pay high prices for old flats in good locations – but this is a scenario that will be less likely in the future. Why? Ever since Minister of National Development Lawrence Wong tackled this issue of irrational housing choices made by some buyers in a Facebook post last year and explicitly mentioned that land on which leases have expired will be returned to the Government, the ground has shifted. The issue of decaying HDB leases has remained in the spotlight since, and public housing’s relationship to Singapore’s social compact further complicates the issue. Heated debates among parties have ensued, between cynics who place little hope on possible government intervention and others who hold onto unrealistic expectations hoping that the Government would at least dole out some “candies” when HDB flat leases expire. CLEARING THE AIR ON LEASE EXTENSION Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has cleared the air at the National Day Rally with the announcement of the expanded Home Improvement Programme (HIP II) and Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) in dealing with this hot-button issue. PM Lee explained in great length why lease extension is not an economically sustainable solution, consistent with the notion of “sustainable development” defined in the United Nation’s Report of the World Commission on Environmental and Development (1987) - that is:  Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Lease extension is not a desirable answer to the paradox of ageing flats and a longstanding social compact of housing as a form of social security from the perspective of urban land use and preserving economic value. Land reclamation is not a panacea to land scarcity problems in many countries, including Singapore. Long-term land-use planning is necessary to ensure that there is sufficient land for future land use and housing needs. Lease extension without intensification of use impedes the long-term growth of a city. It foils land optimisation, prevents new, innovative land uses and leaves open questions about the quality of land use. If old, low-density housing blocks are preserved through lease extension, more land must be sourced for new public housing flats to meet the growing demand by residents including supporting infrastructure for any new towns like roads, sewerage system, and amenities such as schools, markets and neighbourhood shops. There are also limits to the heritage argument of conserving huge swaths of homogenous HDB flats which might have little unique architectural features.  While some might argue for the need to keep some older HDB flats to preserve the unique charm and character of HDB neighbourhoods, maintaining these HDB blocks, which were in all likelihood built to last for as long as their leases, will come at a higher cost with time, and strain residents and public coffers. The last anyone wants is for beloved HDB flats to become liabilities. Old and dilapidated buildings could choke off urban revitalisation, which runs counter to sustaining a modern city. Functional and economic obsolescence may also set in earlier, due to changing lifestyle and demographics. While smart home features may appeal to younger, more tech savvy families, it’s fixtures like non-slip floor tiles, grab bars, ramp that are more useful when people age. BACK TO THE FUTURE Back to our family of two parents whose kids have moved out. If the parents want to age in their homes, but don’t want to subscribe to the Lease Buyback Scheme, there are now safeguards in place to help cushion that scenario. Though details are pending, the newly proposed VERS may allay their concerns of lease decaying, giving an option for HDB residents to vote to return their balance leases to the government. But it depends on whether their neighbours say yes too. HIP II, on the other hand, will help improve and rectify common wears-and-tears, and provide them with a living space that is safe, secure and pleasant, even after 60 years.  Most importantly, the Government’s stand on not pursuing lease extension is firm and clear, and serves as a forewarning to those buying older flats that the Government has no intention of granting an extension of lease. So that should moderate the property market. MINDSET CHANGE NEEDED Perhaps the issue is a need for a change in people’s notions of public housing. One should be mindful of the goals of public housing - that is to promote homeownership while ensuring their affordability and sustainability. Public housing, in the form of BTO flats, have aimed to provide a lifetime’s home to one household at a time – and the moves at the National Day Rally have served to reinforce this objective in the face of expiring leases. If public housing is exploited for private benefit, and home buyers continue to speculate in old flats, future generations may have to bear the effects of higher housing prices, as land resources are gradually depleted over time.

But on Sunday during a trip to Labrador Park, I was intrigued by a signpost pointing towards the creek and decided to investigate.  If you’ve never been there, you’re missing out on an opportunity to enjoy a peaceful oasis smack in the middle of the urban sprawl around that stretch of West Coast Highway. A few steps from Labrador Park MRT station is the start of a boardwalk that runs alongside the creek for a kilometre, with a couple of viewing platforms along the way.  Thick foliage provides some shade, but there are still plenty of gaps through which to gaze at the slow-moving, clear water, which is home to fish and other aquatic creatures. The final treat is reaching the end of the boardwalk, where the wooded area suddenly opens out to a vast expanse of sea and sky, with a clear view to Sentosa and beyond.  Buffeted by a cooling sea breeze, standing there enjoying the sights, sounds and smells of this location was a reminder that, despite its size, Singapore is blessed with pockets of natural loveliness that are all too readily dismissed by some and ignored by many.  Indeed, the delights of this little walk should make it very popular, but I was almost alone for the 45 minutes I spent there before heading into Labrador. All I had for company was a couple of joggers, a family with a toddler in a stroller and a spritely old uncle, who greeted me with an enthusiastic wave and a cheery “hello” as he enjoyed his afternoon constitutional.  The lack of big crowds at some nature spots has been a constant theme in recent weeks when I have visited parts of Singapore that I am less familiar with.  Bored of always running at MacRitchie or Bedok reservoirs and tired of walking at Bukit Timah Hill (all of which seem busy during the weekend), over the past couple of months I have set out to explore some other natural charms with a fresh pair of eyes, adopting the mindset of a new visitor rather than someone who’s been here almost 20 years.  And what a revelation it has been.  From Coney Island to Sungei Buloh and all points between, Singapore is teeming with beautiful parks, vistas and green spots that never fail to delight.  Among the highlights for me was walking at Kranji Reservoir at dusk and seeing a big bird of prey (I’m not sure which type) swoop down on the still waters to scoop out a large fish for its dinner.  Then there was the long walk around Coney Island and Punggol, ending at the Lorong Halus Wetland.  The attractions of Punggol have hit the headlines recently after being mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally. If you haven’t been there, I recommend that you go. Only by visiting can one appreciate how pleasant it is, with its extensive network of waterways, bridges and paths.  Visits to both locations were significant for their lack of visitors. On a Sunday afternoon – peak time to explore – crowds were thin on the ground. At Lorong Halus Wetland – another location whose existence had passed me by – I was almost alone.  On the upside, this meant I could enjoy a peaceful stroll among the ponds and plants. On the downside, it seemed a shame that more people weren’t there to share its green gorgeousness.  So, if it’s been a while since you set out to explore Singapore’s natural attractions, especially some of the more recent additions, then maybe head out this weekend. Pick somewhere you’ve never been to before or haven’t visited for a long time and go and take a look.  While the place you visit might not have the “wow” factor of some of the world’s greatest natural wonders, I guarantee it will please the eye and soothe the soul, offering some much-needed respite from the daily pressures of city life.  As Ferris Bueller says:  Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. And sometimes getting stuck in a routine means we don’t venture forth to explore what is on our doorstep. If that applies to you, get out and about.  Sniff the fresh air. Have a nose around a nature reserve. Take a peek at some unfamiliar parks.  You won’t regret it.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/nature-parks-singapore-berlayer-creek-wildlife-10663058"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 06:27AM", "tags": ["Subway", "Halal"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Subway says it will win over customers who doubted its decision to go halal", "content": " SINGAPORE: When Subway Singapore announced on Friday evening (Aug 31) that it was officially halal certified, the online reaction was intense.  Many people expressed strong support for the sandwich chain's decision, but others protested that going halal had removed their favourite pork and bacon options from Subway's menu. But the company saw this coming. Subway's Southeast Asia country director Mr Samad Mohd Shariff told Channel NewsAsia in an interview before Friday's announcement that there was \"bound to be initial apprehension\" over its halal certification.  \"We respect all our consumers. There's bound to be a difference of opinion somehow, especially with social media, but we are quite confident that going halal was the right business decision,\" said Mr Shariff.  He added that when Subway announced last March that the company would no longer serve pork products, there was \"initial feedback\" against the decision. But he maintained that this died down and is confident that those who have spoken out most strongly, threatening to take their business elsewhere, can be won over.   \"Once our consumers realise that we have maintained the same high standard quality, the same freshness, the same taste, I'm very confident they will come back to experience Subway - sooner or later.  \"But of course there's bound to be initial apprehension over what we are doing. I would like to assure anyone that we are going through a whole really meticulous process to ensure our product quality (remains at a similarly high level)\" said Mr Shariff.  \"Again what we would like to assure our regular customers is that the taste remains the same, the same high quality standard is actually maintained in all of (the outlets).\" 'THE WHOLE OF SINGAPORE CAN BUY FROM US'  Mr Shariff stressed that Subway's motivation in going halal was inclusiveness, highlighting that the biggest advantage was that as many people as possible will be able to eat its food.  \"Once we're halal certified, literally the whole of Singapore can buy from us,\" he said. \"The big picture is to get the majority of Singapore to experience Subway - there is bound to be some people whose palates may prefer things which are different, but we are working on a bigger piece of Singapore.\" As part of its process to meet the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) requirements for halal certification, Subway had to work on three points - conduct ritual cleansing for all its restaurants, ensure it has at least two Muslim employees at each outlet and ensure that all the protein-based food in its products is halal certified.  Ritual cleansing, which is known in Islam as sertu, involves the process of washing the Subway kitchens and restaurants. Subway said it hired an external contractor to cleanse all its outlets in March.  According to Mr Shariff, the part of the process that required Subway to take \"quite some time\" was to ensure its meat products fulfilled MUIS' requirements. Subway had to use alternative ingredients for some of its sandwiches. For instance, the protein products in its cold cut trio, meatball marinara melt as well as steak and cheese were all changed to halal-certified options.  Meanwhile, for its sandwiches that previously used pork or bacon, chicken or beef alternatives have been used.  Mr Shariff stressed that the journey towards halal certification has been meticulous because it wanted to preserve the quality of the product.  When asked about challenges that Subway faced in its journey, Mr Shariff said: \"Any process this large bounds to have some bumps along the way but I'd say that they're small bumps, not big bumps. \"Generally we maintained the mindset that the (quality of the) product needed to be maintained. We needed to go through the MUIS halal compliant process and it is a process we managed to pull through,\" he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/subway-says-it-will-win-over-customers-who-doubted-its-decision-10672552"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 06:19AM", "tags": ["domestic helpers", "maids"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "The helpers’ helper: From suicidal maid in Singapore to devoted social worker in Batam", "content": " BATAM: Her journey began in a dark place of suicidal thoughts and led to death witnessed first-hand, but these days Rahayu Gabrelle’s exploits involve bringing light into the lives of those who tread the path she once did. The 42-year-old Indonesian runs Yayasan Dunia Viva Wanita, a Batam island-based non-profit foundation and shelter for women, children and migrant workers hailing from nearby regions in Indonesia as well as Singapore and Malaysia. Yet at the turn of the noughties Rahayu, who is married with a child, was the one seeking shelter instead as a domestic helper in Singapore. She declined to go into detail but was visibly distressed when harking back to the nine-month stint with her first employer there. “I had some problems, some abuse,” the reticent woman told Channel NewsAsia in hesitant English. “I felt very depressed … They didn’t let me go out at all, and sometimes I would think, maybe it would be better to kill myself.” Fortunately, Rahayu asked for a transfer instead and over the next four years found better luck working for a “very nice” employer. She was unaware, though, that it was illegal for her to help out at their dry-cleaning shop - so when Manpower Ministry (MOM) personnel came along “pretending to be customers”, the gig was up.    Rahayu was placed at a shelter run by HOME (Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics), where she met the non-governmental body’s founder Bridget Tan for the first time. “At the shelter I had nothing to do, and I saw Sister Bridget being very busy buying food, running around every day - so I volunteered to help,” said Rahayu. “Then after my case was concluded, she asked me if she were to open a shelter in Batam, could I take care of it for her? But I’m from Central Java, so I said ‘no’ because I had also heard that Batam is known for having many sex workers.” So Rahayu went home first - but while visiting Tan in Singapore a year later in 2007, a fateful incident changed her mind for good. “We were just walking to the HOME shelter when a domestic worker - Indonesian - fell from 14 storeys up,” Rahayu recalled, adding she had no idea if it was an accident or otherwise. “I saw all the blood, the police carrying the body away … Then I turned to Sister Bridget and said OK, I will do the job.” MISSING PAY, UNWANTED BABIES AND MORE Viva Wanita was up and running by 2009 and since then, Tan has remained in a consulting role, with her own house in Batam serving as the shelter itself. Their doors are often open to women from other parts of Indonesia, sent to Batam with the promise of a well-paid factory job but ultimately exploited and forced into the sex trade, said Rahayu. But she noted that the major group continues to be that of Indonesian, Filipino and Burmese domestic helpers repatriated from Singapore and Malaysia - women “worse” off than she once was. Asked about some of the common plights faced by the domestic helpers sent to her shelter from Singapore, Rahayu said many were owed their salaries, in particular those with multiple transfers to different employers. “We also have many cases of unplanned pregnancies by Bangladeshi workers,” she added. “The woman comes to us, the baby is born here and we try to get them to her family. But some are not ready to do that - for many traditional families, to be pregnant before marriage is a sin. “So we help them explain to their families, or let them wait here until the families understand.” Then there are the Indonesian domestic helpers - who make up over half of Singapore’s population of maids - sent to Batam at the end of their employment, despite not originally hailing from there to begin with. “KEEP GOING” Under Singaporean regulations, employers must pay for their return trip home but as previously reported by the international Human Rights Watch group, some opt to purchase cheap ferry tickets to Batam instead of flights to an airport nearest to their hometown. MOM guidelines stipulate that alternative repatriation arrangements can only be made if both employer and domestic worker agree to it. The ministry also has a compulsory orientation programme for first-time maids, and sends out newsletters to reach out to them. Citing the need for confidentiality, Rahayu did not share personal information of the domestic helpers in the above cases, but confirmed that some of them had lodged reports with MOM. In total, 323 cases were handled by Viva Wanita from 2011 to 2017 - a number which Rahayu said she would be glad to see fall further. “Have we helped people? I think so. When I started, we would get about 80 domestic helpers coming from Singapore,” she said. “It’s better now. In one year we get maybe 20.” The foundation has only two other staffers - with one part-time - but on the squatter outskirts of Batam city, nearly 20 teachers employed to provide free education to 250 kindergarten and primary school kids spread throughout five schools. Rahayu called this a necessary initiative - but one that comes at no small expense, along with the frequent purchases of flight tickets to send domestic helpers back to their rightful homes. “I try to do proposals every year, for both the Indonesia government and private companies to fund us,” said Rahayu. She receives no salary for her efforts - not that it’s an issue for her. “Of course everyone needs money. But with non-profit work, we don’t think of money,” she laughed. “Most important is to run the organisation from year to year; to keep going and going - for all the women and kids that need help.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/from-suicidal-maid-to-social-worker-singapore-batam-10671462"}, {"datetime": "01 Sep 2018 05:02AM", "tags": ["White House", "ASEAN"], "author": "", "title": "Trump to skip Asian regional summits, Pence to travel instead", "content": " WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will not attend regional summits with Asian allies in November but will send Vice-President Mike Pence instead, the White House announced Friday (Sep 1).

Authorities are also investigating 13 men and five women, aged between 17 and 67, after a two-day operation against scammers and money mules.  SUSPECTS BELIEVED TO HAVE OPENED BANK ACCOUNTS FOR LOAN SHARKS Of those suspected of loan-sharking activities, 16 are believed to be runners who had carried out automated teller machine (ATM) transfers on behalf of loan sharks, and two other suspects are believed to have provided false contact information for purpose of obtaining loans. Another suspect is believed to have assisted the loan sharks in issuing loans, police said.  The remaining 77 suspects are believed to have opened bank accounts and given away their ATM cards and personal identification numbers to loan sharks to facilitate their unlicensed moneylending businesses. Investigations against all the suspects are ongoing. Anyone who allows their bank account or ATM card to be used to facilitate unlicensed moneylending is presumed to have assisted in the business, the police said. First-time offenders may be jailed for up to four years, fined between S$30,000 and S$300,000, and caned.  First-time offenders found guilty of acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender, committing or attempting to commit any acts of harassment may be jailed for up to five years, fined and caned. In addition, any person guilty of providing false contact information to obtain loans from loan sharks faces up to 12 months in jail, while anyone who fails to report a change of address may be jailed for up to five years and fined.

The 50-year-old was given an additional 12 weeks' jail in lieu of caning, as he cannot be caned because of his age. The accused and the school cannot be named in order to protect the identities of the boys, who were aged between 14 and 16 at the time of the crimes. The counsellor, who has been suspended since 2013, committed the offences between 2011 and 2013. The prosecution said he was a dedicated counsellor whom the school community liked and trusted. However, his role gave him access to several troubled and vulnerable male students who, according to the prosecution, often looked up to the accused as the \"sole adult figure in their lives whom they could rely on or turn to\". HE MOLESTED THE BOYS IN HIS COUNSELLING ROOM, WHICH HAD WINDOW BLINDS The accused had a counselling room to himself, with blinds on the windows and a door that could be locked, the prosecution noted. It was here that he molested the three boys.  According to court documents, two of the boys were referred for counselling in 2010, when they were 13 and in Secondary 1. One of the boys was referred for academic difficulties, gaming habits as well as problems with his family, particularly with his mother. The other boy had behavioural issues, ranging from fighting to being rude to teachers. The accused was their counsellor from 2010 to 2013 and he quickly built rapport with them. They saw him in his counselling room during curriculum time, during recess or after school. \"Both victims grew to depend on the accused for advice on how to manage academic stress, difficulties with their teachers, family problems, and even monetary issues,\" said the prosecution. The accused molested the third boy in 2013 when they were talking in the counselling room about one of the other boys' results. According to this boy's evidence, he was not personally counselled by the accused, but was close to the other boy. He said the accused had called him into his counselling room in August 2013. The man then unbuckled and unzipped the boy's pants while continuing to speak to him, before molesting him. He found out later when talking to his friend that the same thing had happened to him. The prosecution said the accused was able to get away with his actions for several years \"because of the trust reposed in him\". The victims were also \"too ashamed to come forward\" or felt they would not be believed. \"It was only on the three victims' coming together and realising the extent of the accused's offending, and the fact that they were not alone in the depredations carried out upon them, that the matter was revealed to the school authorities and investigations commenced,\" said prosecutors Charlene Tay and Yvonne Poon during the 20-day trial. The man was convicted of five outrage of modesty charges in June this year. He was acquitted of two other charges by the judge who deemed the evidence confusing and unreliable. ACCUSED WAS A CARING COUNSELLOR: DEFENCE His defence lawyers Melanie Ho and Tang Shangwei said their client, who is married with two children, was a \"caring counsellor\". Ms Ho said that two of the victims had themselves \"confirmed that (the accused) was still a positive note in each of their lives\". The defence also presented testimonials from students who said the accused was patient and helped them with their difficulties. Ms Ho said that her client \"has already been adequately punished\", as about five years had passed since the police report was first made in 2013. She asked for a sentence of 14 months, while the prosecution pressed for 43 months, with three of those in lieu of caning. After sentencing, Ms Ho told District Judge Tan Jen Tse that her client intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence. The judge offered the accused bail pending appeal of S$20,000.

These were some of the experiences the Home United team had in North Korea during their trip to play the second leg of the AFC Cup Inter Zone play-off semi-final against April 25 Sports Club. The Protectors lost the game, which was played on Tuesday (Aug 28), by a 9-1 scoreline to lose the tie 11-1 on aggregate.  Calling the experience \"weird\" several times, Home's head coach Aidil Sharin told Channel NewsAsia on Friday that it was one that the entire team could learn from.  The team, of which 15 out of 18 players are Muslims, did not have proper meals throughout the six-day trip, as they were not served the halal meals which they had requested from the club.  \"They didn't have a chef who knew how to cook halal meals. They just catered whatever food they had for us,\" said Aidil about arrangements at the Sosan Hotel, where the team was staying.  \"It was difficult for the players to have meat, because it needed to be halal. The players ended up eating just rice and vegetables during mealtimes and that wasn't ideal.  \"Some of the players weren't eating at mealtimes too.\" In the end, the players relied on canned food and cup noodles that they brought with them on the trip instead. \"It's not wise for your players to have that kind of food daily ... but you can't really stop them. Otherwise, how are they going to have the energy to play?\" Aidil said.  Home United's captain Izzdin Shafiq added that the whole team did not eat much on the trip. \"They even served pork for our meals. We definitely can't eat that,\" he said.  The team was also served pork biscuits as part of their pre-match high tea meal.  \"In other countries, there's always snacks and hot coffee. We asked for sandwiches, fruits and hot coffee, but they provided canned milk coffee that was cold. \"When we reached the dressing room, they provided pork biscuits. Some of them took it and vomited,\" said Aidil, noting that the team only realised it contained pork after its South Korean player, Song Ui-young, read the list of ingredients.  STRINGENT CHECKS Aidil also said that he had his laptop seized at Pyongyang International Airport, following the 18-hour journey from Singapore, which included a transit stop in Beijing.  In the laptop was footage of the first-leg match Home United played against April 25 at the Jalan Besar Stadium. He had several videos cut so that he could prepare his players for the match in Pyongyang.  However, Aidil said he was singled out at the airport and had a \"100 per cent search\" done on him.  The laptop and a USB thumb drive, which contained a Malay movie, were found on him and subsequently seized. The items were only returned when the team flew out of Pyongyang.  \"Without the laptop, it was like we were totally handicapped. The videos were to show the players the areas they could improve upon and what to expect from their opponents in the next game,\" said Aidil.  Izzdin meanwhile, added that South Korean Song also had his book confiscated at Customs, where the team took about one hour to clear.  \"It is something new to us, something totally different which we never expected,\" the Singapore international said.  \"We had to surrender our phones; they checked our luggage, but I have no idea what they were looking for.\" Their mobile phones and tablets were also subjected to checks during their stay; one of the checks on a club official's laptop and hard disk took as long as 20 minutes.  The team also thought they had lost their yoga mats in transit, until midfielder M Anumanthan, who arrived in Pyongyang four days later, saw them at the baggage area together with his luggage.  Communication also became an issue for the team in North Korea, as the players had no access to wifi or the Internet - which meant that they could not communicate as they normally would have on overseas trips.  \"We are used to having wifi and this trip we didn't have it,\" said Aidil. \"The TV had only four to five channels, and none of them was in English. We couldn't do anything in the hotel ... it was just eating, resting and sleeping.\"  The team was also afraid of heading out of the hotel, as they \"feared for their safety\".  Song was also followed everywhere - even to the souvenir shop at the hotel - by men who appeared to be from the police. The Sosan Hotel apparently only had one functioning lift during the team's stay, according to Aidil. Home United were given rooms on the 26th and 27th floor, and when club officials asked why they could not stay at a lower level, hotel employees said it was because they were \"full house\".  \"But it was really weird, because when we were there, we saw it was just us and a few other Koreans,\" said Aidil. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/afc-cup-home-united-north-korea-april-25-10670970"}, {"datetime": "31 Aug 2018 04:39PM", "tags": ["drugs", "CNB"], "author": "", "title": "82 arrested over 4 days in islandwide drug bust: CNB", "content": " SINGAPORE:  A three-month-old girl was found in a unit along with two suspected drug offenders when officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) raided a unit at Telok Blangah Crescent on Wednesday (Aug 29).

He was speaking at the Food Services Transformation Conference, held at the Asian Culinary Institute.  The event is aimed at encouraging food businesses to adopt technology and digitalisation as a key means to meet the challenges of manpower constraints and rising costs within the sector. Mr Chee said the appropriate use of technology can help improve various processes in food services, ranging from customer relations to inventory and procurement processes. However, he also warned of the pitfalls of chasing technology blindly, citing a personal experience he had at a bak kut teh restaurant that used e-menus via tablets.  “When a tablet was not working, either because the system hanged or someone accidentally spilt soup on it, customers could not sit at that table because there was no alternative channel to order their food,” Mr Chee said. “Like all tools, we need to apply technology smartly to support new business models and process re-engineering. The objective is not to chase technology as an end in itself.” He also gave a positive example of Creative Eateries, a company which has implemented a digital internal system to facilitate the ordering of ingredients such as sauces, soups and par-cooked meat from the central kitchen.  This allows the company to better predict production levels and tap on live information on inventory levels, which has led to better management of product shelf-life and lower storage costs. The push for greater technology adoption comes as food services remain a key part of Singapore’s economy.  In 2016, the sector contributed almost S$9 billion in operating receipts and contributed over 180,000 jobs. A number of upcoming technology trends relevant to the F&B industry were also showcased as part of the conference. This includes the Kawada robot, which can take customers’ food orders.  The robot's programme software was developed by a team from Nanyang Polytechnic’s (NYP) School of Engineering, with the long-term goal for it to be used in real-world restaurants.  NYP is also working with China tech firm IIM on a facial recognition service robot that is able to give customer food recommendations based on certain aspects of a person's profile such as age and gender.  Other restaurant-related technology include a cashless self-service payment kiosk, as well as Dining Butler, which is a mobile ordering solution for customers to place their food orders directly on their own devices. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/food-services-industry-needs-to-be-smart-about-embracing-10670990"}, {"datetime": "31 Aug 2018 12:34PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Father of three gets 14 years' jail, 24 strokes of the cane for sexually assaulting son's friend ", "content": " SINGAPORE: A foreign executive was sentenced on Friday (Aug 31) to 14 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane for sexually assaulting a nine-year-old boy during a Halloween sleepover in 2015. The 48-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, had claimed trial. He was found guilty in high court earlier this month of two charges of sexual assault, and one charge of aggravated outrage of modesty of the boy, who was his son's friend. He had molested the victim after 11pm on Oct 31, 2015, while the boy was sleeping on the upper bunk of a bed in the accused's home. The man's own son was sleeping on the lower bunk. The father of three sexually assaulted the young boy by performing oral sex on him. The boy told his father what happened and a police report was made a few days later. ACCUSED SUFFERED HARDSHIP WHILE IN REMAND: DEFENCE In court on Friday, the accused's defence lawyer Selva K Naidu described the \"hardship\" that the man had suffered while in remand, as his bail had been revoked upon his conviction. He said that the man, who sat in the dock with a neck brace, was admitted to Changi General Hospital for a week for an old spinal injury. He added that the accused was unable to attend a previous hearing earlier this month for the sentencing as his blood pressure had gone up. The spinal injury, as well as a related neck injury, stemmed from a 2011 accident when the accused fell from an elephant, Mr Naidu told reporters. Justice See Kee Oon, in delivering his judgment, said he was \"unable to discern any relevant mitigating factors\" in the case. This, despite Mr Naidu's previous argument that the victim could have been hallucinating due to the \"scary\" nature of Halloween and the amount of candy he consumed. He also was not persuaded by Mr Naidu's submission that only one offence was committed in respect of two of the charges. In delivering the sentence for caning, he noted that it was capped at 24 strokes, and addressed the defence's point that the accused may be unfit for caning due to his injuries. \"Should prisons assess that he is unfit to be caned, the matter will be referred to again,\" said Justice See. He denied the defence's application for bail pending an appeal, as the accused intends to appeal against conviction.

In contrast, total travel demand increased by five per cent in the period to 15.4 million journeys in 2017. The four-yearly survey which was conducted between August 2016 and May 2017, also pointed out that resident household car ownership fell 39 per cent compared to 46 per cent in the previous survey. The decline pointed to a possible shift of Singapore residents switching from private vehicles to public transport for their daily commute, said LTA.  \"This coincided with significant improvements in public transport and the rise of the use of private hire cars instead of personal cars over the same period,\" it added.  The number of commuters who took public transport during peak periods increased from 63 to 67 per cent, putting Singapore firmly on track to achieve the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) target set in 2013 of having 75 per cent of all journeys during peak hours made using public transport by 2030, the transport authority said.  LTA also said that the daily train journeys grew from 2.3 million in 2012 to 2.7 million in 2016. This was due to the opening of the Circle Line and Downtown Line, as well as the addition of around 200 new trains to augment the capacity of Singapore's rail network.  The number of daily bus journeys also grew from 3.2 million to 3.4 million in the same period, on the back of initiatives such as the S$1.1 billion Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) which saw 1,000 new buses and 80 new bus routes added.  LTA added that the BSEP boosted the capacity of about 70 per cent of bus services through the deployment of higher-capacity buses and more frequent bus trips by the time the programme was completed in 2017.  The percentage of daily public bus and rail journeys under 20km completed within 60 minutes increased from 76 per cent in 2012 to 79 per cent in 2016. LTA said it is on track to achieve its LTMP 2013 target of having 85 per cent of such journeys completed within 60 minutes by 2030.  LTA also said that the number of daily journeys made by taxi and private hire cars increased from 0.8 million in 2013 to 1 million in 2017, due to the emergence of private hire cars. The increase in the number of cycling towns, as well as the ongoing expansion of the network of sheltered walkways and cycling paths have also helped make walking, cycling and the use of personal mobility devices (PMDs) viable modes for short journeys.

The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) on Friday (Aug 31) issued its enhanced advisory guidelines following the close of the public consultation last December. It said that under the updated guidelines, organisations can collect, use or disclose NRIC numbers or copies of the NRIC only under certain specific circumstances. First, if they are required by the law or deemed necessary to accurately verify one’s identity to a “high degree of fidelity”, the PDPC said in its press release. For example, a telco will continue to be allowed to keep a record or scanned copy of subscribers’ NRICs, as it is legally required to maintain a register of customers, the agency explained. The second exception is when failing to provide NRIC details could pose a significant safety or security risk, or may pose a risk of significant impact or harm to an individual and the organisation, it added. These could be transactions relating to healthcare or real estate matters like insurance applications and claims. Another example of this exception would be when stores that sell cigarettes have to ask consumers for their NRIC to verify that they meet the minimum legal age for buying the product, PDPC said. It did add that organisations should be able to justify why they are collecting NRIC numbers when asked by individuals or the PDPC. “The NRIC number is a permanent and irreplaceable identifier which can be used to unlock large amounts of information relating to an individual,” the data privacy watchdog said. “In today’s digital economy, indiscriminate collection or negligent handling of NRIC numbers can increase the risk of unintended disclosure and may result in NRIC numbers being used for illegal activities such as identity theft or fraud.” This same treatment applies to birth certificate numbers, foreign identification numbers and work permit numbers. As for passport numbers, even though they are periodically changed, organisations should avoid collecting the full numbers unless justified, it said. The updated guidelines do not apply to a public agency or an organisation acting on its behalf though. A Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that the Government, as the issuing authority for the NRIC, “rightfully uses the NRIC to discharge its functions and services with citizens in a secure manner”. It will review its processes to ensure public agencies limit the use of NRIC numbers, and the retention of physical NRICs, to transactions where such use is required by law or is necessary to accurately establish people’s identities, the spokesperson said. “As we improve the use of data to serve citizens and businesses, the Government will ensure that our data protection measures continue to be on par, if not better, than best practices in the private sector,” added the spokesperson. MAKING THE CHANGE To help ease the transition for organisations here, especially for smaller businesses, PDPC said it will work with the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) to do the following: As alternatives to NRIC numbers organisations could allow users to create their own user ID, email addresses or tracking numbers in verifying their identities, PDPC said. Other examples could be the use of mobile phone numbers or the use of parts of the NRIC, like the last three digits and the last letter. There are 22 pre-approved technology solutions identified for organisations to turn to as they embark on the necessary changes. For companies worried about the financial outlay of adopting these solutions, IMDA said they can apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant to help defray the costs. And there are business benefits to be reaped for companies who view this requirement as a competitive advantage, rather than a compliance cost. Mr Yeong Zee Kin, deputy commissioner at PDPC, said: \"If there's no need to hang on to NRIC data, then keeping it actually introduces additional risk” as he warned that the data could potentially be hacked and the organisations liable for any leaked information. The directive for organisations to dispose of NRIC numbers they have collected \"is actually the trickiest directive to implement\", said Mr Adrian Tan, head of Intellectual Property and Technology, Media and Telecom at TSMP Law Corporation. \"The whole point of data collection is that data, once collected, lives forever, somewhere, somehow,\" Mr Tan explained.  \"Data is stored and backed up off-site. So, while there is a lot of technology to protect and store data, there is a lot less technology to ensure that data has been completely and thoroughly scrubbed away from the cloud and from everywhere else.\"   Beyond the updated guidelines, PDPC said a mindset change is needed to better safeguard personal data. \"Old practices introduced back in the pen-and-paper days needs to be revised ... to be more sophisticated and digitally secure,” Mr Yeong explained. He also said it’s not just organisations that need to change, but consumers too. Responding to an example brought up by Channel NewsAsia about contests found on AXS machines requiring people to sign up using their NRIC numbers to stand a chance to win a car, Mr Yeong said: “Consumers also need to ask if they want to give such data for a chance to win a car.” “All parties need to play a part,” he added. TSMP's Tan agreed, saying that as the Government rolls out the next-generation digital identity system, NRIC will have far more information on it.  \"We cannot carry on with old practices and need to start treating our ICs with more respect\".", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/organisations-collecting-nric-details-from-september-2019-10670148"}, {"datetime": "31 Aug 2018 07:09AM", "tags": ["Team Singapore", "Asian Games", "table tennis"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: Singapore paddlers through to last 16", "content": " JAKARTA: Singapore table tennis players Feng Tianwei, Yu Mengyu and Gao Ning have qualified on Thursday (Aug 30) for the last 16 in the singles event at the 2018 Asian Games.  The trio won their respective matches easily and now stand a chance to win Singapore's first table tennis medal at this edition of the Games.  Gao, 35, defeated 19-year-old Qatar national Mohammed Abdulhussein 4-0.

The sculptors are hand-picked by local sand artist JOOheng Tan, who is lead sand sculptor for the Marvel edition of Sentosa Sandsation.  For instance, American sand sculptor Kirk Rademaker was one of the two artists chosen to build Asgard, because of his background in construction and his interest in architecture and modern buildings, Tan told Channel NewsAsia.  At about 5.5 metres, Asgard is the tallest sculpture at the sand festival. Working alongside Mexican sand sculptor Calixto Molina, the California-based Rademaker quipped that they had a running joke between them. \"We're building a wall,\" he said laughing. All the other sculptures are at least three metres tall – and meticulous planning goes into creating them from scratch.  Sand is compacted by machines into massive wooden sand boxes, and hosed down with water to pack the sand down even further. This makes the sand compact and ready for sculpting, Tan told Channel NewsAsia. Sea water is used because it is readily available at Sentosa, he added.  Sculptors have to begin from the very top of the structure, and the wooden boards are removed layer by layer as they progress.  About 2,000 tonnes of sand is used – all of it taken from a sand bank on Sentosa. Compared to the other beaches in Singapore, the sand in Sentosa is the most appropriate for sculpting because of its finer grain, Tan said. Tan explained that coarser sand is less appropriate for sculpting as it cannot withstand sticking together for an extended period of time compared to finer sand.  \"Generally, the finer the sand, the more suitable it is for sand sculpting,\" Tan said. \"That said, it really is not about the type of sand, but more of how the sand sculptor understands the temperament of the sand and what makes it work for them.\" For Italy's Michela Ciappini, who is in Singapore for the first time, the challenge lay more in fighting the humidity.  \"It gets really hot in Italy during summer and the temperatures can go up to 40 degrees but I can withstand it – just not the humidity,\" she said.  Ciappini added that the sand was not as strong as she had hoped. \"When I arrived, I realised that the sand wasn't the best. But the show must go on and you have to find a way,\" she stated. Tan said that Singapore's weather causes the sand sculptures to dry faster, so they have to be sprayed with a water-soluble mixture from time to time to create a protective layer over them. Tan reckoned that the New York City skyline was the most complicated design to create, because of the sheer amount of detail involved. \"Every 10cm or so, some form of carving is involved,\" he said.  Sentosa Sandsation: MARVEL Edition runs from Sep 1 to 16 at Siloso Beach.

Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon announced on Thursday (Aug 30) that law graduates will have to complete a year of practice training with a firm, double the current six months, after passing the Singapore Bar examinations from 2023. Another significant change will be the raising of the standard of Part B of the exams. Part B is taken by graduates from local and overseas universities, while Part A is a requirement only for overseas graduates. These changes are the first significant ones to the professional training regime for lawyers since 2010, when the Practical Law Course was revamped into Part B of the exams, according to the Ministry of Law. Some have welcomed the recommendations. Professor Simon Chesterman, dean of the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Law, said that the more stringent requirements should ensure that the students who wish to enter practice are prepared for the challenges and opportunities that await them. \"At the same time, law firms should use the longer training period to offer a solid grounding for the next generation of lawyers, with diverse experiences and supportive mentorship,\" he said. Mr Shashi Nathan, the regional head of dispute resolution and partner at law firm Withers KhattarWong, said that the changes are \"very welcome\" for both law firms and young lawyers. \"It helps law firms because we now know that with the enhanced exams and the one-year training, you're going to get higher-quality young lawyers come into practice,\" said the 51-year-old, who has been practising law for 25 years. \"Now, we find that young lawyers, after six months, they are still finding their feet. But a year of training, exposure and mentoring certainly give you the equipment and the arms to go to war.\" As for the more difficult exams, Mr Nathan said he did not think there was anything wrong to expect the highest quality for lawyers in Singapore, as practice itself \"is becoming more difficult\". He said he felt there still is a glut of lawyers, and \"I think part of the recommendations may have come from (that)\". ARE STRICTER EXAMS A WAY TO LIMIT NUMBER OF LAWYERS?  Law students that Channel NewsAsia spoke to referred to the 2014 glut of lawyers experienced in Singapore, and hinted that the new moves could be to avoid this. In response to media queries, the Ministry of Law said that the number of overseas law graduates returning to Singapore peaked in 2014, at about 350. \"The number has since fallen by about 25 per cent to about 260,\" said the ministry spokesman. \"About 690 law graduates, both overseas and local, enter the job market each year.\" Last year, more than 90 per cent secured training contracts, which is currently required for them to be called to the Bar. When asked if the new changes are in response to the 2014 oversupply of lawyers, the Committee that recommended the changes told Channel NewsAsia: \"The Committee was established to undertake a holistic review of the professional training regime for trainee lawyers in Singapore. The central theme of the Committee's recommendations is training to ensure that the needs of the public are well served and lawyers are equipped to face future challenges, regardless of economic conditions.\" Whether or not the moves are calculated to limit the number of practising lawyers, some law students feel they may deter some from becoming lawyers. The changes will not affect Mr Daryl Yang, 25, a current Yale-NUS student who will likely be called to the bar in 2020, but he said the longer training period may deter those who \"are not entirely sure that they want to practise law from trying in the first place\". He added that one year might be too long, saying that trainees are paid significantly less than associates. While Mr Yang found it encouraging that the legal fraternity was \"recognising the diversity of the role of legally trained people beyond practising lawyers\", he said: \"I'm not sure if the standard of the Part B examinations directly translates into the abilities of a practising lawyer, so I'm not sure if it necessarily raises the standard.\" HOW POPULAR ARE ALTERNATIVE LAW CAREERS? In response to queries from the media, the Ministry of Law said that one in five law graduates who were called to the Bar in 2017 did not go on to practise law. Professor Chesterman said that \"the reality is that not every law student wants to practise\". \"The new regime will enable such students to complete their legal training, get called to the Bar, and then choose the path that suits them. They can then use their legal training in other sectors of the economy,\" he said. Lawyer hopeful Jason Hong, 25, who graduated last year from Durham University, said that among his friends, those who do not want to become practising lawyers are a minority. Mr Hong, who failed his Part A exam recently and hopes to pass it later this year, welcomed the extended practice training. As an overseas law graduate, he had to undergo relevant legal training, which is similar to practice training. He found this useful, as he \"learnt a lot more than I would in law school because so many things are different in practice\". \"I think the extra time, while it may be daunting to some, is a really good learning experience,\" he said. Asked about the more stringent Part B exams, Mr Hong laughed and said: \"For me, it's already very hard to pass Part A.\" However, he added: \"You have to give and take when it comes to things like this ... they are literally raising the bar. So they want to get the best.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/they-are-literally-raising-the-bar-changes-to-singapore-bar-10668692"}, {"datetime": "31 Aug 2018 06:31AM", "tags": ["SMRT", "CEO", "work life", "leadership", "management"], "author": "Lawrence Loh", "title": "Commentary: Replacing the CEO isn’t enough to reboot corporate culture", "content": " SINGAPORE: Stories of corporate culture gone off the rails have become a regular feature in the headlines. From rampant sexism and bullying, falsifying of critical safety records, to underhand tactics against competitors and outright fraud, breakdowns in standards of governance inevitably lead to demands for strong action to be taken.  But while companies, governments and regulators may feel tempted to take decisive action to appease public anger, what are the most effective ways to bring corporate culture back on track? Here are three insights to consider: 1. A NEW BROOM IS NOT ALWAYS THE ANSWER When the rot sets in, it is tempting to demand change at the top.  In Singapore last year, a series of incidents at metro rail operator SMRT led to growing criticism in the press, an outpouring of anger on social media and hearings in the national parliament. Responding to the criticism, SMRT’s then CEO said the firm was “awash in collective shame” as calls mounted for senior heads to roll. Yet in many instances, a witch hunt may actually prove counterproductive - a symbolic sacrifice rather than a substantive step to address the critical problems that the company faces. Put another way - is it wise to eject the pilot when we need to fix a plane in mid-flight? Instead of demanding a “fall guy” to take the blame, it may be wiser for the leader to “fall in” - after all, they know best how the company works and how to address its challenges.  Of course in some cases change at the top is the only option.  Last year the CEO and founder of Uber, Travis Kalanick, was forced to stand down after a series of scandals hit the company. His replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, has vowed to reboot the firm by introducing a new set of cultural values to the global ride-sharing firm. Writing in a blog post on LinkedIn he said that “the culture and approach that got Uber where it is today is not what will get us to the next level\". Yet Uber is likely an exception. Rocked by a series of scandals, the firm had reached a tipping point. A closer look at recent corporate history – companies such as Apple, HP, Yahoo and Starbucks - reveals many incidences where a new CEO does not automatically sweep the company clean. In some cases – Apple, for example - the original CEO had to be called back to tackle problems the successor could not fix.  2. BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE PROBLEM After major corporate calamities, it is often the demonstration of commitment that matters more than what the company does with the CEO. Focusing on transparency will be the real determinant of success. The German multinational company Siemens has seen a series of corruption cases dating back more than a century. In 1914, for example, it was involved in a spectacular case of bribery in a deal with the Imperial Japanese Navy.  More recently, in 2005, Siemens officials were exposed surreptitiously paying off Greek government officials during the 2004 Summer Olympics.  The final straw came in 2008 when investigations by the German and US governments, among others, led to fines totalling some 2.5 billion euros (US$2.9 billion). Jolted into action, Siemens culture recovery was impressive. Strict anti-corruption rules and processes were rapidly rolled out and the number of compliance staff was ramped up from just 86 to 500.  In addition, Siemens took on a former Interpol official to head its investigation unit and a co-founder of watchdog Transparency International to serve as an advisor. Contrast that with the response of German car giant Volkswagen in the diesel emission scandal of 2015. When it was first revealed that emission tests might have been tampered with, Volkswagen first went into denial, insisting discrepancies were mere technical glitches.  It was only in the face of indisputable data that executives acknowledged there had been deliberate deception. In the following months, more revelations surfaced, panic recalls were instituted worldwide and the company’s value and reputation plunged. Volkswagen did not try to arrest the problem by being more candid in its disclosures. The common thing that happened at Siemens and Volkswagen was a CEO change after the debacles. But the results were vastly different. It probably goes beyond just the CEO factor but points more to the systemic adoption of transparency across all levels and functions of the organisation. 3. STAY FOCUSED ON GOOD GOVERNANCE The bottom line in any effort to change corporate culture after a crisis is to be resolute in implementing solid governance practices.  Japanese optics and instrument manufacturer Olympus became the poster boy of bad governance in 2011 when a US$1.7 billion fraud was discovered by its newly appointed CEO, Michael Woodford.  The revelations took Olympus to the brink of collapse, wiping 82 per cent off its share value within a month and leading some observers to dub the firm “the Enron of Japan”. Yet Olympus managed a miraculous turnaround, implementing strong governance measures that reshaped a highly conservative Japanese corporate culture. These include having outside members who form the majority of the board as well as genuinely independent external auditors. As a result Olympus today is thriving once again. Olympus’ business strategy had been totally overwhelmed by its bad culture. As management guru Peter Drucker famously quipped: “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”  Good governance however can often come to the rescue and put a derailed organisation back on track. If anything, I should add:  Governance eats culture for lunch.

The two initiatives were part of a string of measures announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at his National Day Rally recently. In a studio interview with Mediacorp’s News 5 programme, Mr Heng was asked whether the new schemes announced by Mr Lee would mean there would be a further increase in the Goods and Services Tax.  Mr Heng had said in his Budget 2018 speech in February that GST would be raised to 9 per cent between 2021 and 2025. In response, Mr Heng said that while new schemes like Home Improvement Programme II and the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme will have \"very significant\" fiscal implications, these have been a part of the Government’s long-term planning. “I think we are very unusual in planning multi-years’ projects way ahead. And that’s how we have been able to do our CHAS as well as the Pioneer Generation Package and the Merdeka package now,” he said. “So the package that has been announced by PM, the extension of CHAS and the Merdeka package, we have sufficient resources in the coming years to do that. “I announced earlier the 2 percentage point increase in the GST rate. This is to fund our expenditure which is going to go higher and is going to recur year after year. And we’re making early preparations for that so that we can take better care for Singaporeans.” The Merdeka Generation Package will help Singaporeans born in the 1950s with healthcare costs, PM Lee had said at the National Day Rally. The package will cover outpatient subsidies, Medisave top-ups, MediShield Life premium subsidies and payouts for long-term care for about 500,000 Singaporeans. The package will not be as big as the S$8 billion Pioneer Generation Package, Mr Heng said. “How big a package that will be: We have some ballpark figures but I would like to scrub the number a lot more carefully and I will announce details of this at next year’s Budget,” Mr Heng said. On whether the GST increase is projected to happen sooner or later, the finance minister said much depends on how the economy is doing. “We are seeing very significant structural changes in the global economy. We’re seeing significant changes in technology and technological advances will happen faster than we expect,” he said. “Therefore we've got to make early preparations for this. If our economy continues to grow and be vibrant, we will, not just the Government, but our people will continue to have enough resources to manage these changes that are coming.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/heng-swee-keat-government-has-sufficient-resources-new-schemes-10668786"}, {"datetime": "30 Aug 2018 10:29PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Mahathir Mohamad", "Thum Ping Tjin", "Tan Wah Piow"], "author": "Sumisha Naidu", "title": "Malaysia PM Mahathir invited to speak at democracy conference by political activists", "content": " PUTRAJAYA: Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has accepted an invitation “in principle” to speak at a conference on building democracy in Southeast Asia next year, organised by a former Singaporean citizen - activist Tan Wah Piow. A representative from Malaysia’s Prime Minister’s Office confirmed this after a meeting on Thursday (Aug 30) between Dr Mahathir, Tan and four Singaporean “non-governmental individuals”, including historian Thum Ping Tjin. The other individuals did not wish to be named. Separately, activists Jolovan Wham and Kirsten Han posted on their Facebook pages that they had attended the meeting with Dr Mahathir. Author Sonny Liew posted comments about the meeting on his page. The meeting was organised with the help of Malaysian political activist, Hishammuddin Rais, who was present and is also part of Tan’s organisation - Forces for the Renewal of Southeast Asia. Dr Mahathir led the Pakatan Harapan coalition to victory for the first time in Malaysia’s history in May, defeating his former alliance, Barisan Nasional. He was asked to give the keynote address at the yet-to-be-named conference but the 93-year-old returning PM’s attendance depends on his availability, his office said. “As far as I’m concerned, the most important things that Tun Mahathir brought about through his victory is this positiveness and aspiration for a freer society,” Tan told media outside Dr Mahathir’s office at the Perdana Leadership Foundation in Putrajaya. “Personally, I am very grateful for this open, democratic space that Tun Mahathir’s government has opened and it’s a beacon for many who are struggling for democracy. Not just in Singapore but in other parts of Southeast Asia.” Thum added that he had “urged (Dr Mahathir) to take the lead in lobbying for the promotion of democracy and freedom of expression and inquiry in Southeast Asia” during the meeting.  “I felt Malaysia is in a unique opportunity to really be a beacon of democracy in the region,” he said.  When asked what he thought the Singapore government’s reaction to the meeting would be, Tan replied: “I think they will be very concerned, not because I met with Dr Mahathir, but the fact that the prime minister is prepared to share his views about democracy and to enhance the development of democracy in the region. “And that Malaysia is now shining this beacon which is probably stealing the limelight from Singapore. I think that’s what worries them. Singapore is becoming (an) outdated, archaic society with its dominant party controls.” Tan, a former student union leader, fled Singapore in 1976 after being convicted in a rioting case.  The Singapore Government named Tan as the mastermind of the 1987 Marxist Conspiracy, which led to 22 people being detained for allegedly being part of a plot to overthrow the Government, in a crackdown known as Operation Spectrum. Tan’s Singapore citizenship was revoked that same year.

Singapore - the ASEAN chair for 2018 - has said it hopes to conclude negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) by the end of the year, as talks got underway on Thursday (Aug 30), day two of the 50th ASEAN Economic Ministers’ Meeting (AEM). \"I'm aware that we're scheduled to discuss the RCEP until late tonight, and if we can't agree, we will lock the room and throw out the key,\" jested Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, who is the AEM chairman. Speaking to media on the sidelines of the AEM, Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said issues to be ironed out include \"trade in goods, market access, and services\". When concluded, RCEP would be the world's largest trading bloc, accounting for a third of global GDP. Prior to the current talks, RCEP has gone through 23 rounds of negotiations. \"I could sense the determination of everyone around the table that this is an opportunity that we need to seize, because of the current challenges we are facing in the global economy and the global trading environment,\" said Mr Chan. \"We are all very realistic that next year, various countries will have various domestic preoccupations and we really need to build on the momentum and try to get the task substantially done by the end of this year.\" Thailand takes over from Singapore as ASEAN chair next year, and is aiming to deliver on the initial draft wording then. “We all need to put all the important issues and core issues in the package and come to an agreement on those issues. If that approach is successful at this meeting, that means that next year when Thailand take the chairmanship, it will be the year that we put everything in language,\" said Thai Deputy Commerce Minister Chutima Bunyapraphasara.   Besides the 10 member states of ASEAN, RCEP includes economic heavyweights like China, Japan, and Korea. It is tipped to be key, at a time when trade conflicts appear to be gathering pace. \"RCEP will promote the establishment of a regional value chain and lay the groundwork for ASEAN Plus Three to develop into a substantial economic community, as it encompasses both Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia,\" said South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Hyung-Chong. \"It'll also prevent the currently escalating trade war from spreading further and contribute to the promotion of free and open trade.\" Mr Chan also noted that the substantial conclusion of RCEP by end-2018 will reaffirm the region's continued support for free trade against the backdrop of rising protectionist sentiments.  \"This will also send a positive signal to our business stakeholders, and reassure them that the RCEP region remains committed to putting in place a business-friendly regional environment,\" he said. Besides RCEP, economic ministers have also been discussing other areas of concern, such as on lowering trade barriers and promoting regional connectivity. A key topic is harmonising trade and customs procedures across ASEAN countries, as each of the 10 countries have different regulatory systems and are at different levels of development.

The five IAP recommendations were offered after the panel went through a draft of the WSH2028 plan during a three-day meeting at the WSH Conference. The panel said that it supported the proposed plan to review and expand the existing list of 40 occupational diseases to include those that can cause occupational cancers, which could help more affected workers receive appropriate compensation. It also recommended including and addressing work-related psychosocial stress and issues in the final roadmap. The panel also supported the WSH Tripartite Strategy Committee's proposed plan to create a code of practice outlining a company's board of directors' WSH duties to ensure greater accountability. It added that this code can be developed in partnership with the business community to inculcate stewardship of WSH. The IAP also recommended that companies inculcate a culture of prevention, trust and care. This can be done by having companies conduct their own investigations of near-misses as it will allow them to identify gaps in their processes and procedures. The last recommendation is to clarify WSH responsibilities to self-employed persons. The panel said that the final roadmap should consider the potential growth of self-employed persons in Singapore over the next decade. “Singapore has made significant progress in her WSH outcomes over the past decade. The WSH2028 strategy builds upon this success and sets out an approach to guide it through the next 10 years - to both address current challenges, seek to anticipate future ones, and meet its aspirations to be one of the world leaders in terms of WSH performance and outcomes,\" IAP member Kevin Myers said. Mr Myers, who is the president of the International Association of Labour Inspection, was part of the six-member panel with WSH experts from Australia, Canada, Germany, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States. WSH2028 TO ALSO FOCUS ON WSH AT PROCUREMENT The draft, drawn up by the WSH2028 Tripartite Safety Committee, bears the vision of having a healthy workforce and safe workplaces. It aims to make zero injuries and ill-health at workplaces a norm, and has set the goal of reducing the fatality rate to less than one per 100,000 workers. To that end, it outlined three strategies: To deepen WSH ownership, renew focus on workplace health and promote technology adoption of WSH technology. To deepen WSH ownership, the committee has suggested that MOM should make WSH performance of companies more transparent, to help businesses be more discerning when they procure good and services. \"In Singapore, we cannot continue to award tenders based solely on the lowest quote. Evaluation of contracts must take into consideration safety performance of the contractors, and this is important. I'm quite confident that companies will buy into this over time.\" said Mr John Ng, chairman of the WSH Council. The committee added that the Government can harmonise its procurement criteria across agencies and disqualify contractors with poor safety records. It has also suggested that employers can facilitate health promotion at the workplace, especially with a rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as stroke and heart attack.  There were about 60 deaths a year on average in the past few years as a result of heart attacks or strokes, possibly contributed to by strenuous activity at work, according to an MOM spokesperson. To promote technology adoption to advance WSH outcomes, the committee suggested setting up a Centre of Innovation and Technology to help promote technology-based solutions for WSH. “To get more companies committed to WSH, we need to link WSH outcomes (more closely) with their business performance, and with how MOM balances regulations,” said Mr Zaqy. “Rather than seeing WSH as a cost, companies should view it as a worthwhile investment. Good safety practices also mean effective and efficient business processes, translating to good business performance,” he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government-accepts-proposals-to-strengthen-next-workplace-safety-10667652"}, {"datetime": "30 Aug 2018 05:42PM", "tags": ["crime", "police", "vice"], "author": "", "title": "17 women arrested in vice raids at multiple hotels", "content": " SINGAPORE: Seventeen women were arrested on Thursday (Aug 30) for their suspected involvement in vice-related activities after the police raided several hotels.

Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat used this analogy to illustrate how countries can benefit from economic integration and multilateral trade, at a time when countries are resorting to protectionist measures as a result of trade disagreements. Speaking at the ASEAN and Asia Forum organised by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) on Thursday (Aug 30), he said regional countries must work together to find their own competitive advantages.  \"Those of us who go to a hawker centre know that we don't go to a hawker centre to eat the same food every day,\" Mr Heng said to an audience of around 200 corporate leaders and policymakers. \"But the great thing about many of our good hawker centres is it has such a good variety.  \"I hope the ASEAN and Asian region will be that way too - that each of us is specialising in different areas and the grouping as a whole becomes attractive.\" He added that the region should welcome investments from all over the world, including traditional sources such as the US, Europe and Japan, emerging economies like China and India, as well as cross-border investments within ASEAN. \"That's how Singapore has grown in the last 53 years,\" said Mr Heng. \"That's why I feel very strongly that globalisation will need to be defended and supported.\" Mr Heng said countries should make use of multilateral platforms such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to settle any disputes or disagreements, when asked for his thoughts on United States-China trade tensions. If the friction boils over into a global trade war, Mr Heng warned that the outcome will be \"negative for everyone\" - including the countries that start them.  \"Many economists who have studied this deeply have all advocated that tariff measures and retaliatory measures are not the right solution, even if you're unhappy about certain areas,\" said Mr Heng.  \"For many small countries around the world, the rule-based multilateral system is our best bet, and we need to uphold and defend this multilateral system.\" STRONG SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Mr Heng said he was heartened by the strong support for regional economic integration. He stressed that countries should continue to advance and expand the ASEAN Economic Community, which envisions the regional bloc as a single market integrated in the global economy. The next step is to bring together agreements made between ASEAN and countries such as India, Japan and China into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.  \"That will be a very major grouping, with half of the world's population and 30 per cent of the world's gross domestic product,\" said Mr Heng. \"I hope it does not lead to the fragmentation of the world into major trading blocs. But based on our own experience with free trade agreements, regional and bilateral agreements are important building blocks for a broader international agreement.\" \"Our hope must continue to be on the WTO Doha Round, to try to conclude it and see how we can do it,\" Mr Heng said, referring to the latest round of WTO negotiations launched in 2001, which aims to lower barriers and revise trade rules. In the process of coming to bilateral and regional agreements, countries learn how to make structural changes in their economies and learn how to cooperate and settle disputes better, Mr Heng added. When asked by dialogue moderator and SIIA chairman Simon Tay how Singapore sees Chinese-led infrastructure projects, Mr Heng said that China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a \"good project and good set of ideas\".  But he pointed out the importance of its execution, \"lest unrelated projects be billed as part of the BRI\".", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/heng-swee-keat-us-china-trade-war-asean-forum-10667228"}, {"datetime": "30 Aug 2018 05:03PM", "tags": ["business", "Michael Bloomberg", "China", "United States", "trade", "trade war"], "author": "", "title": "China business forum shifts launch to Singapore amid US trade row", "content": " SHANGHAI: Organisers of a new business leaders' forum spearheaded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have been forced to move the event from Beijing to Singapore, amid growing China-US trade friction and scheduling conflicts with another forum. The New Economy Forum, planned for Nov 6 to 8, coincides with a massive new import fair in Shanghai that has been endorsed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and aims to demonstrate China's value as a powerful consumer of foreign goods and services. With no end in sight to the escalating China-US trade war, the Shanghai import fair has taken on heightened symbolic significance, with officials pulling out all the stops to ensure it is a success. According to forum's website, the event's partner in China, the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, asked that the New Economy Forum in Beijing be rescheduled to the fall of 2019 because of a \"growing number of scheduling conflicts in China this year\". A source familiar with the matter said forum organisers had argued - ultimately unsuccessfully - that their event would complement the Shanghai import fair by bringing hundreds of top global business leaders to China at the same time. However, rather than postpone the event, the venue for the inaugural forum was shifted to Singapore \"because of its position as one of the world's leading international and business hubs\", the statement said. The second meeting of the forum would be held in Beijing next year, it said. The China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing-based research institute headed by former vice premier Zeng Peiyan, did not reply immediately to an emailed request for a comment. On launching the New Economy Forum in May, Bloomberg told the Financial Times that its focus was on how the world and China could work together. The inaugural forum in Singapore will cover topics including global economic management, trade and investment, technology, urbanisation, capital markets, climate change and inclusion, according to the forum's website. The forum lists former US Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger as an honorary advisory board chair, and former US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former Vice Premier of China's State Council Zeng Peiyan as co-chairs. Its advisory board includes Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, former US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, Alibaba Group executive chairman Jack Ma and former chair of the US Federal Reserve Board of Governors Janet Yellen.

During this time, he set up a company to invest in shares and foreign exchange on behalf of other investors, without holding a Capital Markets Services licence, said MAS in a press release on Thursday (Aug 30).  He then left UOB to manage his own fund management business.

In addition, Part B of the exam will be more stringent, announced Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in a speech on Thursday (Aug 30). Part B is taken by graduates from both local and overseas universities, while Part A is a requirement only for those from overseas universities. For law graduates who decide not to become practising lawyers, they can still be called to the Bar after passing the exams – without having to complete the practice training period. This means a practice training contract will no longer be a pre-condition for admission to the Bar. For these students, they can pursue alternative careers such as becoming an in-house counsel, practice support lawyers, law academics and legal technologists. “The completion of a practice training contract will only be a pre-requisite for those who intend to practice law,” said Chief Justice Menon. “This proposal recognises that a person who has studied law can contribute to society without becoming a practising lawyer, and that it is not necessary for those who choose to pursue different pathways to first complete a period of practical training before starting work.” The changes, which the Chief Justice described as a “significant restructuring” of the professional training regime, were among the recommendations made by the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers. Formed in August 2016, the committee chaired by Justice Quentin Loh included judges and law practitioners. The committee's report, which was published on the Supreme Court's website on Thursday afternoon, detailed challenges to the existing training regime of lawyers in Singapore. Among the findings were: A lack of training information, intense competition for practice training contracts and a lack of consistency in training standards across firms. Additionally, even after law graduates completed their practice training, there was a perceived \"lack of transparency in the decision-making process\" on whether or not they were retained in the law firms. Justice Loh said the committee believes that its recommendations \"will raise the quality and consistency of training standards across law firms and provide different pathways and opportunities for the legal profession\". CHANGES WILL GIVE LAW GRADS 'GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND CHOICE' The Ministry of Law said in a statement that it has accepted in principle the proposals, along with 17 other recommendations on the training of lawyers. \"The proposed change recognises that a legal education can lead to different career pathways, and allows law graduates greater flexibility and choice,\" said the ministry. It also pointed out that the practice training period for solicitors in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Hong Kong is two years. Implementing the recommendations in 2023 will give the industry \"time to adjust\", the ministry added, and the majority of students who are currently in law school will not be affected. Speaking at the first session of this year's mass call, where more than 450 newly appointed law advocates and solicitors will be called to the Bar, Chief Justice Menon touched on the qualities that a lawyer should have, including passionate curiosity and finding solutions with technology.

In response to media queries, a spokesperson from Singapore's Ministry of Transport said: \"We have not received any official proposal or communications from Malaysia regarding a third link between Singapore and Malaysia.\" Earlier, Malaysian state media reported that the Johor government was researching the possibility of building a bridge from Pengerang near Kota Tinggi to the Pulau Ubin island in Singapore.  The proposed bridge could help ease traffic congestion on the two existing bridges which link the two countries, said Johor's Chief Minister Osman Sapian as cited by Bernama.   \"Yesterday, I had a discussion with interested parties about the possibility of a third link from east Johor. We observed that the area was close to Pulau Ubin - they were only about 3km apart,\" Mr Osman said. Mr Osman said it was likely that the link would have a different customs and immigration system from the one used at the Causeway and Second Link.  \"We may use a new system. It could be that Singapore and Malaysia's immigration checks will be conducted just once either in Pengerang or in Pulau Ubin,\" said the minister.  The project was still at the research stage, he added, and findings would be presented to the federal government to be studied.  Mr Osman also commented on the RTS link, saying that the project would likely begin in the third quarter of 2019.  \"The design of the RTS will remain as it was decided before. It's just that presently, there is an overlap of companies,\" he said. The RTS, which is supposed to operate from Bukit Chagar to the Woodlands North station in Singapore, is expected to be able to carry up to 10,000 passengers per hour when it is ready in 2024.  Mahathir's comment comes after he reviewed a series of infrastructure projects with China and with Singapore that had been pushed by his predecessor Najib Razak, whose coalition suffered a surprise defeat in the May election.

But reduction of the price is very difficult as far as we can make out. So it has to be deferred,\" he said.  Mr Azmin had said then that he planned to visit Singapore in the near future to discuss the status of the HSR agreement.

The report, which includes a survey of more than 1,000 people in Singapore on their plastic usage habits and attitudes towards recycling, is the culmination of an eight-month study, SEC said in a media release.  It was commissioned jointly by Deloitte & Touche Enterprise Risk Services. Explaining the findings, SEC chairman Isabella Loh pointed out that some consumers are under the impression that some single-use plastics cannot be recycled. “Take the single-use plastics at the hawker centres ... When people buy takeaway food to eat at home, and they throw the container down the rubbish chute because it is contaminated. But some of these single-use plastics can actually be recycled,” she said, citing the poor markings on recyclables as a possible reason for the mistaken belief. “This is something we have to look at in terms of standardising markings,” she added. According to the report, 45 per cent of respondents said they needed more information on the different types of plastics, and what can and cannot be recycled.  As for why they do not recycle, 42 per cent of respondents cited inconvenience as a reason. SEC executive director Jen Teo noted that one way to help people improve their recycling habits is to have companies print recyclability information on their packaging products.  This, she said, will “facilitate upstream sorting and recycling”, making the collection of recyclable plastic items more efficient. “This initiative would go together with a new education campaign to teach the public what and how to recycle their plastic waste,” she said. Pointing out that Singapore’s plastics recycling rate stood at just 6 per cent last year, SEC’s Ms Loh added that the findings were not surprising. “This was a call for action ... Are we throwing away the future of Singapore, and are we throwing away valuable fuel that could be diverted for another industry? That’s basically the question we are asking,” she said. \"NEW CIRCULAR ECONOMY\" FOR PLASTICS NEEDED: SEC  The report also suggests that the creation of a “new circular economy” for plastics couldimprove Singapore’s plastic recycling rates, said SEC. Ms Loh explained that currently, Singapore’s plastic ecosystem is “mostly linear”. This means that plastic goes from producers to consumers and then to the waste bin. “We need to connect producers, consumers and downstream users to form a circular economy for plastics so they are collected, recycled and reused to generate other products,” she said. “This will reduce the pressure on Singapore’s waste stream as well as conserve natural resources. “Singapore has the knowledge and the talent to develop innovative methods to reintroduce recycled plastic into the economy to aid growth and build a circular plastics economy,” she added. Several recommendations to help improve Singapore’s plastics ecosystem were made in the report. One of them is to build a market for recycled plastic through innovation. SEC suggested that governments and public sector organisations could step in to support existing markets in Singapore that are using specific types of plastics for manufacturing recycled plastic pellets. It explained that recycled plastic can be used to support major manufacturing segments in Singapore, particularly biomedical manufacturing, electronics and general manufacturing industries. “For example, several start-up companies around the world are devising machines to produce plastic filaments to be used for 3D printing machines,” said SEC. “Singapore’s plastic waste stream could be directed towards recycling for biomedicine companies for 3D printing. “Similarly, recycled plastics can be used for flat-panel displays and ink and toner cartridges for the electronics manufacturing sector, as well as the use of artificial intelligence for waste management.” The report was launched at SEC’s conference on Thursday, which was also held in conjunction with the annual Singapore Environmental Achievement Awards.  A total of 14 companies and organisations were honoured at the ceremony for their sustainable business practices. NEED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO DO THEIR PART, MORE PUBLIC EDUCATION Speaking at the conference, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli stressed the importance of raising awareness among the public and encouraging people to love and take care of the environment. “Government and businesses can only do so much,” he said. “We cannot legislate desirable behaviour – we need to change societal norms and people’s mindsets, so that individuals are personally committed to living a “zero waste 3R lifestyle.” The minister added that civil society plays a critical role in this area. “SEC’s effort to fight plastic waste, and its call for individuals to use one less plastic item a day, is commendable,” he said. “I hope the public will rise to the challenge.” “Collectively, we can make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic waste we generate every month.” Building a mindset of shared responsibility was also a topic highlighted during a panel discussion at the conference. Manufacturers, said one panellist, are but one part of the value chain, and cannot force members of the public to return items to them. The panellists and audience members also agreed on the need for educating consumers in this area, with a straw poll indicating that most believed public education and running campaigns would help increase the recycling rate in Singapore.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/plastics-recycle-waste-singapore-environment-council-10666450"}, {"datetime": "30 Aug 2018 11:14AM", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "10,000 in Singapore to be taught AI basics for free", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singaporeans ranging from secondary students to working adults will get to pick up artificial intelligence (AI) basics for free as part of a programme called AI for Everyone (AI4E) unveiled on Thursday (Aug 30). The programme, which targets 10,000 participants, aims to familiarise them with AI and help them understand how it can be used in their daily lives, said Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran at an event to commemorate the first-year milestone for AI Singapore (AISG). It will also help dispel fears that AI will replace jobs, according to a separate joint fact sheet by AISG, Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). Materials for the three-hour workshop will be provided by tech giants Intel and Microsoft.  These free workshops will start from the end of this month and will run for three years.  AISG is a national programme set up to enhance Singapore’s AI capabilities and to power the country’s digital economy, its website said.

The Python programming language is one of the primary coding language for work in AI. On completing the Data Scientist in Python course comprising 20 modules that would take three months to complete, participants will receive a Foundations in AI certification. The course will cost S$500, but IMDA will provide financial support to those who qualify under the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme+ (CITREP+).  A full-time National Serviceman or student will receive up to 100 per cent fee support while trainees sponsored by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Singaporeans 40 and above will get up to 90 per cent of support.  Microsoft and Intel are also content partners for AI4I, and will be joined by DataCamp, on online data science learning platform.

The award recognises the recipients’ dedication to the holistic development of their students. The recipients were chosen from over 2,500 nominations by school leaders, teachers, former and current students, and parents. Seven other finalists were also recognised for their contributions. The finalists will receive their certifications at separate ceremonies. They will also receive a professional development grant to attend any overseas or local conferences. Since 2017, the award has been extended to include educators from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and polytechnics. This year, six finalists and recipients are educators from polytechnics and ITE, while nine teach in the primary school to junior college levels. GOING THE EXTRA MILE One of the finalists is Mr Khalid Kassim, who teaches Mechanical Engineering in ITE College East. To the veteran lecturer, building a student’s confidence takes more than just words of encouragement; it means showing his students how to apply their skills in real-life situations. Thus, he rallies his students to volunteer in a special Student Home Outreach programme. In this voluntary after-school activity, the students would help the family of a needy course-mate by fixing broken electrical appliances in their homes, helping with plumbing problems or even mending furniture – all these under Mr Khalid’s guidance. This has helped build his students' confidence, something that Mr Khalid has observed was lacking. “Most of my students didn’t do very well in school, and some have personal problems at home to deal with. So when they see that they can apply their skills outside the classroom, it builds their self-esteem,” he said. MAKING MUSIC INCLUSIVE For Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School music teacher Ng Sheh Feng - one of the recipients of the President's Award - she faced a conundrum when two visually-impaired students wanted to enrol in her music programme. The reason: No visually-impaired student had ever taken the O-Level music examination at that point in time. The examination authorities initially turned down their request as exam components included score-reading and notation writing. But Ms Ng persevered. She and her colleagues worked with the Education Ministry to experiment different ways of assessing the students. This included using music braille and dictation. After one-and-a-half years, the authorities approved the recommendations and allowed the students to take the exams. Ms Ng said she tries to make music inclusive to quash the perception that it is exclusive, to the extent that she even pushed for lunch time concerts and a music corner. “We set up a music corner and we put up some instruments just for the students to be able to jam and relax,” she said. Ms Ng said many of her students come from \"less resourced backgrounds\" and thus had less exposure to alternative pathways like music.  \"They would be thinking of careers in traditional professions like doctors or lawyers,\" she said. \"But we want to show them that there are alternative pathways in the arts too. Trying to change the mindset is slow, but it's happening.” While the award marks a milestone, Ms Ng says that in her 12 years as an educator, she has seen former students follow their aspirations to become composers, performers and music teachers. That, she said with a bright smile, is rewarding enough.

The AFAS was first signed in 1995.  Under the newly signed package, member states have increased the depth of their commitments and allowed market access into new services sectors, said Singapore’s Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing.  This means that ASEAN services providers will now enjoy a “legally-binding guarantee of the widest preferential services market access” into ASEAN markets in the region's history, while facing fewer discriminatory barriers, he added in his opening remarks for the signing ceremony. Services providers, including those based in Singapore, will also find it easier to participate in sectors that were previously closed in the region. These include logistics, air transport, maritime transport, computer, telecommunications, tourism, construction service sectors, and professional services. A protocol to amend the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) was also signed on Wednesday, paving the way for the implementation of the ASEAN-wide self-certification (AWSC) regime.  The new regime, first mooted by the grouping’s economic ministers in 2009, will allow certified exporters to self-certify the origin of their exports and enjoy preferential treatment, said Mr Chan.  This benefits both importers and exporters as it does away with the administrative hassle and additional costs to do with the application of a Certificate of Origin. It also helps improve efficiency for issuing authorities.  Singapore-based exporters, for instance, can potentially enjoy annual savings of about half a million dollars, the minister said.  With the two agreements being longstanding initiatives that have been much anticipated by the private sector, Mr Chan said they will contribute to a more open and facilitative business environment in ASEAN.  “Goods and services trade continue to be integral to our regional economic integration journey, and are the foundations of our regional trade architecture,\" he said. “They will help us to navigate the issues of today and the future, and continue to help us seize opportunities.\" Meanwhile, two agreements that would support regional e-commerce flows and power the digital economy were also endorsed. They are the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework - which will assist member states in improving the digital ecosystem and monitor progress in the region’s digital integration - and the ASEAN agreement on e-commerce.  The latter is the grouping’s first agreement in this area, and will be signed on the sidelines of the 17th ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Council Meeting in November.  Separately, a memorandum of understanding aimed at providing more support for start-ups and businesses in Japan and Singapore was signed by both countries on the sidelines of the annual meeting held at Shangri-La Hotel.

A recent study presented in June this year found that those with severe gum disease - where the tooth is in danger of falling out - were more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes. Among those studied, 8.6 per cent of severe gum disease patients were detected to have undiagnosed diabetes. In comparison, only 1.5 per cent of those with moderate gum disease were found to have undiagnosed diabetes. In all, 5.8 per cent of participants in the study - ranging from those with normal to severe gum disease - have undiagnosed diabetes. The study looked at 500 patients who were being treated or who were referred to the NDCS for possible gum disease. They declared that they did not have diabetes during their pre-medical screenings. Those with moderate and severe gum disease were also more likely to have pre-diabetes.  More than 30 per cent of the patients were detected to have pre-diabetes. Of these, 70 per cent had moderate to severe gum disease. DENTAL CLINICS WAY TO IMPROVE EARLY DETECTION OF DIABETES Diabetic patients are two to three times more at risk of getting gum infections, and diabetes will also worsen symptoms of gum disease.  At the same time, inflammation from gum disease will increase insulin resistance and worsen the diabetic condition. As such, the team suggested that apart from usual diabetes screenings, dental clinics may be a feasible setting to screen for diabetes as well. This may be a way to inprove early detection of diabetes in Singapore. NDCS's Dr Chee Hoe Kit, who is leading an extension of the study, advised diabetic patients to see a dentist at least once a year.  \"Ask for a detailed gum examination so that you will know the health of your gums and take measures to get any gum disease to be treated by your dentist,\" he said. \"If you’re not a diabetic patient ... and you have severe gum disease, then you may want to consider getting a blood test done in order to rule out that you may be having diabetes or even pre-diabetes.\" A patient with pre-diabetes may not necessarily develop diabetes later in life.

It focuses on two complementary research tracks - developing real-time monitoring systems and enhancing the reliability of existing rail assets. It pools together NTU researchers and SMRT staff.  Speaking at the launch, Mr Heng said: “This corporate laboratory aims to drive the effective translation of research into solutions that have direct relevance not just to SMRT, but to the global transport industry in anticipation of future needs.  \"It looks forward to technical issues that will affect transport systems of tomorrow, and directs the R&D today to develop solutions.”  One of the projects being tested on a train on the North-South and East-West Lines is the Advanced Train Door Sensor System.  When mounted onto train doors, the sensors record air pressure, movement speed and power systems. The sensors also come with algorithms that can predict imminent train door failures, and allow engineers to identify faults and reduce the time needed for troubleshooting.  More than half of all train delays are caused by door faults.  Another project is a cladding system that uses laser technology to repair defective rails along the tracks. The system can be mounted on wagon wheels to carry out rail steel repair works in a less labour-intensive manner. It also reduces the time taken to carry out the repairs to a single night compared to three nights currently. The system is expected to be deployed for trial in 2019.  Within the next two years, systems that can pick up defects on the power rail and running rails, as well as one that can inspect train axles, will be tested.  Mr Heng said the projects “will result in better management of train door faults, significant cuts in delays, faster and smarter track repairs, better-maintained trains and higher service levels”.  SMRT chief executive Neo Kian Hong said the company is working to improve rail reliability and sustain the progress made. “At the same time, we will tap top-notch engineering resources in Singapore to solve problems that affect our train services, such as train door, track or power supply issues,\" he added.  Said NTU president Professor Subra Suresh: \"Using latest sensor technology, radio frequency technology, 3D printing and many other tools, we have an opportunity to take cutting-edge research to solve immediate problems of interest to millions of commuters in Singapore - who are the end users of these technology.” The SMRT-NTU Smart Urban Rail Corporate Laboratory is one of 12 labs supported by the NRF, which facilitates the setting up of corporate labs via public-private partnerships. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-ntu-develop-new-systems-to-detect-train-door-faults-enhance-10663268"}, {"datetime": "29 Aug 2018 11:41AM", "tags": ["marine gas oil", "crime", "police"], "author": "", "title": "4 men arrested for allegedly stealing, selling marine gas oil", "content": " SINGAPORE: Four men have been arrested for allegedly misappropriating and selling marine gas oil to the crew of a foreign-registered vessel, the police said in a news release on Wednesday (Aug 29).

Investigations revealed that Ong had sublet an apartment unit to a Chinese national overstayer, Liu Hui, knowing that she would be staying and using the premises to provide sexual services. ICA said Liu has been dealt with for her overstaying offence, and has since been repatriated. ICA added that Liu had initially arrived in Singapore on Mar 11, 2018 to work as a performing artiste but then chose to work as a freelance masseur. Liu continued to remain in Singapore to work illegally upon the expiry of her visit pass on Mar 25, 2018.

Speaking at the Workplace Safety and Health Conference, she said: “The objective is not so much to penalise the laggards but to encourage those who do well to keep up their efforts.” The information could also allow goods and service buyers to compare their different WSH performance when making procurement decisions, she added. “This will give substance to the idea that good WSH is good for business, and promote greater ownership of WSH outcomes at all levels of the company, particularly at the top.” Another area that needs transforming is how workplaces manage the health of their workers. She said while the impact of work on the health of workers has been addressed, a less familiar dimension is how the health condition of a worker can impact safety and productivity at work. For example, workers with chronic conditions such as diabetes may experience dizziness or poor vision while handling machinery. This can lead to serious accidents and they may injure themselves or others. To address this, the WSH Council and the Health Promotion Board are collaborating to encourage companies to adopt a Total WSH approach, she said. This would improve both workers’ safety and health holistically such as by training WSH officers and occupational health professionals to integrate and manage both safety and health risks. Technology advancements such as data analytics, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence can also be used to advance WSH outcomes, Mrs Teo said. Virtual reality, for example, can be used to create simulated worksites for those who encounter safety and health risks at work. These learning opportunities can be made “bite-sized” to make it convenient for adult-learners and help develop good WSH habits through periodic reminders and learning. On its part, Mrs Teo said MOM has started to transform its regulatory approach to promote greater ownership for WSH among companies. It found that a combination of benchmarking information and enforcement encouraged better safety practices and ownership of WSH standards. Last year, the ministry tested different ways to inspect workplaces based on design thinking and behavioural insights with “interesting” results, said Mrs Teo. While surprise inspections have been the mainstay in its WSH strategy, MOM also informed companies who scored poorly in the assessment. “Many bosses had not realised that they fared poorly compared to their peers.

Each ASEAN member state is also subject to different pulls and pressures from bigger powers, he said.  “In these circumstances, all the more members must stay united and strive to maintain our cohesion and effectiveness.”  On RCEP, ASEAN has “exerted significant effort” to make progress.  Involving ASEAN and six Asia-Pacific countries, the trade pact builds upon the existing five ASEAN Plus One Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to strengthen economic linkages, and enhance trade and investment flows. The 16 members have previously set a year-end goal for the RCEP.  Mr Lee said: “Given the diversity of RCEP’s members, we all have to make trade-offs and compromises. But we should weigh these against the significant strategic and economic value of the RCEP.”  “The RCEP negotiations have continued for some time, and have now reached a critical stage. After a great deal of work, the possibility of substantively concluding the RCEP negotiations is finally in sight,” he added.  Describing it as “an important signal to the world”, Mr Lee urged RCEP member countries to “take a long-term view, keep up the momentum, engage constructively and with maximum flexibility” for a high quality agreement to be delivered this year.  Mr Lee also stressed how important it was for ASEAN to press on with the full implementation of the AEC Blueprint 2025. “This will enable ASEAN businesses to operate more seamlessly across the region, and make our companies, and also our economies more competitive globally,” he said. ASEAN CANNOT BE DISTRACTED BY POLICY U-TURNS ELSEWHERE: CHAN CHUN SING  Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is the AEM chairperson, echoed similar sentiments in his welcome remarks.  He said ASEAN has stayed the course in regional economic integration despite rising nationalistic tendencies and anti-trade sentiments elsewhere in the world.  Singapore’s ASEAN chairmanship comes at a “critical juncture” as further steps are taken to shape the grouping into a \"cohesive organisation capable of adapting to a more complex and uncertain global environment, and an economic bloc that is prepared to capitalise on future opportunities”, he added.  There has been progress in areas such as developing digital connectivity in the region, said Mr Chan.  For instance, the development of the ASEAN digital space and a transition to the “live” operation of the ASEAN Single Window in January for five member states.  ASEAN leaders have also agreed to work on the Digital Trade Standards Cooperation Initiative - a joint development by ASEAN and Australia.  \"These achievements are testament to ASEAN’s unwavering vision and commitment to create a more integrated AEC for the continued prosperity of our businesses and people,\" he said.  Moving forward, ASEAN must continue to build on these successes and cannot afford to be distracted by \"recent policy U-turns elsewhere\", Mr Chan added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/asean-regional-comprehensive-economic-partnership-pm-lee-10662722"}, {"datetime": "29 Aug 2018 07:48AM", "tags": ["Team Singapore", "Asian Games", "Contract bridge"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Contract bridge a game of skill, not luck: Singapore's Asian Games gold medallists tell detractors ", "content": " JAKARTA: At the 2018 Asian Games, contract bridge is a marathon of sorts.    Especially for the men's team event - the schedule is relentless. Seven hours a day, for seven straight days, competitors sat at tables in a cold room and attempted to baffle their opponents.  \"It's like a long marathon,\" said Poon Hua, one of the six members of the Singapore team, who all made history by winning the country's first gold medal for the sport at the Asian Games.  \"For the whole seven days, we had to mentally calculate all the probabilities, all the deductions, trying to decipher what our opponents were trying to do and try to outsmart and outwit them,\" said the 37-year-old, who is a full-time professional contract bridge player.  And that was just the competition phase. The team members, four of whom have other full-time jobs, spent an average of 15 hours a week over the last six months training for this tournament.  Physics teacher Zhang Yu Kun stressed that the hours the team devoted to training was more than many other athletes.  \"The career of a bridge player is generally longer than most sports, we can play until we're 80,\" he said. \"So we're talking about a disciplined effort over the years after work in the evenings - time we could have spent resting with family.\" The team believed that the effort and sacrifice were necessary because they knew that nothing would hone their skills more than consistent practice.  Fong Kien Hong, who is an electrical engineer, stressed that contract bridge is not a game where one relies on Lady Luck to win.  \"It's not like mahjong or monopoly ... The element of luck is totally eliminated in contract bridge,\" said the 41-year-old.   \"There are two teams playing duplicated sets of cards at both tables, so you cannot say one team is luckier than the other.\" He added: \"When you talk about mahjong, you talk about the role of the dice. And in games like poker, sometimes you get good cards, there's some element of luck.  \"In contract bridge, when you talk about luck, it's about the path to making the contract, not about the cards we are dealt with.\" The team stressed that the \"misconception\" that contract bridge is not a sport exists in Singapore because many Singaporeans play an alternate version of the game, called floating bridge. This game, commonly termed as bridge, has no fixed partnerships and the cards are dealt randomly.  \"It has similar mechanics but is different from contract bridge,\" said Poon.  \"The element of luck is absent in contract bridge. Singaporeans don't really understand what contract bridge is about; it's a misconception and they link the game we won gold in to this version of the game they used to play in school.\" MUST YOU PERSPIRE IN SPORT? The team captain Loo Choon Chou also spoke out against comments by netizens after the team's triumph.  He pointed out that some people argued that bridge should not be considered a sport at the Asian Games because it does not test physical exertions.  \"I think we can all agree that bridge is a mind sport, different from physical sports like football and rugby ... I think there should be more recognition (for bridge as a sport),\" said the 35-year-old, who is also a full-time contract bridge professional.  His teammate Poon reiterated that how much one perspires is a narrow way of defining whether an activity can be considered a sport.  \"What makes a sport a sport? How about competitiveness against rivals? Team spirit? There are so many things that define an activity as a sport.  \"We don't really know where to draw a line. Sports like horse-riding and shooting and bowling, you don't perspire a lot. Perspiration isn't a good definition,\" he said.  When the team was asked if they thought of themselves to be on par with Singapore Olympic champion swimmer Joseph Schooling, the country's only other gold medallist at the Asian Games, the team chuckled and looked briefly embarrassed.  \"If you compare us with Joseph Schooling, definitely we feel very proud to be in the same league as him,\" said Poon.  \"But when you look at his Olympic gold medal, we then realise that we are far from comparison.\"  Get the widest coverage of the 18th Asian Games (Aug 18 – Sep 2) from Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia on Mediacorp.

If you guessed they’re the topics of expensive, popular cook books, I’m sure you’re probably right. But these three are items inscribed into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. UNESCO, also known as the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation, is responsible for the World Heritage List, to which the Singapore Botanic Gardens was added in 2015, recognising natural and cultural sites of outstanding and universal value. Less well-known is the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, comprising cultural practices and intangible elements which demonstrate the diversity of a place’s heritage. Nominations are put forward by states party to the 2003 Convention and decided on by a committee. There has been strong citizen support for Singapore’s hawker culture bid for inclusion into the list, which Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced was to be proposed in his National Day Rally speech last week. FOOD, AN EXPRESSION OF A COUNTRY, A PEOPLE Food serves purposes besides physical sustenance, having a socio-cultural significance. Culinary customs vary widely worldwide and food can be a marker of identity, helping to define a country and culture. Local and ethnic foods too are seen as an expression of a place and people. Food is central to identity at an ethnic and national level and has its own heritage, even though defining a national cuisine and determining ownership of national dishes are complicated by the myriad flavours and influences. Hawker fare in particular represents Singapore’s multiracial and cosmopolitan population, and has a relatively long history. It is a source of affordable food, on which many rely, and hawker centres are democratic and inclusive spaces shared by people of all backgrounds. Hawkers have clearly made a major contribution to Singapore’s food culture in the past and the integral part they play in current everyday life makes them highly appropriate as a nomination. The fact that they are found elsewhere in Asia and beyond, albeit differing by locality, does not invalidate the UNESCO submission. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CONCERNS ABOUT HOMOGENISATION Indeed, there may be disagreement about what exactly constitutes these categories of food worth preserving in the UNESCO list, but they are often perceived to be at risk from multinational production and food service companies.  The activities of these businesses generate fears about homogenisation and the imposition of foreign tastes alongside damage to domestic enterprises. Concerns have prompted endeavours globally to celebrate and conserve indigenous cuisines, although the local and global can co-exist. Globalisation has been shown to strengthen the desire to protect locally distinctive food cultures and the two interact in an ongoing process which is potentially constructive. The UNESCO list itself makes fascinating reading and confirms the many forms taken by intangible cultural heritage, much of which is under threat in the modern era.  Hence attempts at formal recognition and guardianship so that the world’s rich cultural heritage is available for the appreciation of future generations in a home state and more widely. These ideas resonate in Singapore where analysis of eating and dining habits sheds light on the history of the country, its geography and contemporary society as well as political and economic systems. SUSTAINING THE TRADE Growing popular and official awareness of the hawker centre’s vital role in Singapore are reflected in initiatives to sustain the trade, but there are uncertainties about what lies ahead. A successful listing might assist the campaign to ensure that hawkers have a future in light of acknowledged problems. Skills are being lost as older practitioners retire without passing on their expertise and younger Singaporeans tend to shun the job, deterred by the working conditions and remuneration. At the same time, there are grounds for optimism and young cooks are entering the sector in what the late Anthony Bourdain described as a “hip hawker” movement. Dining environments are also being updated with hawker centres designed to meet 21st century demands. Admission into the list would underline the significance of hawkers and enhance their status, perhaps encouraging more to consider it as a career. VALUE TO TOURISM There are also implications for tourism given that food is a tourist attraction and a theme in tourism promotion. Eating out is an entertainment for visitors, affording insights into a society’s culture and way of life. Food can be a primary motivation where gastronomy and culinary tourism cover a spectrum of engagement from serious to the more casual. Whatever their position, many tourists are looking for authentic experiences and hawker centre food meets this need. Singapore already has a reputation for street food, indicated by the featuring of hawker stalls in the Michelin Guide, but UNESCO listing might boost interest among outsiders and would be useful in Singapore Tourism Board’s marketing. The attitudes of some visitors, however, may be unaffected. The Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity is not as well publicised as the World Heritage List, selection for which can be a major stimulus for tourism development at destinations in a way exemplified by the Angor Wat in Cambodia. NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE HAWKER CULTURE The plan to propose hawker culture for UNESCO inscription is to be welcomed, yet clearly will not be enough to guarantee its continuation and other efforts should be maintained. It should also be noted that food cultures, encompassing hawkers, constantly evolve as production and consumption patterns respond to internal and external factors. While they are a type of cultural heritage and part of a living tradition, hawkers cannot and should not be trapped by the past. Modern hawkers must be allowed to keep up with the times, including raising prices in line with costs which seems to be a move resisted by patrons. Such increases should be accepted and may indeed be essential if hawking is to remain commercially viable. In addition, younger practitioners should feel free to experiment and innovate as well as specialise in familiar dishes. New hawker centre models should be explored.  Hawking is not only a representation of intangible cultural heritage, but a vital aspect of contemporary life which is of practical relevance to hawkers and their customers. Securing a balance between continuity, respecting the historical legacy, and change to meet the requirements of the present and future is a formidable challenge.

This was a student whom I had a proper teacher-student relationship with,” recounted the teacher, who wanted to be known as “Stacy”. “I felt even more insulted that he never bothered to apologise.” The boy, who was later called into the principal’s office, was part of a WhatsApp group chat with about 10 other boys who had been sharing upskirt photos and videos of teachers and students. Stacy, who had been a teacher for four years, took two days’ medical leave and five months to get over the incident. “I had no say in how the boys would be punished or what consequences they’d face, and it was very quickly swept under the rug,” she said. No disciplinary action was taken against the boys, and because they were minors, they were not charged either. The teacher has since left the school. In Singapore, an average of 100 police reports on upskirt crimes have been filed annually since 2013. More worryingly, there have been more than 500 insult of modesty cases every year, on average, since 2015. These include the use of spy cameras. The programme Talking Point explores the world of illicit filming, with videos that reveal what happens when such cameras are misused, and how women can protect themselves. (Watch the episode here.) HIDDEN CAMERAS ABOUND Being unwittingly filmed by covert cameras is becoming a serious issue here, and for every hidden camera found, there are potentially many more that go undetected. Websites showing such footage of women can easily be found. One particular site claims to have 30 million visitors a day, with at least 70 videos showing Singaporean women – many of whom were in various stages of undress in public places like toilets and changing rooms. Presumably these were shot with hidden cameras or smartphones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Asked if the footage can be taken down, the web administrator replied that it would be considered on a case-by-case basis. This means a complaint must be made, and the victims must be aware of the videos to begin with. Just last week, a 26-year-old man who was part of a voyeuristic video group pleaded guilty to recording obscene videos of women relieving themselves in the toilet. Spy cameras are accessible and cheap, and there seems to be no restrictions on buying them, which means they could be dangerous in the wrong hands. Some of these cameras sell for as low as S$5, and they are readily available online: A search through Amazon generated 7,000 hits, and on Lazada, more than 500,000 hits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mr Pieter Tjia, the chief executive officer of OMG Solutions, which sells more than 200 types of spy cameras in its shop, said many spy cameras could be found in the most common items, like clothes hooks and air fresheners. He has seen a 10 per cent year-on-year increase in sales of hidden cameras, partly because they are less intrusive than closed-circuit television cameras. His customers are mostly working adults who want to monitor their children, elderly family members or their domestic workers at home. Those who want cameras for perverted uses typically shop online, he said. “They don’t feel comfortable doing a walk-in because we have so many cameras, and we normally ask them for contact details after their purchase.” SOME DON’T THINK IT’S ILLEGAL Criminal lawyer Rajan Supramaniam, who has handled over 50 cases involving hidden cameras, has noticed the increasing number of cases of late. “Compared to my early days in practice … maybe it’s about five times more,” he said. What surprises him is that some perpetrators are unaware that it is illegal to upload, download and share voyeuristic photos and videos of women. “The law and the courts are, in fact, imposing very stiff sentences because (such cases) require a high degree of premeditation,” he said. But “most of the time, these cases go undetected”. Some have suggested regulating spy cameras, but the law “can’t keep up with the technology”. To regulate it 100 per cent is difficult,” he admitted. “Every country is struggling with this.” The Talking Point team managed to track down and speak to a perpetrator, an 18-year-old who confessed to uploading multiple upskirt videos on a porn website, and some of his footage has gained over 10,000 views. He disclosed that he films six to eight upskirt videos monthly and that he has been doing this for two years without being caught. He even tried to give Talking Point host Diana Ser some tips on taking such videos. As to why he is continuing with this activity, despite knowing that it is illegal and carries the risk of imprisonment, he said everything has a risk but he was doing it for the thrill. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF For victims, once video footage of them is shared online, it is virtually impossible to remove all traces. So how does one avoid being caught in a compromising position? Mr John Seng, a debugging specialist who has been in the business of counter surveillance and covert filming for 30 years, suggested ways to scan a room for spy cameras. For example, women should take note of the position of clothes hooks in a changing room. “Most hooks are always fixed at eye level or even higher,” he advised. “But if you see that the hook is fixed from the shoulder to the thigh level, then have a close examination of this hook, to see whether it’s a hidden camera (with a pinhole) or a real hook.” Usually, a bona fide clothes hook is screwed tight to the wall, so it would not drop off, whereas a spy camera would be mounted with double-sided tape. Inside shower cubicles, soap dispensers are popular with voyeurs. While these do dispense solution and look normal, women should be wary of those covered with tape, meant to hide a camera. WATCH: How they do it (2:49)  To be sure, one can remove the cover of the dispenser, and “if you see electronics, then this is the work of a voyeur,” said Mr Seng. Ms Anisha Joseph, who manages the Association of Women for Action and Research’s Sexual Assault Care Centre, said victims who discover pictures or videos of themselves should take snapshots of the website as evidence and then file a police report. They should also report the abuse to these online platforms. While some people may say that the damage these women suffer cannot be as great as rape, Ms Joseph, whose centre provides support services for those who have experienced sexual assault, disagreed. She said the shame that comes with online sexual abuse can be “much more”. “There’s a huge sense of loss of control that you feel in these kinds of cases because you just don’t know where your pictures are being shared and who’s doing what with those pictures,” she added.

Mr Kwan also implied in media interviews that he had returned to Singapore occasionally. “As far as we can ascertain, there are no records of him having entered Singapore since 2000, based on his known identifiers (e.g. name and date of birth),” MHA told Channel NewsAsia. “As travel records prior to 2000 have been archived on microfilm, it would require a massive manual search through voluminous records to ascertain if he had entered Singapore before 2000.” According to reports, Kwan had lived in Singapore until he was 11 before emigrating to Houston, Texas, and is now an American citizen.

The petition, titled \"revert route change for SBS bus service 14\", had garnered nearly 2,000 signatures as of Tuesday night (Aug 28), four days after it was started on change.org by user Ethan P. SBS Transit announced last week that bus service 14's route would be amended from Sep 9 to \"enhance commuters' connectivity to Buona Vista MRT station\". Instead of going along Dover Avenue and Dover Road, the bus service will travel along Commonwealth Avenue West and North Buona Vista Road and call at eight new bus stops along the way. Seven bus stops will, however, be skipped with the route amendment: Opp ACS Independent, Opp ACS Boarding Sch, Fairfield Meth Pr Sch, Opp Fairfield Meth Pr Sch, ACS Independent, S'pore Poly and Opp S'pore Poly. \"I feel that the announced route change does not help the commuters at Buona Vista MRT station greatly, as announced in the press release, yet it brings great inconvenience to the residents and students living and studying along Dover Road and Dover Avenue,\" said the petition. These changes, according to the petition, might mean that more parents might take their children to school by private transport, leading to traffic jams. \"These changes to service 14 may cause more parents to send their children to school by private transport daily, worsening the already atrocious jam along Dover Road in the morning and afternoon,\" it said. In addition, the petition asserted that the route change would not substantially benefit commuters of Buona Vista MRT station, as \"many of the stops covered by service 14 are already covered by other buses stopping at Buona Vista\". \"Most commuters that will benefit from the route change can already take a direct bus from Buona Vista Station, and thus will not greatly benefit from this change.

Jointly developed by Singapore and China under the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative G2G (government-to-government) project, the STC is a multimodal transport route linking Chongqing in western China to Singapore via rail and sea. The STC will provide new opportunities for ASEAN companies to tap into growing demand in western China, said Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (Aug 28). He was speaking on the second and final day of the FutureChina Global Forum and Singapore Regional Business Forum in Singapore, where growing connectivity between China and Southeast Asia was a key focus. Last year, bilateral trade between China and Southeast Asia reached a record high, totalling more than US$515 billion (S$701 billion). Chongqing Mayor Tang Liangzhi, who was speaking at the forum, noted that the STC has already reduced travel time between western China and Southeast Asia by two-thirds. ECONOMIES OF SCALE Mr Chan added that the STC is an open platform, as having more users will expand its network, build economies of scale, and benefit all by reducing costs. At a separate panel session in the afternoon, Mr Chan noted that it took Singapore \"very long\" to develop a new concept for partnering China on bilateral infrastructure projects. He referred to the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative as a \"breakthrough\" which departed from previous approaches, as it focused on developing networks that yield economies of scale, such as railroads, rather than on a specific property such as an industrial park or a city. \"Once upon a time, when we go and build an industrial park in China, somebody will say, 'why not I build an industrial park next door and I will give it cheaper rate and compete with you'. So if the company comes to industrial park A, it won’t go to industrial park B. It is a zero-sum game in some sense,\" he said. \"We asked ourselves: 'How do we transcend this concept, whereby the more people coming to join you in your project, the better it is?'. That’s why we went on an open concept, whereby we’re trying to build a network rather than an industrial park or a city.\" NEXT STEPS Mr Chan also spoke on the next steps for the project, including streamlining customs processes, improving last-mile connectivity, and developing a strong network of regional distribution centres. “With the cold chain (facilities) in place, we can also expect new types of goods that will be transported both North and South along the corridor,\" he said. \"What previously was impossible - the transport of perishable products from Southeast Asia into the inner western region of China - is now possible. What used to take three weeks, now will take one week and we continue to try to reduce this time even further.\" According to Mr Teo Siong Seng, Pacific International Lines managing director, the STC can potentially connect Singapore and Southeast Asia with more than 50 countries and some 100 ports on China’s Belt and Road Initiative. It can also serve as an alternative to conventional sea routes, said Kerry Logistics chairman George Yeo.   “The traditional link to the Pearl River Delta is hard to replace, because it is very developed, logistics costs are cheap. But China wants to develop the Southern Transport Corridor because this will open up inland provinces which are otherwise cut off,” noted Mr Yeo. Pacific International Lines and Kerry Logistics are investors of two Sino-Singapore joint venture companies formed to drive the development of the STC - the Sino-Singapore Chongqing Connectivity Solutions Company and the Sino-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Solutions Multimodal Logistics Company. The Chongqing Connectivity Initiative is also seen as an important part of China's drive to reduce the income disparity between its coastal and inland and Western regions. It does this by promoting greater trade in the regions and provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi and Gansu via Chongqing.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/asean-china-trade-to-receive-a-boost-with-southern-transport-10661022"}, {"datetime": "28 Aug 2018 07:56PM", "tags": ["accident", "Tuas"], "author": "", "title": "Trapped lorry driver rescued by SCDF after accident in Tuas", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 34-year-old lorry driver was rescued by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Tuesday (Aug 28) after being trapped in his vehicle following an accident involving the lorry and a trailer.

Mr Chan said this in his opening address to attendees of the Africa-Singapore Business Forum 2018 on Tuesday (Aug 28). Over 500 people from over 35 countries are expected to participate in the two-day forum which ends on Wednesday. In his speech, Mr Chan outlined the importance of promoting economic integration and cooperation against a backdrop of rising trade tensions and protectionism. \"I would like to encourage African businesses to engage Singapore as your partner in Asia, see Singapore not just for our domestic market, but see us also as a platform, as a launchpad for your business opportunities in Southeast Asia and beyond,” said Mr Chan. He added that Singapore's “strong connections at the government and business level makes it a good base from which African companies can explore and access Asia.\" According to Singstat, foreign direct investment from Africa into Singapore amounted to S$27.4 billion in 2016. Over 60 Singaporean firms operate in Africa, ranging from food manufacturing to digital payment services, and Enterprise Singapore - the government agency which helps businesses internationalise - is working to increase that number. It said a main challenge was managing risk. Global Markets Director, Middle East & Africa of Enterprise Singapore G Jayakrishnan said the agency works with people on the ground, validate African counterparties, as well as encourage companies to take up political risk insurance. “We have programmes for (that), there are ways to mitigate it, and get around the risk element of Africa,\" said Mr Jayakrishnan. In 2017, trade between Singapore and Africa amounted to S$9.78 billion according to data from Enterprise Singapore, while Singapore investment into Africa reached S$18.5 billion in 2016, making the republic its 7th largest trading partner. According to the United Nations, Singapore is Africa's largest Southeast Asian trading partner. Enterprise Singapore highlighted two growth engines in the areas of deepening digital capabilities and addressing Africa's manufacturing needs. According to a McKinsey report, Africa’s consumer spending is expected to reach US$2.1 trillion (S$2.86 trillion) by 2025, and that its e-commerce purchases are projected to hit US$75 billion (S$102 billion) in the same year. \"Africa’s rapid growth and thriving digital economy offers rich opportunities for Singapore companies seeking higher growth and market diversification,” said CEO of Enterprise Singapore, Mr Png Cheong Boon. At the event, an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) between Singapore and Gabon was signed, bringing the list of DTAs between Singapore and Africa to 13. A total of five memoranda of understandings in areas of digital, infrastructure and business services were inked between African and Singapore companies. One is a tie-up is between media analytics firm Graymatics, and IT company Crescentech to provide security and surveillance solutions in Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. President and CEO of Graymatics Abhijit Shanbhag said Enterprise Singapore has played a big role in the collaboration. \"Enterprise Singapore had organised a mission within Africa which we participated in within Kenya and within that, that was actually the start of a number of business engagements that we had in Africa,\" said Mr Shanbhag. Director of Strategy & Innovation for Crescentech, Dr Percy Opio, said \"Enterprise Singapore is very specific about who they want us to partner with, they want us to partner with organisations that have relevant solutions for our market.” “We believe that this process will not only provide solutions in Kenya, but Graymatics will also empower us,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-aims-to-be-a-gateway-to-asia-for-african-companies-10660904"}, {"datetime": "28 Aug 2018 07:26PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Teo Chee Hean", "environment", "water agreement"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Investment in water treatment plants needed to ensure ‘good flow of water’ for Singaporeans: DPM Teo", "content": " SINGAPORE: It is necessary to plan long-term and expand Singapore’s network of water treatment plants to ensure that the country always has “a good flow of water”, said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on Tuesday (Aug 28). He spoke during a visit to Changi Water Reclamation Plant, one of three such facilities which collects and treats water from the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS). The DTSS, an underground sewage “superhighway”, conveys used water islandwide to water reclamation plants where it will be treated and purified into NEWater. Phase 1 of the project was completed in 2008 and phase 2 is expected to be finished in 2025. “When it is completed in 2025, it would have taken more than 25 years and S$10 billion,” Mr Teo noted. “This is a very important project for us because our water needs continue to grow so we need to plan very very long term.” Mr Teo also said “steady investment” and new technologies are required in order to meet Singapore’s water needs. He cited the example of the Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) technology, which was retrofitted in existing tanks to allow water to be treated more efficiently. According to Changi plant’s general manager Low Pei Chin, the new technology allows waste water to be treated in fewer steps compared to conventional methods, and also produces better quality water. “Bringing in this MBR will increase the flow of the plant as well as provide much cleaner, much better inputs to our NEWater plant, achieving savings in energy and efficiency as well,” said Mr Teo. “These are some of the things we do on a long-term basis to make sure that we are able to ensure that Singaporeans always have a good flow of water.” WATER DEAL WITH MALAYSIA The issue of water security has been in the spotlight recently after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that the price of raw water being sold to Singapore is “ridiculous”. In an exclusive interview with Channel NewsAsia in June, Dr Mahathir added that Malaysia will study the matter and renegotiate the terms of the water supply deal with Singapore. When asked on Tuesday if Malaysia has officially approached Singapore regarding the water agreement, Mr Teo said no. He added that Singapore is not in any talks with Malaysia regarding the water deal. Under the current water agreement, signed in 1962, Singapore has the right to draw up to 250 million gallons (mgd) of raw water per day from the Johor River for 3 sen per 1,000 gallons of raw water. It sells treated water to Johor at 50 sen per thousand gallons.  This is a \"fraction of the cost\" to Singapore of treating the water, said Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament in July. Following Dr Mahathir’s remarks, Dr Balakrishnan also said that both countries must \"fully respect\" the sanctity of international agreements.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/water-treatment-plant-investment-needed-teo-chee-hean-10660258"}, {"datetime": "28 Aug 2018 07:25PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Twin sisters in viral 2015 Simei Green condo fight fined", "content": " SINGAPORE: A pair of twin sisters whose spat with two men at a condominium in Simei went viral in 2015 were sentenced to fines on Tuesday (Aug 28). Tang Lei, 50, who faced one charge more than her sister, was sentenced to a fine of S$2,500, while Tang Bei was fined S$2,100. They were found guilty of various charges of voluntarily causing hurt and of criminal force last month, after 20 days of trial. The twins had attacked a condominium manager and a security guard at Simei Green in a dispute over a condominium access card. Both of them spat in condo manager Colvin Quek Choon Kiat's face, while Tang Lei splashed the contents of a canned drink at him. The pair also hit security guard Bligh Charles Kenneth. The attack on Apr 28, 2015, was not Mr Quek's first encounter with Tang Bei. In February 2015, he spoke to Tang Bei as she was accused of tailgating others out of the side gate of the condo. She told him that it was none of his business and slipped out. She returned a day or two later and spoke to Mr Quek, but became aggressive when asked to provide some personal documents. She hit him a few times and threatened to sue him for molest, and Mr Quek lodged a police report over this incident. Molestation was one of the claims Tang Bei raised during the trial - she claimed that Mr Quek touched her breast, and re-enacted the scene. She also claimed that he had insulted her dignity as a lady and humiliated her country. Tang Lei, on the other hand, had claimed among other things that she had not thrown the can at Mr Quek, but that instead \"a hand knocked against the can and caused it to fly in his direction\". She also said that \"no saliva came out\" when she spat, and that it was her custom to make the spitting sound and ensure no saliva came out. The prosecution said that evidence against the twins was overwhelming, with the attack captured on two handphones. They added that the victims gave evidence in a \"candid and forthright manner\", while the sisters were \"nothing but belligerent and untruthful throughout the course of the trial\", with \"incredible, illogical and inconsistent accounts and explanations for their appalling behaviour\".

These were the findings from a longitudinal study on the retirement and healthcare needs of Singapore residents, the first two waves of which were carried out in 2014 and 2016. A subset of the respondents, totalling 7,200 people who are CPF members aged between 55 and 70, were asked if they had made cash withdrawals from CPF after turning 55 years old. About four in 10 respondents said they did not make any cash withdrawals after turning 55. \"A sizeable proportion did not make withdrawals after turning 55 years old, hence allowing their funds to continue earning higher CPF interest rates compared to bank savings deposit rates,\" the CPF Board said. According to the CPF Board, those who withdrew from their CPF funds - 58 per cent of members - took out a median amount of S$9,000. The average amount withdrawn was S$33,000. More than half of those who withdrew the money deposited it in a bank or finance company, said the CPF Board. The median amount deposited was about S$8,000, added the board. This trend of leaving withdrawals in bank savings accounts could \"indicate a desire for liquidity\" in the older cohorts as members could only make one withdrawal a year prior to 2014, the CPF Board said. CPF withdrawal rules have since relaxed and members can receive their withdrawals within a day through PayNow. Forty per cent of those who withdrew funds said they used the money for immediate needs like household expenses and loan repayments. The board noted that respondents in this group had more children on average or reported poorer health as compared to the rest of the people polled. Some had used the funds for their children's education expenses. \"A relatively higher proportion of members in this group also reported poorer health status, with some indicating that the funds withdrawn had been used to pay for medical expenses,\" the board said. The survey also revealed that about 16 per cent of CPF withdrawals was used on big-ticket items like overseas trips or home renovations. However, it was noted that a larger proportion of the respondents in this group were employed at the time of the survey.

The first batch of students, who graduated on Tuesday (Aug 28), comprised of 19 technicians from four operators. To engage students better and deepen their understanding, the course consists of augmented reality elements and hands-on coursework. For example, instead of working on a full bus model, as previously done, students now get to study the chassis of a bus in isolation. They also get to see the inside of how an engine works with the help of augmented reality classrooms. The certification supports the Land Transport Industry Transformation Map and the Skills Framework for Public Transport, both of which were launched in the first half of this year. The frameworks are focused on reskilling and upskilling workers in the bus sector. More than 900 bus technicians and engineers currently working in the industry will be recognised under the framework. Bus technicians can be certified under three levels of expertise - Technical Specialist, Senior Technical Specialist and Master Technical Specialist. The certification will be conducted twice a year, and will be conferred by the Land Transport Authority and the Institute of Engineers. Training and assessment will be conducted by the Singapore Bus Academy (SBA). The curriculum was created in consultation with experts from the industry. Previously, individual bus operators conducted their own training. At the launch, Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said: \"With newer technology adoption, such as electric and autonomous buses, such centralisation of training delivery helps to optimise resources, and ensures consistent delivery of core essential knowledge and skills.\" At the same time, the SBA is holding a bridging course for technicians who are new to the industry, and as a refresher for experienced technicians. The courses are run from the new Bus Technical Specialist Certification Centre in Ulu Pandan Bus Depot. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, National Transport Workers' Union Executive Secretary Melvin Yong said the launch of the certification would help enhance bus technical professionals' skills and job mobility. In addition, the new certification centre also plays an important role in \"ensuring that our bus technical professionals' skills continue to be relevant amidst changes brought about by the onset of electric and autonomous vehicles\", he said. Mr Yong added that the union would continue to work closely with public transport operators and industry partners and send bus professionals for certification. ​​​​​​​", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bus-technicians-certificate-launched-skills-framework-10660330"}, {"datetime": "28 Aug 2018 04:37PM", "tags": ["crime", "court", "national service"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Thai national returns to Singapore to face NS defaulting charges, pleads guilty", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 24-year-old Thai national who was formerly a Singapore citizen returned to Singapore and pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Aug 28) to defaulting on national service (NS).  Although he was born in Thailand, Ekawit Tangtrakarn became a Singapore citizen by registration when he turned a year old, the court heard. He largely lived in Thailand and lost his Singaporean citizenship in October 2015, as he had failed to take the Oath of Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty within 12 months of turning 21. After he completed his university studies in 2016, his Singaporean mother Genevieve Lim contacted the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and said that her son was ready to return to Singapore to face his NS-related offences. In court on Tuesday, Ekawit admitted to remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit from Apr 17, 2010, to Oct 16, 2015. Another similar charge of being outside Singapore without a valid exit permit from October 2006 to April 2010 will be taken into consideration during sentencing. ACCUSED'S MOTHER TRIED TO GET DEFERMENT, COULD NOT AFFORD BOND The court heard that Ekawit was issued with a Singapore passport, valid between 1994 and 2004, and then a second one which was valid between 2004 and 2006. Even though he was a Singapore citizen, Ekawit lived in Thailand and travelled to Singapore on multiple occasions, mostly using his Thai passport to travel. Ekawit's mother, Ms Lim, had several discussions with CMPB about her son's NS obligations. In her correspondence with CMPB, she said that her son decided to continue his education in Thailand, to which CMPB said that holding a foreign citizenship did not absolve him from his NS obligations. CMPB also told Ms Lim that they could not grant Ekawit deferment from NS pending the renunciation of his Singapore citizenship, and asked her to contact officials regarding her son's exit permit requirements for overseas studies. When told by CMPB that parents of boys aged between 13 and 16-and-a-half must furnish a bond if their sons intend to travel or remain outside of Singapore for three months or longer, Ms Lim said she did not have enough money. This bond would be in the form of a bank guarantee of a minimum S$75,000, or 50 per cent of the combined annual gross income of the boy's parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher. CMPB reminded Ms Lim that Ekawit needed a valid exit permit, and that remaining outside the country without one was an offence punishable with a maximum of three years' jail and a fine of up to S$10,000. In February 2008, a Police Gazette cum Blacklist was raised against Ekawit. Several years later, in 2014, CMPB informed Ms Lim in an email that her son had been classified as an NS defaulter for remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit. Ms Lim responded, seeking advice on the matter. After Ekawit lost his Singapore citizenship in October 2015, he was no longer liable for NS.  He received his university degree in 2016 and returned to Singapore in July that year, where investigations found that one of the reasons he returned to the country was to avoid any trouble should he need to travel to Singapore in the future for work. HE IS NOW AN ENGINEER IN THAILAND, WANTS TO RESOLVE MATTER: DEFENCE He now works as an engineer in Thailand, Ekawit's lawyer S Radakrishnan told Channel NewsAsia. Mr Radakrishnan said Ekawit wanted to return to Singapore to resolve the matter as he did not want to be in hiding. Asked if it had anything to do with recent news on Crazy Rich Asians author Kevin Kwan defaulting on his NS obligations, Mr Radakrishnan said: \"There's nothing to do with it, his case has been dragging on for a few months.\" Calling it an unusual case, he asked for only a fine to be imposed, saying that Ekawit identifies as a Thai national and did not take advantage of any benefits of his Singaporean citizenship. He also said that his family was not well-to-do and could not afford the bond to secure an exit permit. \"The accused had no intention to apply for or obtain Singapore citizenship in the future,\" said Mr Radakrishnan. \"After the present matter is concluded, he hopes to return to Thailand and intends to continue to live and work in Thailand for the foreseeable future.\" However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Mansoor Amir said that not being able to afford the bond was not a mitigating factor, as Ekawit's parents should have asked him to return to Singapore if that were so. \"Treating this as a mitigating factor would create the perception that others in the accused person’s shoes can simply not apply for an exit permit on account of being unable to afford the bond and thereafter externalise the consequences of this failure by receiving a sentencing discount,\" said the prosecutor. He said that Ekawit's voluntary surrender and plea of guilt would grant him a five-week discount, noting that Ekawit had remained outside Singapore without a valid exit permit for five-and-a-half years.

Experts that Channel NewsAsia spoke to welcomed this rule change, saying that it gives prospective homeowners more choices when it comes to mortgage decisions and planning for other needs, such as childbearing and retirement.  “This gives flat buyers the flexibility to decide on the loan quantum using HDB loans,\" said Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo from the National University of Singapore (NUS).   \"They are also able to take advantage of a higher interest rate for the first S$20,000 savings in the CPF OA.\" At the moment, CPF members can earn interest rates of up to 3.5 per cent per annum on their OA, while mortgage rates for Housing Board loans have remained steady at 2.6 per cent a year.  Referring to the interest rate difference, Assoc Prof Sing noted that buyers who do not use up the money in their OAs can “earn the difference” and subsequently use it to make monthly mortgage instalments in times of need.  OrangeTee & Tie’s head of research and consultancy Christine Sun said: “We do know that when it comes to buying private properties, there are people who choose to not use up everything in their OA and take up a bank loan instead.  \"But that was not available to HDB flat buyers previously, so I think it’s a good move to give them that option now.\"  Ms Sun also reckoned that the new policy will help to give HDB homeowners “some buffer” in the event of unforeseen financial difficulties. Echoing that, PropNex Realty’s CEO Ismail Gafoor singled out those who are retrenched or in transition between jobs as the main beneficiaries.  “This way, the surplus in their account allows them to sustain their upcoming instalments in the next few months,\" he said. Observers also think that the rule change may help to nudge Singaporeans to set aside more of their CPF monies for retirement, instead of directing it all into housing.  “I think the bigger purpose is to help people plan for the longer term, like retirement, and to have something on standby,” said Ms Sun.  However, there could be a downside when some flat buyers over-extend themselves financially by taking up bigger home loan packages.  “The flip side of the policy is that buyers will have to take larger loan quantums and this adds to the costs of financing over the loan periods,” said Assoc Prof Sing, who is the director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at NUS.  “With the larger loan, buyers will also have to pay higher monthly debt services.”  Nevertheless, he added that the risk “should be small” given that the concessionary interest rate for HDB mortgage loans has been relatively stable, compared to commercial bank rates that fluctuate.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cpf-ordinary-account-rule-change-for-hdb-loans-10659792"}, {"datetime": "28 Aug 2018 02:38PM", "tags": ["SMRT", "public transport"], "author": "", "title": "Man to be charged for assaulting SMRT employee at Raffles Place station", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 21-year-old man will be charged for assaulting an SMRT service ambassador at Raffles Place MRT station, said the police on Tuesday (Aug 28) in a news release.

During his time of employment with Frasers Centrepoint Property Management & Services - between 1998 and June 2017 - Abdul Rahim rose from being a senior technician to a facilities supervisor.  Based in Alexandra Point, one of the properties managed by Frasers, Abdul Rahim was tasked with maintaining the building and ensuring that day-to-day operations were carried out.  He could also award jobs to contractors on Frasers' approved vendor list. In 2011, Abdul Rahim set up a company named Fatal Express Facility Services, along with an accomplice Loh Boon Wah, to secure jobs from Frasers. He knew that he could not be seen to be associated with the firm, and so Loh was named as director of Fatal instead, the court heard. Abdul Rahim successfully awarded 112 Frasers contracts to his own company between 2011 and 2017, with Frasers paying Fatal S$89,570. He and Loh split the profits obtained. Abdul Rahim was also charged for asking for a S$100 bribe from a contractor performing sealant works at Alexandra Point in 2016. PROSECUTION ASKED FOR 7 CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES The prosecution asked for a jail sentence of 12 months, adding that seven of the sentences should run consecutively as the offences were committed over seven years. Abdul Rahim's defence lawyer Emily Loh asked for leniency, saying that his father had heart disease and depended on him. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Ang Siok Chen argued that family circumstances or hardship were not mitigating factors unless the case was exceptional, and pointed out that Abdul Rahim was not the sole breadwinner of the family. In sentencing, District Judge Marvin Bay noted that Loh, who has been charged, left the criminal enterprise \"ironically named Fatal Express\" in 2017, but Abdul Rahim continued in it. He added that there were \"serious aggravating factors\" for the cheating charges, with an abuse of trust, as Abdul Rahim was a long-time employee trusted by Frasers.  The judge also said there was premeditation, with Abdul Rahim contriving to shield his own identity and roping in Loh. In addition to the 11-month jail term, Abdul Rahim was handed a fine of S$1,000 and a penalty of S$100.  The judge said he ordered five sentences run to consecutively instead of seven as requested by the prosecution as Abdul Rahim had no notable antecedents.

On a separate occasion, a Facebook post that went viral drew my attention.  Someone asked one of their interns to top up the paper in the copying machine as it was empty. The intern did just that but it still won’t print. A few seconds of CSI revealed that the intern had indeed loaded the ream of paper into the machine … with the packaging intact. I guess the intern took his reference from how things work from a Nespresso machine. An epic facepalm moment for many but I don’t really find it surprising. I had opportunities to give talks at many different schools over the years. The buildings and locations might be different but one thing is constant - the undergrads are very “lepak” (relaxed). They are simply there to clock credits, not so much to learn. At first I thought it was me and my monotonous, not newscaster-ready dictation voice.  But a quick check with the organising lecturer gave me relief - I’m not the only one (that faces nonchalant students, not the voice thing). And if you think those are isolated cases, I have seen it at university career fairs too - with huge, visible differences between local and foreign students. The foreign students would be queuing up outside the school hall, waiting anxiously with their pens and notebooks. Once the gate is opened, they would rush from booth to booth, scribbling down pages after pages of notes. On the other hand, the local students would stroll in just before lunch and after their sleep in. Wandering around in their flip flops, they would peer around for a few minutes and go off to their brunch. But I get it. Internships can be a boring bag of stuffs - made worse if the internship was derived from a discipline that you aren’t really passionate about. Whatever the case it, the past is fixed but the future is waiting for us to mould.  FRESH CHALLENGES For any intern, an internship represents the best possible opportunity to get a headstart in your career and possibly the best way to land a job without all the discrimination and trauma of a job interview. One of my better hires was an intern who really went beyond her call of duty. She completed her internship with flying colours, went back to complete her third year and we hired her as a full-time staff right away. This is her 10th year with the company.  But that was 2008. At the point where we are today, and with the prevalence of automation, jobs are going to get harder to come by. According to a study of 46 countries and 800 occupations by the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million global workers will lose their jobs by 2030 and be replaced by automation. Yet starting salaries for fresh uni grads continue to hit new highs. According to the annual survey of graduates from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and Singapore Management University, fresh grads who found a job took home a median monthly salary of S$3,400, up from S$3,300 in 2016. Companies can do the math. Increasingly many have switched to hiring people outside of Singapore as they are much cheaper and have the required skills.  Whether to hire a developer in India, or a support staff in Batam, cost-cutting efforts are escalating as businesses grapple with other cost factors that have little alternatives or can’t be outsourced (including rental, or the boss’ Mercedes). GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT But this cross junction represents a great opportunity for interns who already have a foot in the door to impress the heck out of your potential future employer. Every one of my past interns who left a great impression share a few common traits - they will ask “what else do you need me to do”, they sincerely apologise when they mess up and they truly want to learn. That means a lot in a corporate environment where taiji masters abound. At the end of the day, if interns give themselves a chance and take the opportunity to get serious about their internships, their employers will naturally reciprocate.  It still might be mind-numbing work, and the office might not have the kind of pantry that Google or Facebook does, but it teaches you to level up when things are down and out. Then, you can truly excel when things are going your way and get something out of your internship experience - if not a job, at least a stirling recommendation letter.

But Mr Ng, whose estate will be among the first in Singapore to reach lease expiry in less than six decades, was among many Housing and Development Board (HDB) owners who got jittery when the Government made clear last year that not all old flats will be automatically eligible for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers), and their prices will come down as their leases dwindle. The HDB resale market was also spooked by the authorities’ comments as prices fell for six consecutive quarters, before inching up in the second quarter of this year. Following the National Day Rally (NDR) and the ensuing housing announcements, the mood of homeowners including Mr Ng has been somewhat lifted. Mr Ng said he feels more assured now, as the initiatives will “cushion” the depreciation of ageing flats, and help to protect their value. “It’s better than zero,” he said, referring to the prospect of his flat becoming worthless when the 99-year lease is up. Property agent Noor Ally, who is handling the sale of a flat at Chai Chee Avenue, agreed that the announcements have provided some comfort for several of his clients.  “(They) know that there is still some value in their (ageing property). While they are still keen on selling, they also know that there are options - like possibly returning it to the Government (through VERS),” he added. Lease expiry is a challenging issue faced by policymakers in all countries with public housing programmes including China and the United Kingdom for example. To deal with the politically sensitive issue, China, for instance, resorted to automatically renewing the lease of residential land in the eastern city of Wenzhou when it expired last year. In Singapore, where more than 80 per cent of the resident population live in HDB flats, the lease expiry is an even bigger political hot potato, analysts had previously said. After two years in the making — and much hand-wringing by anxious homeowners — Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong presented at last Sunday’s NDR the Singapore solution to the complex issue. RAFT OF MEASURES At the rally, which is widely seen as the most important political speech of the year, Mr Lee devoted a significant portion of his address on the HDB lease expiry issue. Among other things, he explained that the lease duration cannot be extended \"easily\", and it is better that the Government take back housing blocks when leases expire, demolish them and rebuild new flats for future generations. Public housing flats are sold with 99-year leases because the government has to be fair to future generations and guard against Singapore from becoming a society split into the haves and the have-nots, said Mr Lee. He announced a new Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) which will be rolled out in about 20 years. HDB estates built in the 1970s such as Marine Parade, Bedok and Ang Mo Kio could be among the first in line to undergo VERS. Unlike the existing Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), which is decided by the HDB and residents don't get to vote, VERS will be open to voting. HDB flat owners get to decide if they want the authorities to take back their apartments for redevelopment at around the 70-year mark of their lease. If they vote to go ahead, the Government will buy back their blocks of flats to redevelop the precinct and the owners may use the sale proceeds to pay for another flat. Otherwise, they continue to live in their homes until the lease runs out. Every HDB flat can also expect to undergo major upgrading twice during its 99-year lease period, with the new Home Improvement Programme (HIP) II rolled out for ageing units at the 60- to 70-year mark. At the same time, the HIP scheme — which currently covers flats built up to 1986 — will be extended to blocks constructed up to 1997. Last Monday (Aug 20), National Development Minister Lawrence Wong announced a review of the CPF financing rules on the buying of older flats, and the extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme to five-room and larger flats. Currently, CPF members cannot use their savings to buy a flat if its remaining lease is less than 30 years. There are also restrictions if they want to use their funds to purchase flats with less than 60 years on its lease, effectively limiting the pool of eligible buyers. Mr Wong had also said last week that even though many details for VERS will not be ready for some time, the Government felt that it \"owed\" Singaporeans an early explanation on its thinking for the next phase of public housing. Experts interviewed said that by airing its thoughts on the complex issue early, the Government achieved another objective: To restore some calm in the HDB resale market, and provide reassurance to homeowners. “(It is saying) ‘calm down first, please don’t panic, I’ve got schemes,’” said Suntec Real Estate Consultants director of research and consultancy Colin Tan. Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo added:  The assurance is in the form of the Government’s obligation to acquire back those blocks where residents have voted for and supported VERS. Assoc Prof Sing, the director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at the National University of Singapore (NUS), reiterated that this gives homeowners “a right to sell their depreciating assets with decaying leases back to the government, where they may find it difficult to sell the older flats (with limited residual leases) in the resale market”. A MULTI-PRONG APPROACH FOR A MULTI-FACETED ISSUE While experts have said that the devil is in the details as far as VERS is concerned, they noted that the long-term housing initiatives serve to tackle different aspects of the lease expiry issue. And in a property market where sentiments drive behaviour, some of the impact can be seen in the near to medium term, even though implementation is some time away. Taken as a whole, the measures will help to preserve — if not boost — the value of ageing HDB flats, among other outcomes. This helps to reduce the panic among homeowners while increasing demand from prospective buyers, said analysts. For Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) economist Walter Theseira, the measures address a “common problem” — the danger that the resale market for very old flats will become “effectively non-existent in the future”. “That is a huge policy problem if it happens, because it means homeowners are locked in – they won’t be able to move because they can’t sell their flats,” said Dr Theseira. “Why is this a danger? Well, the problem is that people won’t buy older flats if they can’t get financing — which the CPF (review) will address — and if they believe the older flat will be forgotten by policymakers and hence will deteriorate rapidly — this is what HIP II and VERS address.” VERS, in particular, “may prove to be very useful, because it means that if demand for very old flats is very low, the Government can support the market to give owners options for mobility”, Dr Theseira said. “We have to remember how important housing mobility is and why being able to sell your flat is key to that … if people can’t move closer to work, for their kid’s schools, near their parents or relatives, etc, it means people are stuck,” added Dr Theseira, who noted that the vast majority of Singaporeans need to sell their flat to move, either because of HDB rules or they cannot afford to hold two properties simultaneously. Agreeing, Fengshan Member of Parliament (MP) Cheryl Chan, who had earlier spoken about the lease expiry issue in the House, pointed out that VERS and HIP II provide options for flat owners “who have difficulty disposing their flats in resale market or who wish to live near their families or at other precincts in Singapore”. Mr Tan explained that given the finite use of a HDB flat, owners would be guessing “when is the most opportune time to sell their flat and re-invest in a new flat to store their savings”. The initiatives help to alleviate concerns by stretching or delaying the “optimum sell date” as the Government continually adds value to a flat, he said. On VERS specifically, Professor Sumit Agarwal from NUS Business School felt that it prevents residents worried about the falling value of their ageing flats from engaging in a competition with their neighbours on who manages to sell their units first — and hence, get the best price. “There won’t be a tug-of-war of dropping prices. It gives a people a reason to wait (till the flat reaches the 70-year mark),” he added. Assoc Prof Sing reiterated that while VERS would slow down the rate of depreciation of older flats, HIP II would keep up the quality and living conditions of these units. How VERS and HIP II will complement each other remains to be seen, as authorities iron out the details. Some observers have pointed out that it could be a waste of resources for estates to be upgraded via HIP II, only to be sold back to the Government. But Assoc Prof Sing felt that the two schemes are likely to serve different groups: Residents who are not willing to sell their flats back to the Government under VERS may then see their units undergo HIP II, which allows them to continue living in their spruced-up flats. On the demand side, Cushman and Wakefield Singapore head of research Christine Li wrote in one commentary that the plans “will help prospective buyers look at resale HDB flats differently”. Coupled with the possible relaxation of CPF usage, VERS could lead to flat-buyers “becoming less sensitive” to declining HDB leases, she said.  “This could spur demand for older flats in mature estates ... (and) sellers of these ageing flats are now in a stronger position to hold on to their asking prices,” she added. Other experts, including Mr Tan, stressed the need for the loosening of CPF financing rules to breathe new life into the demand for ageing flats. COMPENSATION: A VITAL PIECE OF THE JIGSAW With all the main pieces laid out, experts said a key piece of the jigsaw puzzle is the compensation for homeowners under VERS. This was also borne out from interviews with residents living in older estates who said the amount of money which they would be getting from the Government in return for their units is the top concern on their minds. “How do they determine the offer price? Nobody knows (at this point),” said Mr Andrew Soh, 59, who has been living in Marine Parade for the past four years. At the NDR, Mr Lee said the terms for VERS “will be less generous than SERS, because there will be less financial upside”. Mr Wong has cautioned against speculation over the VERS compensation package and which estates would be selected for the scheme.  \"It would be rash to rush into details now when some of these things can only happen decades from now,\" he said. \"We have 20 years to prepare, so let's not get too excited.” Under SERS, the Government earmarks a HDB precinct for redevelopment. According to the HDB’s website, compensation for homeowners will be based on the market value of the flat at the point of the SERS announcement, and “reasonable expenses” to help them move to new replacement flats nearby. Amid the debate on the lease expiry issue, some observers — including Ms Chan — have suggested getting private developers into the picture. Among other things, this could result in higher compensation for homeowners. During the debate on the President’s Address in May, Ms Chan suggested allowing private developers to “top up the land lease of HDB flats for future development”. Following the latest announcements, Ms Chan said HDB can consider having precincts designated for VERS to be potentially redeveloped by private developers. This could make VERS an attractive option for homeowners, subjected to certain conditions, she said. “Over time, the Government can also consider taking back leasehold private land plots and re-designating them for public housing. This will ensure better social mix of private and public housing on the long run,” she added. While some experts welcomed the idea, others cautioned against it. Referring to the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) which has been suspended indefinitely by the Government, Dr Theseira said: History has shown that when private developers are involved with public housing — like the DBSS — at the end of the day, the public still expects the Government to take responsibility for any shortcomings. Under the DBSS, developers have to bid for the open land tender and take charge of the entire process of flat design, construction and sale. It was first rolled out in 2005, but suspended six years later following a public outcry over the high selling prices. Dr Theseira warned that private developers “will only redevelop an area if they believe they can sell the new units for a profit”, after paying the Government and the residents. This may lead to a vicious circle of rising HDB prices, he said. Assoc Prof Sing said that while private developers can bring in new ideas and ease the Government’s financial outlay on VERS, there will be trade-offs.  “Developers are commercial driven. It’s one part of the reason why DBSS didn’t take off,” he said. Echoing Dr Theseira’s concern, he noted that private developers will demand “a sufficient return” for any involvement in VERS. In any case, the margins for a public housing project would be too low for a private developer, Prof Sumit pointed out. Still, CBRE head of research Desmond Sim said it would be a good idea to get the private sector onboard VERS, if the Government can build in safeguards. This means not letting private developers dictate the land costs, and rebuilding costs, he suggested. NO PERFECT SOLUTION Given the complexity of the lease expiry issue and the significant impact it has on Singaporeans, the need for safeguards extends beyond any potential involvement of the private sector. With policymakers hammering out the details in the coming years, Mr Sim stressed the need for the various schemes to be “equitable in nature”. “At the end of the day, (the authorities) need to make sure that there are rules ... that will cut off speculation (by investors looking for a windfall),” he said. To further protect the interest of the public, Mr Sim said the guidelines in general for VERS need to be stricter than en bloc sales for private property, because “we are dealing with a larger public here”. Nevertheless, Ms Chan felt that the requisite minimum approval for VERS should be lower than the 80 per cent threshold for collective sales in the private property market. “There being fewer rules to protect (private property) owners … it makes sense to have en bloc decision determined by the vast majority of owners,” she added. Indeed, Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency MP Alex Yam was among those who had expressed concerns that the acrimony among residents in some private en bloc attempts may spill over to public housing estates going through Vers. Mr Yam, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for National Development, had questioned:  What sort of percentile are you looking at? Are you looking at the same as the private sector? How do you address the concerns of those who, after going through the VERS, find that they have become in one way or another disenfranchised with this flat? For all the assurance that VERS provides as a lifeline for owners of ageing flats, the need for voting, however, takes the decision out of their hands, some residents noted. Mr Ng felt he would “no longer be able to act independently” as a homeowner while his neighbour, Mdm Lim Choo Hin, 56, said it means she does not “have control over (her) own property”. While most residents and analysts welcomed the Government’s ambitious public housing plans, they acknowledged that lease expiry remains a complex issue with no perfect solution. Many details need to be worked out, they said. In her commentary, Ms Li noted that a big step has been taken in the right direction, “although the newly announced schemes are still in their infancies”. “The Government has cleared the air about the fate of HDB flats and sent an important signal – finding the right solution has been a top priority for the Government over the last couple of months and will still be in decades to come,” she added. For residents like Mr Soh, at least now they see light at the end of the tunnel. “If (we have to) wait until the 99-year lease expires some 40 to 50 years later, nobody can see (what is going to happen),” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-99-year-lease-decay-singapore-government-solutions-10656310"}, {"datetime": "28 Aug 2018 06:00AM", "tags": ["container truck drivers", "PSA International"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Fragmented container trucking business ripe for change, but painful roadblocks await  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Container truck driver, Mr Yusof Ahmad, heard a “popping” sound as he was climbing down from the cabin of his prime mover. “I was getting down when one leg went one direction, and the other one didn’t follow,” the Singaporean told Channel NewsAsia. He found out later that he had torn his meniscus. Mr Yusof said picking up and delivering containers can take a physical toll on him and other drivers, given that many of them are elderly. At 49, the driver said his age is “average” among the drivers he has met, but there are many in their 60s, following the revision of the age limit for driving heavy vehicles in 2015. Mr Harry Hew, managing director of Union Transport, which also has a container trucking business, corroborated this. He told Channel NewsAsia in a separate interview that among his six Singaporean drivers, the youngest is 55 years old and the oldest, 64. The physical toll on a greying driving pool is but one of the many challenges the traditional container trucking sector is grappling with as it attempts to reinvent itself in order to remain relevant in the digital age.   THE CHALLENGE IS NOT JUST PHYSICAL  The mental toll is another challenge faced by prime mover drivers like Mr Yusof, who has been working for a small container trucking company for the past two years. Another is keeping the sleep monster at bay. The long journey involved in transporting a container from Tuas to Changi, for example, meant that he “can get sleepy” while on the roads, Mr Yusof admitted. “Short trips not so bad, you get up get down, that (makes you) wake up.” It’s not just staying awake though. Speed plays a part too. Given that he is paid per trip, the quicker Mr Yusof makes a delivery, the better. Channel NewsAsia spent a morning with the container truck driver and in that time, he moved a container from Bulim Avenue to Gul Circle before heading to Jalan Buroh to pick up another trailer to haul another container. He then drove over to a yard at Pioneer Road to pick up a container that was meant for Jurong Island. He also had to contend with the difficulty of finding parking on a two-lane road leading to the container yard at Pioneer Road. There are three container yards in close proximity and the stretch of road can become quite congested with trucks waiting their turn to get in. It took an hour to pick up the container from the yard, something Mr Yusof said was “quite fast already” considering we could have been stuck there for hours. His working hours vary, depending on the number of containers the company has to move, but it is about 12 hours on average - the maximum stipulated hours by the Ministry of Manpower. He admitted though that there days when he would drive longer than that.  The issue of overwork among heavy vehicle drivers was placed under the spotlight by a Talking Point episode during which some drivers recounted having to work beyond the 12-hour limit set by the law and migrant workers being threatened to be sent home when complaining of fatigue to their bosses. Amid it all, Mr Yusof shared that he hoped to keep driving for another five to 10 years as his younger son is still in school and the older one is pursuing varsity education after his NS. “Usually I’ll just work lah, unless got something urgent,” the 49-year-old said. FINE MARGINS, COSTLY CHALLENGES The bosses of these container truck drivers face a different set of challenges that may inadvertently contribute to those faced by Mr Yusof. Ms Lim Mei Ling, director of Waterfront Services, the company that Mr Yusof works for, told Channel NewsAsia that her small, family-owned business owns eight prime movers and more than 80 trailers and these in themselves pose a challenge: How do you maximise the use of the hardware and, if not in use, park them legally without incurring fines from authorities? “We need to turn around (our jobs) quickly,” Ms Lim explained, “Or else it would mean needing to pay for parking spaces.” Under the Land Transport Authority’s rules, each owner of a heavy vehicle would be required to hold a Vehicle Parking Certificate as proof that his vehicle has a designated space for overnight parking. This costs about S$160 a month, and excludes the cost of the parking lot, she said. And there are not enough of the cheaper lots operated by the Urban Redevlopment Authority (URA) and Housing and Development Board (HDB) to meet demand and she could be on the waiting list for months and even years. Many container trucking companies, particularly the smaller ones, turn to private operators who either tend to charge more or could terminate the agreement at short notice. Another reason why drivers would need to work above and beyond the stipulated working hours is the size of the container ships that visit Singapore: They have gotten bigger. So even if they make port calls less frequently, the number of containers they bring in each time has increased - making the peaks and troughs for these container trucking companies that much more pronounced, Mr Sebastian Shen, co-founder of start-up Haulio, explained. This leads to a more pressing problem: The manpower to drive the trucks. “We can buy more prime movers, but who will drive them?” Mr Hew pointed out. As it is, Ms Lim said she only just got the full complement of eight drivers for her fleet, and even then she has to constantly fret over their availability. To encourage her drivers to turn up each day, the Waterfront director has turned to giving allowances when they start work early (before 7am) or when they work late (after 11pm), as well as dangle incentives so they do not take leave. On average, she said her drivers receive between S$3,000 and S$6,000 monthly depending on how much they work. Mr Yusof said his average monthly take-home pay is about S$3,500 but it depends on his workload. Ms Lim said the situation with these drivers are such that they may decide to stop driving or change employers at the drop of the hat, without advance warning. “Here, your notice period is when the driver hands in his keys,” she said. There are also drivers who may decide that they have earned enough for a certain period of time, and just stop turning up for work. This is the reason why the industry pays drivers on a per trip basis, she explained. Meanwhile, the talent pool is shrinking with no new blood coming in to replace the aging drivers. Mr Hew said that for his company, even after placing advertisements in the Jobs Bank, the only applicants are those already in the industry and are in their 50s, if not older. Both companies have been relying heavily on their foreign workers to sustain the business. They make up at least half of the driver pool and they tend to be called on at times when the local drivers may not be available (such as public holidays or weekends) or are physically less suited to the task (such as when moving heavy loads that require much manoeuvring), both Ms Lim and Mr Hew said. PRIMED FOR DISRUPTION? Given the challenges faced by the drivers and trucking companies, it appears the industry is primed for a tech disruption. And this is where Haulio, a start-up incubated by PSA International's corporate venture capital arm PSA unBoxed, hopes to reap the rewards. Mr Shen said there are about 230 haulage companies in Singapore, and of these, about half - mostly the smaller players - have signed up to its platform. Essentially, it hopes to shake up the industry like ride-hailing firms Uber and Grab did for the taxi industry here. With its self-developed algorithm, Haulio looks to match available prime movers to existing jobs posted on its platform with prices set by the companies themselves. It then takes a 3 to 5 per cent cut from a successful match. Haulio’s Shen said while the Government has championed the need for digitalisation and the move to Industry 4.0, the haulage industry appears to be stuck in 2.0. He shared how he has met business owners who are stuck in the old ways of doing business through “phones and fax machines”. Then there are those like Waterfront’s Ms Lim who choose to “take each day as it comes”. The daily challenges are already “so big” to deal with, she said, leaving her with no chance to see how technology could alleviate some of her pain points. On his end, Mr Shen hopes to create a platform that would have buy-in from drivers, business owners and the wider logistics ecosystem, or as he puts it: “One with an overarching trust.” Mr Hew, though, was more sceptical of Haulio’s proposition. Unlike the taxi industry, when a Grab or Uber could easily dispatch the nearest available car or taxi to a commuter who requested a ride, the haulage business is different in that a prime mover driver cannot just pick up a job along the way to another assignment without negative consequences. “If my driver goes to pick up a job and gets stuck (in a jam) at the container yard picking up the container, then I’d have failed to deliver on my original job to an existing client,” the managing director explained.  But what about driverless trucks announced by the Ministry of Transport and port operator PSA in January last year to alleviate manpower and traffic congestion challenges?  Mr Hew and Mr Yusof said they have seen these driverless trucks deployed within PSA's ports, but they are confined to specific and clearly demarcated spaces and might not work well outside the port. It is \"very difficult\" for these trucks to operate outside the port due to the uncertain traffic conditions as well as fluid situations at the container yards, Mr Hew said.  As a first step, he suggested PSA be more transparent with the data they already have like vessel arrival and departure times or types of containers on board a vessel. These, he said, are available at a cost to companies but he reckoned it should be made freely available to create more efficiencies. Mr Peter Ho, president of the Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore) or CDAS, told Channel NewsAsia that his association had asked PSA to release the information since it had explored the idea of a Container Management System (CMS) in 2012 and that was subsequently launched in 2014. The information would theoretically close the loop between the ports, the container yards and the trucking companies, but Mr Ho acknowledged that there are differing agendas in the industry though they may want to fix the same problems.  \"Like that, how to collaborate?\"  When asked to comment on the industry's efforts to improve processes, a PSA corporate spokesperson said Haulio is in line with the organisation's vision for the container port of the future, which looks at increased connectivity with the logistics and supply chain industry.  Mr Ho did point out that job-pooling and asset-sharing are \"great concepts\" and CDAS is looking to make this a reality. It told its members, which number more than 70, in June that it's looking to use its existing technologies like CMS, electronic container trucking system (e-CTS) and Transport Integration Platform-Transport Management System (TRIP-TMS) to offer such a service. The president said unlike profit-driven entities like Haulio or PSA, however, the association would offer this as a value-added service and intends to charge a flat administrative fee if and when such a job-pooling service is rolled out. \"It's ultimately up to the industry to decide, like it did in the ride-hailing sector with Grab and Uber, which solution it wants to adopt,\" he said.  Mr Ho added that beyond the business proposition and technology advances, the most important hurdle to cross is mindsets. \"There are many hurdles in terms of mindset shift: From being competitors to collaborators, sharing of competitive knowledge (such as) customer base, providing visibility to another's available assets, etc,\" he said. \"These need to be addressed and resolved before job-pooling or asset-sharing can be effective.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/container-trucking-business-change-painful-roadblocks-10647702"}, {"datetime": "27 Aug 2018 10:41PM", "tags": ["Eddie Teo", "Council of Presidential Advisers", "Halimah Yacob"], "author": "", "title": "Former PSC chairman Eddie Teo appointed member of Council of Presidential Advisers", "content": " SINGAPORE: A month after veteran civil servant Eddie Teo retired as chairman of the Public Service Commission (PSC), he has been appointed as a member of the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA).  The council provides advice to President Halimah Yacob before she exercises her discretionary powers on fiscal matters related to Singapore’s past reserves and the appointment of key public office holders.

Every year, about 10,000 tonnes of okara are produced, of which about 80 per cent are generally discarded as food waste due to its unpleasant taste and smell. To reduce this waste, NUS scientists spent one year tweaking a recipe that experimented with 10 different yeasts and four different enzymes before coming up with their ideal recipe. \"Okara has an unpleasant smell and taste - it smells fishy, tastes bland, and has a gritty mouthfeel.

This was announced by Professor Subra Suresh, President of NTU, as part of the university's five-year plan to advance as a leading global university through a number of what Prof Suresh called \"moonshot\" projects. The new 40,000 gross sq m academic building will cost S$180 million and is expected to be completed in 2021. Designed by RSP Architects Planners & Engineers, one of the firms behind Changi Airport Terminal 4, the six-storey building will house the Nanyang Business School as well as activities of several other colleges and schools, the university said in a press release. The building will be constructed using mass-engineered timber, with material procured from renewable forests and pre-fabricated before being installed on site. This will be more environmentally friendly and require less manpower than traditional construction methods, according to NTU. \"Bringing together our approaches to innovation and sustainability, the new academic building will be the largest wooden building in Asia, and it will exemplify our distinctive NTU Smart Campus and show that we 'walk the talk' of our commitment to sustainability,\" said Prof Suresh. NTU also has a sports hall, The Wave, which was built using mass-engineered timber and completed last year. The university will also double the solar energy harnessed to power it to 9.9 megawatts by 2019, said Prof Suresh. This will supply between 7 and 10 per cent of the university's electricity needs. ATTRACTING TALENT Speaking at a university town hall meeting, Prof Suresh announced specific targets focusing on attracting top faculty and students, developing new academic and research programmes and enhancing campus-wide community engagement. NTU will aim to recruit about 300 faculty members over the next five years, and will support 350 new two-year \"post-doc\" positions to attract researchers starting this year. The university will also renew its commitment to support the recruitment of top undergraduates through scholarships and bursaries. \"No deserving Singaporean student will be denied a world-class education at NTU because of financial or other impediments,\" Prof Suresh said.

The fact that protectionism is becoming more apparent globally, at a time when the world economy looks vulnerable, was a point highlighted on the first day of the two-day FutureChina Global Forum and Singapore Regional Business Forum in Singapore on Monday (Aug 27). Speakers including Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox extolled the merits of the multilateral trading system, and urged countries to keep trade open and free. \"The multilateral trading system has catalysed economic development, uplifted countries and regions, and narrowed economic disparities. This has also reduced the potential for conflict and promoted peace,” said Mr Teo. “We need to continue to strengthen this multilateral system and ensure that trade remains free and fair.” Mr Fox said prosperity from free trade underpins the social cohesion that is crucial for political stability. While he voiced some familiar charges of unfair play by China, he cautioned that it would be unwise to upend the current rules-based multilateral trading system - clearly making a reference to US President Donald Trump’s threat to leave the World Trade Organisation. \"We’ve developed an interdependence in a way that hasn’t existed in history. We need better global behaviour ... I can understand why Western countries are impatient about Chinese behaviour,” said Mr Fox. “The alternative to rules-based system is a deal-based system between the world’s most powerful, and that would leave many countries behind.” Meanwhile, other panellists warned against viewing trade as a zero-sum game, and analysed how ASEAN - caught in between two giants - should react. “I don’t think the development of China or some (other) big country will form any crowding out effect to other countries,” said Qiu Zhikun, General Manager and Country Head, Bank of China Singapore branch. Selena Ling, OCBC Bank's chief economist, felt it would be difficult for ASEAN to pick sides, and that if it were to do so, it would be in a “precarious position”. “The strategy should be to cooperate and compete,” she added. In all, about 800 participants attended Day 1 of the Forum. While it was clear that what was weighing on the minds of business leaders are global uncertainties brought on by the trade tensions, participants and speakers also touched on other topics, including tech and innovation, China’s Belt and Road projects, and ASEAN-China connectivity.

Audrey Tay May Li, the 45-year-old daughter of the founders of The Hour Glass, admitted to three drug charges and one charge of driving without due care or attention. Five other charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. She had earlier claimed trial, but pleaded guilty on Monday afternoon after discussions in chambers with the judge, prosecutors and Tay's defence counsel Eugene Thuraisingam. The traffic accident occurred at Newton Road in the wee hours of Aug 28, 2015. The night before, Tay had gone to a Thai restaurant at Orchard Towers, where a transsexual named Jeri offered her \"something to relax\" in the female toilet, court documents said. Tay then used a straw that Jeri offered her to snort powder that Jeri had laid on the toilet seat cover. Tay was aware that the powder was \"K\" or ketamine, which is a Class A controlled drug, investigations revealed. She left Orchard Towers after this and drove to meet a friend. While driving along a three-lane road, her car mounted a kerb, colliding into the central divider of Newton Road, and crashing into a traffic light. The impact of the crash caused the entire traffic light pole to topple, obstructing all three lanes of the road on the opposite side, and also uprooted the central divider. The total cost of repairing both fixtures was about S$3,000, according to the Land Transport Authority. Tay injured her wrist, and admitted to the police officer at the scene that she had consumed ketamine and a glass of wine before driving. She was arrested and an analysis of her blood sample showed that there was about 0.5 micrograms of ketamine per millilitre of blood. Ketamine was also found in her urine sample. SHE TURNED UP INTOXICATED AT IMH, ARRESTED BY CNB While on bail for these offences, Tay agreed to undergo a psychiatric assessment at the expense of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on Oct 10, 2017. However, she went to IMH in an intoxicated state on the day of her appointment. As her urine tested positive for ketamine and benzodiazepines, her psychiatrist reported this to the CNB. She was arrested by CNB officers outside IMH and taken back to CNB headquarters for investigations, where she was searched. Several items were seized from her, including a black pouch with a powdery substance, stained straws and packets of powdery substances which were found to be ketamine. Her urine samples were found to contain norketamine, a metabolite of ketamine, which meant she had consumed ketamine. Tay admitted that she had relapsed into consuming drugs two months before and took them twice a week. She admitted to consuming ketamine on Oct 9, 2017, in the toilet of a petrol kiosk along Bukit Timah road by herself, when her chauffeur had stopped to refuel petrol. On Monday, Tay listened to the charges, stopping to clarify with her defence counsel at some points. When District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan addressed her, Tay said: \"I'm on medication, judge.\" The judge then asked her to listen to what he had to say first, and she said she admitted to all the charges \"absolutely, with great remorse\". The case was adjourned to October for mitigation and sentencing. She can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to S$20,000 for consuming ketamine, while her driving offence could cost her a maximum S$1,000 fine and up to six months' jail.

The minister was speaking as part of a panel on innovation and enterprise in the age of disruption at the FutureChina Global Forum. When asked whether Singapore could be a place where the next \"high-tech giant\" could emerge and what it would take for this to happen, Mr Ong spoke about the importance of regulation. \"In the era where we try to attract foreign direct investment and multi-national corporations, cost was an issue, industrial harmony was an issue, and these are all competitive advantage(s),\" said Mr Ong. \"I think (in) the next phase, how we regulate becomes an important competitive advantage.\" Mr Ong added that people must recognise Singapore is \"quite different\" from other markets around the world.  In many markets, start-ups took off due to a lack of regulation, the minister noted. This lack of regulation meant \"you can do almost anything\", and these start-ups also occupy a \"very dominant position\" in the market, he said. Singapore, as a small market in an urban environment, is not able to do that, Mr Ong explained, adding that the country must reconcile different trade-offs. \"Singapore can never be that kind of market because we are (an) urban city, everything in Singapore is well-regulated,\" said Mr Ong.\"Instead, for us, we must become and urban test-bed; well-regulated but able to harmonise and reconciliate different trade-offs.\" Taking the ride-sharing industry as an example, the minister said Singapore faced the same issues other markets have experienced, but cited regulation by the Land Transport Authority as an example of such \"trade-offs\". “So you look at shared rides, for example, when they come to Singapore, it is allowed but the same issues that many other cities face, we face as well,” he said. “There are existing taxi drivers who are concerned, there are standards of service delivery, there are concerns - so the Land Transport Authority put in the right amount of regulation.” This balanced solution creates an environment where the best solutions can test-bed in Singapore, which will be a strong competitive advantage, he said, adding that this has become a model for other countries to look at. Mr Ong was joined on the panel by start-up founders including NinjaVan CEO Lai Chang Wen, Momentum Works’ CEO Li Jianggan, Tay Choon Chong, managing partner of venture capitalist Vertex Ventures China and Tan Kiat How, CEO of Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority.

Faced with the prospect of the company's insolvency, shareholders reluctantly backed a debt-for-equity swap that will leave them with ownership of just 20 per cent of the business, while handing majority control to a group of creditors comprised mainly of hedge funds. \"It's obviously a relief to get this out of the way today and to get such a strong support from our shareholders,\" Noble chairman Paul Brough told reporters after the company won approval from 99.6 per cent of shareholders voting at Monday's 90-minute meeting in Singapore. \"It's all about the business now, rather than the restructuring,\" Mr Brough said after fielding numerous questions about the restructured firm's prospects from the shareholders that packed the banquet hall where the meeting was held. Several small shareholders attending the meeting told Reuters they were angry with Noble's management as the plan diluted the value of their investments, but said they saw no choice but to support the plan in order to save at least some of their money. \"We want to keep the company afloat rather than liquidate it,\" said Mr Roger Ong, 49, a driver who invested in Noble shares. Noble, founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who took advantage of a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world's biggest traders, has had its market value all but wiped out from US$6 billion in February 2015. The crisis for the company started that month after Arnaud Vagner, a former employee, published reports anonymously under the name of Iceberg Research that accused Noble of inflating its assets. The upheaval triggered a share price collapse, credit downgrades, writedowns and asset sales. Singapore-listed Noble has always stood by its accounts. TRADE FINANCING LIFELINE Under the debt-for-equity deal, the company's debt will be halved and it will get access to US$800 million in trade finance and hedging facilities, a lifeline in a sector where profit margins are in the low single digits. In return, Noble will hand over 70 per cent of its restructured business to creditors, while existing shareholders' equity will be reduced to 20 per cent and its management will get 10 per cent. The company's shareholders include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, Abu Dhabi-based fund Goldilocks Investment and Eastspring Investments, as well as more than 30,000 retail investors. Mr Brough, a restructuring expert with more than 30 years of experience including the liquidation of Lehman Brothers' assets in Asia, said Noble would appoint a new chairman and board before the restructured company starts operations in two to three months. Noble seeks to transform itself into an Asian-centric trader mainly dealing with coal, freight and liquefied natural gas. As part of its restructuring plan, the company has already moved its headquarters to London from Hong Kong. Trading in Noble's shares was earlier halted pending an announcement. In its glory days, Noble employed hundreds of traders, with ambitions to rival competitors such as Glencore but it had to sell off prized assets, including its oil and gas units, to rivals Vitol and Mercuria. Noble booked a US$4.9 billion loss in 2017, despite a broad commodity market recovery, and then defaulted on its debt in March 2018. Analysts say Noble still faces an uphill battle, with its losses widening to US$128 million during the April to June quarter from US$72 million in the first quarter. \"There's no evidence so far that the business is turning around,\" said Mr Neel Gopalakrishnan, credit strategist at DBS Group. \"Funding is the most important driver for this business and if a turnaround doesn't come, the company may find it difficult to retain funding lines.\" Iceberg said that Monday's vote would not stop securities holders from suing the individuals and organisations responsible for Noble's downturn.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/noble-group-shareholders-approve-us-3-5b-debt-restructuring-10656782"}, {"datetime": "27 Aug 2018 04:02PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Team Singapore"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: Singapore female bowlers rue missing out on stepladder finals", "content": " PALEMBANG, Indonesia: Singapore bowler Joey Yeo was one strike away from qualifying for the stepladder finals on Monday morning (Aug 27).  Knowing full well she needed to make the chance count, the 20-year-old took a breath, stepped up and threw her ball unto the lane. Alas, it was not meant to be.  Due to what she called an \"adjustment error\", Yeo struck down only six pins. She held her composure to knock down the remaining four pins and, as soon as she did, the tears fell.  She had missed out on qualifying for the women master's stepladder final - and a confirmed medal - by just 10 pinfalls. Her score of 3,837 ranked her fourth behind South Korea's Lee Yeonji's 3,847.  Her national team-mate Daphne Tan finished fifth with 3,808 pinfalls.  “I tried to make it the best shot of my life. I knew it was make or break; I did my very best,\" said Yeo, her voice shaking as she spoke to reporters minutes after her game ended.  \"I executed the shot properly but unfortunately I needed to make an adjustment which I didn't see beforehand; because bowling is like that. The movement is so quick; if you're not on top of your game you don't have that much leeway for mistakes, and I didn't capitalise on that (chance).\" Yeo was understandably disappointed. She had started the day third overall after scoring 1,941 pinfalls in the first block on Sunday afternoon. Tan was fourth with 1,939.  But a slow start on Monday morning proved costly for the Singapore pair. After some sub-200 scores from both Yeo and Tan, the gap between them and their South Korean and Japanese opponents gradually grew bigger.  They attempted to mount a comeback, but by then it was too late.  \"They were a little bit tense at the start,\" said national coach Jason Yeong-Nathan.  \"I'm sure they wanted to do well but ... I'm very proud of these two (Yeo and Tan). They are among the youngest, and are usually (our) third or fourth bowler.

LTA called the tender last August to develop bus services based on commuters' demand via a mobile application in real time.

The second phase involves the development of hardware and software solutions for the ODPB system. These solutions comprise mobile apps for commuters and bus captains, back-end tools required to monitor services during the trial, as well as operational and maintenance support for the system. “Both contractors will train bus captains and support staff to operate the system.

Koh Seng Thiam, 50, pleaded guilty to one charge of dishonestly misappropriating the money between September 2014 and April 2015. His acts were exposed by his brother, who alleged that Koh stole various sums of money entrusted to him. It began with the death of Koh's father on Sep 1, 2014. Koh's mother, 78, entrusted a POSB account to Koh to pay for the funeral. The account was registered under her name and her daughter's name. She handed to Koh the ATM card and personal identification number (PIN) to the account, which had about S$23,000. However, by the time Koh returned the ATM card in May 2015, he had withdrawn a total of S$14,000 for gambling and investing in a business, instead of using the money to settle the funeral expenses. Koh also withdrew a large sum of money from an OCBC account that his parents had opened jointly in 2013. The principal sum in the time deposit account was S$100,000, and it was to mature in November 2014. After Koh's father died, he removed his father's name from the account and inserted his own name as a joint account-holder. He was to use this sum to take care of his mother's needs. However, when the time deposit matured on Nov 8, 2014, Koh withdrew the S$100,000 and spent it on gambling and investing in a business, court documents said. Koh's parents had another time deposit account, this time with UOB, that was opened in November 2013. The first principal sum placed in the account was S$100,000, while a second sum of S$80,000 was put in not long after. Both sums were to mature in December 2014. On Dec 8, 2014, the first principal sum of S$100,000 matured and the sum was withdrawn. Of this money, Koh's mother entrusted him with about S$82,000 to buy an HDB flat for her. However, he did not do so and instead spent the money on gambling and investing in a business. When the second sum of S$80,000 matured and was withdrawn, Koh's mother similarly entrusted the money to Koh for the purposes of taking care of her needs. He spent it in the same fashion - on gambling and investing in a business. No restitution was made as of Aug 10 this year, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tow Chew Chi said.

The restaurant will serve its last dinner on Oct 31. “Mod-Sin” - short for “Modern Singaporean\" - was a style first coined by Low when he opened Wild Rocket back in 2005, with the aim of showcasing Singaporean dishes delivered with a twist. Over the years, dishes like Low’s laksa pesto pasta, duck liver-filled ravioli in duck and salted vegetable soup, and scallop sashimi with chye poh (preserved radish) – a dish inspired by our local chwee kueh – have become popular Wild Rocket menu stalwarts. The 46-year-old lawyer-turned-chef cited various reasons for the closure. First, Hangout Hotel - where Wild Rocket is located - will undergo major refurbishments over an extended period of time next year. There is also some uncertainty regarding the lease of arts commune Emily Hill, where the open-air parking space also serves as the restaurant’s car park. Low told CNA Lifestyle that he decided to take this opportunity to close so he could take a break. “Thirteen years is a long time and a break is due,” he shared. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while as I wanted to do something different and bring Mod-Sin overseas. “Though now with three new projects, it’s maybe not too much of a break!” he continued with a laugh. His overseas ventures will see him opening Roketto, which he called “the baby sister of Wild Rocket”, this December in Hokkaido. The casual dining restaurant, located at ski resort The Maples Niseko, will serve up Southeast Asian flavours with Japanese ingredients. Bak kut teh ramen, laksa somen with snow crab, braised pork rice bowls and bite-sized roti prata topped with chopped tuna are some of the items that will feature on the menu.   In the evenings, the restaurant will transform into a cocktail bar - a collaboration between Low, High Five Tokyo, Bar Mood Taipei and Nutmeg & Clove Singapore. Also opening at the end of the year is Low’s Southeast Asian noodle concept bar in Hualien, Taiwan. The restaurant will feature local favourite Roxy laksa as one of its dishes. Back in Singapore, Low will open his second branch of Relish - his all-day burger and pasta restaurant - at Frasers Tower on Cecil Street come November. He first opened Relish at Cluny Court back in 2006. “I’m still thinking of giving it a little twist, perhaps a bit of Wild Rocket somewhere,” he teased. Low also told CNA Lifestyle that there’s a possibility of reopening Wild Rocket here in Singapore. “But not in the foreseeable future,” he admitted. “There’s also a possibility of opening Wild Rocket overseas,” he said. “If we find the right partners.\" From now until Oct 31, Wild Rocket will serve three dinner menus - five-course, seven-course and nine-course - with a mixture of old and current items to celebrate its 13 years.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/wild-rocket-closing-modern-singapore-cuisine-chef-heads-overseas-10655508"}, {"datetime": "26 Aug 2018 11:13PM", "tags": ["travel", "holiday", "bar"], "author": "", "title": "Atlas Bar, COO Boutique Hostel on TIME's World's Greatest Places 2018 list", "content": " SINGAPORE: Two Singapore establishments have been featured in TIME Magazine's first annual World's Greatest Places list.

Lien clinched the silver medal after losing to South Korea's Sung Jira 2-4 in the women's under 62kg final at the Jakarta Convention Centre on Saturday (Aug 25). Speaking to Channel NewsAsia on Sunday, Lien said: \"I'm very proud. I hope this will boost the reputation of the sport in Singapore.\"  The Temasek Polytechnic student, a blue belt holder, also hopes that her success will change people's attitudes towards jujitsu. \"Many jujitsu exponents have to balance training with studies, and some schools need to be more flexible in allowing these athletes time to train and compete,\" said Lien.  \"I felt that some of the (national) swimmers had it easier to get time off to compete or train, but I struggled to get permission to do the same. Hopefully with this medal, that could change.\"  She is into her final semester at Temasek Polytechnic, where she is pursuing a diploma in Early Development Childhood and Education. Upon completing it in 2019, Lien aims to take a year off her academic pursuits to focus on her dream of becoming a world champion. She would have been encouraged by how she held her own against Sung, the world champion in the under 62kg category. Her South Korean opponent, who holds a purple belt, is also one level above her. \"This competition has taught me that it's important to not limit my abilities because of my belt,\" she said.  En route to the final, the 19-year-old beat Turkmenistan's Krovyakova Violetta 6-0 in the semis. She also defeated Mongolia's Battsogt Buyandelger, Thailand's Sangsirichok Onanong and Indonesia's Julia Simone all by submission in the round of 32, round of 16 and the quarter-finals respectively. This is the first time that jujitsu is being contested at the Asian Games.

The flats are within the first two housing projects for Punggol Point District and are expected to be completed in 2023. Punggol Point Cove will comprise five blocks with 1,172 units while Punggol Point Woods will have six blocks with 940 units. Punggol Point Cove is located along the eastern shoreline of Punggol Point District, HDB said, and its blocks are designed to \"step down towards the promenade, so as to maximise the views towards the sea\". Meanwhile, Punggol Point Woods is located next to the Heritage Trail, a 1.5km pathway - including a section of Old Punggol Road - that connects the My Waterway@Punggol pedestrian bridge to Punggol Jetty. \"Punggol Point is set to offer a tranquil living environment with a touch of nostalgia for its residents,\" HDB said.  It is one of seven waterfront districts planned for Punggol, and is envisioned to be a \"Green Heritage\" district that embraces nature and pays tribute to Punggol's history, HDB added. Plans for Punggol Point District will be exhibited at the HDB Hub sales atrium from Aug 28 and members of the public are invited to share their thoughts on what they would like to see along the Heritage Trail. The Heritage Trail is a nod to the history of Punggol, which was known in the early 1900s for its poultry, pig-rearing, fishing, fresh produce farms and rubber plantations. The Old Punggol Road was the main route for many farmers, fishermen and traders who lived along the coastal district from Punggol to Serangoon to transport their harvest. The route will be preserved through a 10m green buffer zone on both sides of the carriageway and an old bus stop will be retained to serve as a rest stop. The other waterfront districts in Punggol are Waterway East, Waterway West, Northshore, Matilda, Canal and Crescent.

This year, the overarching theme of the event, held at Suntec International Convention and Exhibition Centre from Aug 25 to 26, was “passion and joy”, it debuted a good number of high-octane performance models to the public. The big surprise of the show was the appearance of the brand-new Z4 Roadster, a car that had just enjoyed its global unveil several hours before the opening of BMW World Singapore at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Monterey, California.  Joining the Z4 was the Singapore reveal of the carmaker’s flagship two-door sports car, the 8 Series, plus the white-knuckle M2 Competition and frugal-yet-rapid hybrid i8 Roadster. Also in attendance was the BMW Group’s other brand Mini (the Bavarian automaker has owned it since 2000). Virtually its entire range was there, including the Clubman station wagon and Countryman compact SUV, along with a classic Mini decorated with fashion icon Sir Paul Smith’s signature stripes. If you didn't have the chance to partake in the festivities, never fear: We’ve put together the five most significant cars exhibited at BMW World that caught our eyes. BMW i8 ROADSTER To say that the i8 Coupe caused a bit of a stir back in 2014 would be a bit of an understatement. Here was a car that looked a good decade ahead of its time, riding on a carbon fibre and aluminium chassis, and was usually the sole purview of million-dollar supercars and with a petrol-electric plug-in hybrid drivetrain delivering pace without the associated environmental guilt. Oh, and those dramatic beetle-wing doors, too. But now that we’re all (somewhat) used to seeing a sports car from 2028 zipping around the roads, BMW has seen fit to release a companion to the i8 Coupe, the i8 Roadster. As its name implies, the main differentiators are a fabric soft top, “double-bubble” rear deck, and a matte grey plaque on the B-pillars bearing the “Roadster” designation. You’ll be pleased to know the i8 Coupe’s beetle-wing doors are carried over onto the Roadster. As with the i8 Coupe, the i8 Roadster retains the electric motor/1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine of its hard-top counterpart, but with a slightly greater capacity for its lithium-ion battery pack. This allows the i8 Roadster to run purely on electron power for a claimed 53km at speeds of up to 120km/h. In addition to that, the i8 Roadster also brings to the table some new colours, with the car exhibited at BMW World Singapore 2018 clad in E-Copper metallic. Orange to you and us, but to BMW, it’s high-tech orange. Or, well, E-Copper. BMW CONCEPT X7 iPERFORMANCE Let’s leave aside for a moment what a massive coup getting a concept car flown over for BMW World Singapore is. Such cars are usually one-offs, made specially for motor shows (this one was first exhibited at last year’s Frankfurt Motor Show), so we can only imagine how much it’s insured for. Anyway. The X7 may still be a concept for now, but it’s only a matter of time before it reaches production. The X7 is a clear signal of intent from BMW it wants to compete in the upper-upper echelons of the luxury SUV segment, taking the fight to the Range Rover Vogue and Porsche Cayenne Turbo. Hitherto the X7, the largest and most luxurious SUV BMW had in the range is the X5, which technically occupies the same space in the model hierarchy as the 5 Series. It’s difficult to extrapolate what the production X7 will be like, but given it’s meant to be the 7 Series in BMW’s X lineup of SUVs, expect luxury – and lots of it. That is to say, plenty of leather, premium wood trim and metal surfaces. The X7 also represents a break from BMW tradition in that it has an exceptionally upright profile with a huge glasshouse area (the glazed surface area above the car’s shoulderline), making it more “utility” than it is “sport”. A brave new BMW for a brave new world, indeed. BMW M5 (E39) To simply judge the third-generation BMW M5 (with the internal codename of E39) on its looks alone would be doing it a grave disservice. It does, after all, look no more threatening than a regular 5 Series, though the more eagle-eyed will note the more butch styling, such as a small animal-swallowing front air dam, racy deep-dish wheels and quad tailpipes. Truth be told, you wouldn’t know what you were looking at – unless you knew what you were looking at. And that’s the crux of the M5’s appeal, because lurking underneath that seemingly innocuous skin is a 5-litre V8 that develops a thumping 400hp. Admittedly, 400hp is middling today, given that the recently launched M5 (the sixth-generation car) develops 600hp, but bear in mind this particular M5 turns 20 this year. It’s also helpful to note the E39-generation M5 had had comparable performance to a Ferrari of its day, which gives you some idea how insane it must have been in 1998. Even more than its performance figures, though, is how the third-generation M5 is viewed today – as one of the greatest driver-focused sports saloons of the modern era. Owing to the vagaries of the COE system and a hefty annual road tax bill, fewer than a handful of E39 M5s remain in Singapore. BMW M3 CSL (E46) If there were three letters that could send BMW fans into a tizzy, it would be “CSL”. First used on limited-run “Batmobile” 3.0 CSL in the early 1970s, BMW revived the hallowed CSL badge again some three decades later and slapped it on the M3. An acronym that stands for Coupe Sport Leichtbau, German for Coupe Sport Lightweight, CSLs are what happens when automakers take the concept of “less is more” very seriously. And then charge for the privilege. The original 3.0 CSL deleted the interior trim, soundproofing and replaced the glass windows with plastic. The M3 CSL aped its legendary ancestor by axing most of the soundproofing, along with the electrically adjustable seats (replaced by fixed-back carbon fibre bucket seats) and the satellite navigation. If you were feeling particularly masochistic, you could also tell BMW to leave out the air-conditioning and stereo, saving you the maximum 110kg over regular M3s. Happily enough, BMW gave the M3 CSL a smidge more power (17hp to be precise) over standard M3s, for a grand total of 360hp. As with the E39 M5, the M3 CSL is an incredibly rare sight on Singapore roads, again with fewer than a handful around. That’s not so much down to our vehicle ownership system, but more because BMW only made 1,383 of them back in 2004. THE NEW BMW 8 SERIES If looks could kill, the BMW 8 Series would do it. All long of nose and low-slung of silhouette, with an aggressive overbite known in automotive design circles as a “shark nose”, it’s clear the all-new 8 Series means business. If its badge sounds familiar, it should. It revives a nameplate last seen in 1999, and while it may be marginally smaller than its predecessor, it stays true in spirit, at least. Pitched as BMW’s top-of-the-line, two-door sports car, the 8 Series was, and is, a grand tourer of the highest order. Made to have equal amounts of speed, comfort and mile-gobbling ability, the 8 Series exhibited at BMW World Singapore was a pre-production example, with it set to go on sale in the months to come. However, what we know about it so far, we really like. A chassis comprised of exotic materials like carbon fibre, aluminium and magnesium helps keep the weight down while maintaining rigidity. The new 8 Series also plays host to other small, but clever ergonomics touches. BMW says the low seating position in the rear seats negate the need for headrests, which is handy because cars of its ilk tend to have fairly small rear windows, and headrests can eat into what is already spare rearward visibility. Test drives can be booked at the Performance Motors or Performance Munich Autos showrooms.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/bmw-world-i8-roadster-z4-first-edition-concept-x7-iperformance-10652892"}, {"datetime": "26 Aug 2018 06:21AM", "tags": ["Ong Ye Kung", "PSLE", "education", "politics"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Political power, education and walking the talk: Education Minister Ong Ye Kung goes On the Record", "content": " SINGAPORE: My conversation with Education Minister Ong Ye Kung begins with him describing the lowest point of his political career. Mr Ong has risen swiftly through the ranks since he, as part of a People’s Action Party (PAP) team, won in the Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in the 2015 general election. As we sit down to discuss issues recently brought up in the Prime Minister’s National Day Rally speech and the ups and downs of his own political journey, my first question to him is to describe the highest and lowest points of his career so far. He chooses to start at the bottom, as if wanting to get it out of the way quickly. “Let's start with lows since I lost my first election. I don’t brood over it. But it was tough.” He is referring to being part of the team that lost in 2011 to the opposition Workers’ Party (WP) team in Aljunied GRC. That was the first time an opposition party defeated the PAP in a GRC. “It opened my eyes to how tough it can be. The national mood wasn’t so good and we faced a very strong WP team led by Low Thia Khiang. His jumping over (to join the GRC team), I think, made a big difference. But we fought the best fight we could.” To listen to the full interview, click here. He refers to it as a “baptism by fire” and says that going into the election, he didn’t expect it to be so tough. I wonder why he failed to sense the national mood. “I was a rookie and just wasn’t mature enough as a politician. With many things in life, you have to go through it, experience it, and then you grow up. The important thing is with a setback like that, you have to bounce back, learn from it.” Indeed, he learnt a “tremendous lesson”. “The reality of politics, how important it is to sense the mood, move the masses, be able to put yourself forward as a credible person who would help residents change their lives. Another key lesson is an internal one - when you face a setback like that, how do you pick yourself up and soldier on?” After the defeat, he stayed in his job as Deputy Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress for about a year before leaving for the private sector to become director of group strategy at Keppel Corporation.  Prior to this, he had been a high-flying civil servant who started off at the Ministry of Communications in 1993, before moving over to the Ministry of Trade and Industry in 2000 where he was the deputy chief negotiator for the Singapore-US Free Trade Agreement. He was also principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong from 2003 to 2005 and has also served as Mr Lee's press secretary. He has also held the role of chief executive of the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. “Personally, I feel going through all this does make me a better person. You learn not to take yourself so seriously. You take your work seriously, but don’t take yourself too seriously. \"Setbacks do happen, and you just have to deal with it and bounce back ... Other people have much more severe setbacks and yet they bounce back. Those are inspirations.” THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER POLITICAL SETBACK As our conversation continues to more recent developments, it becomes apparent that being ready for more political challenges is not far from his mind. It comes up when I ask him for his views on the long-term healthcare and housing policies announced by the prime minister at the recent National Day Rally. Mr Lee described the schemes as ambitious endeavours that will stretch over 50 years and more, several generations, and many General Elections. I ask Mr Ong if this is a way of securing the PAP’s position ahead of the next election. “It's really not about who is in government, but to have the conviction that in this little red dot, you must have longer-term policies. If you're caught by short-termism and popularism, it's not going to work for Singapore. Already, we are disadvantaged by size, disadvantaged by the lack of natural resources. What we have as an advantage is that as a small place, we can be more united and we can have plans that are long-term in nature, and that way, we are more coherent, our policies are more sound, more sustainable.\" He says he doesn’t think in terms of political power. “Who wins the election and who is the government is for people to decide, but this Government believes in long-term policy. So long as we are in government, this is how we will implement the policies and people know what they will get with us as (the) Government.  \"Ultimately, this is about what policies can best serve Singaporeans for the long term.\" When I put it to him that in spite of this, it’s possible that the PAP may not be in power for the long term, he acknowledges that could happen. “It may happen. Never think any ward is safe. We are a small place ... When the mood swings, the entire island will swing. I believe the day the PAP loses an election and cannot govern is when things are very bad and probably policies go awry. People don’t feel that we're serving them anymore.  \"When that happens, we will probably deserve to lose. And hopefully then, another party can come in and can carry on the long-term policies, and take the long-term perspective for the benefit of Singapore.” “PARACHUTED” INTO POLITICAL OFFICE After the 2015 election, Mr Ong was thrust straight into office when he was appointed Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills).  A year later, he was promoted to full Education Minister (Higher Education and Skills), as well as Second Minister for Defence. Earlier this year, as the Ministry of Education (MOE) reverted to having only one minister, he was appointed to that role. The highest point of his career so far, he says, is very much tied to this ministry. “In my earlier years, in 2015, after I came in, I explained the need for SkillsFuture, multiple pathways and the fact that students have different passions, and we should let them pursue their passions.  \"Then I introduced the early admission exercise for polytechnics, which is based not just on academic grades, but on aptitudes. That was very well-received and that was a very high point for me. It made me believe that whatever you do, you have to explain where you're coming from, what are the principles, what are your basic foundational beliefs, and then I think you have a higher chance of people accepting it.” His rapid rise through the political ranks has not gone unnoticed. In the initial years, some members of the public described him as having been parachuted in and questioned his credibility. This still happens from time-to-time. “I would say, judge me by what I'm delivering and what I'm doing. The path, to me, is not that easy, having to go through 2011 and the Aljunied GRC, then changing jobs and experiencing different sectors. If other people think it’s easy, and if I'm not doing a good job, I deserve the criticism. But I hope I do a good job.” He points out that, in fact, his journey in politics began even before 2011, but he postponed his entry because of considerations for his father, who was one of 13 Barisan Sosialis legislative representatives elected in the 1963 General Election. He later had disagreements with the PAP. “He had no misgivings with the current generation of PAP leaders, not even the 3G, 2G leaders.  \"His misgivings and disagreements were with the first generation PAP leaders and over very deep-seated cultural, language issues ... over the merger with Malaysia. Those were the issues. There were still a few first generation leaders around in 2006, so, I could see he was not comfortable. He said, ‘Why not later? Why not later?’ “Although he blessed it, in the end, I counted myself out. It would not have been respectful to him. He had passed away by 2011, but even before he passed away, he was a lot more at ease with the idea. So, I decided I would enter politics in 2011. “Maybe it was a parachute, but it took me a long time to jump out of the plane,” he adds laughingly. He counts his father as his most powerful political influence. “It’s really a subconscious imbibing of values. I watched him when I was young, what he believes in. In politics, I believe you must have conviction, and a view in a certain direction, because if you don’t, then you're just managing the bureaucracy. I might have gotten that from my father. He has a certain conviction. He stood on principles. If you look at it in terms of the political parties we joined, it’s different, but in terms of wanting to make a difference, I think we were on the same side.” He admits considering other options after his 2011 defeat. “I didn’t know whether I’ll be welcomed back, having lost once, whether I would be happier in the private sector. But having experienced the private sector, the union and public service, by 2015, I felt public service is probably what I enjoy doing the most, what I find most fulfilling. My test is this: When you are on your deathbed and you think back what you have done, I think I would have regretted if I had not come in, so when the PM invited me again, I felt I should give it another try. “If you are not in government, then you have no policy levers. I think this is where you have a platform and an opportunity to make a big difference to many people’s lives.” PSLE AND THE CULTURE OF LABELLING We move on to discussing hot-button issues in education. In Parliament earlier this year, he addressed suggestions by some MPs to abolish the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), or removing the practice of segregating students into different classes based on their academic results. He said then that this may not reflect the preferences of a majority of students and their parents. Bold moves cannot be made recklessly, he cautioned, lest they \"undo what had worked and served students well in the past\". I put it to him that this might have served academically inclined students well, but the negative aspects of the exam cannot be denied. Considering the stress it causes, how it judges students at a very young age, and labels them for so many more years of their lives, are the perceived plus points worth it? “I accept that,\" he said. \"Sometimes the stakes are seen as very high. It really should not be.  \"The key purpose is for the students to feel they have an exam that they can work towards, that allows them to consolidate everything that they've learnt for the last six years in primary school and know what is their level, so that they can go to a school that is more suited to their standard of learning, their pace of learning. That will be a good school to that student and that way he or she has the best chance to go as far he or she can.\" He later admits that changing perceptions about the objectives of the PSLE is something that his ministry needs to continue working on.  “You can't have education without tests and exams, because you have to reflect how much I have learnt. So there's nothing wrong with tests and exams. But I accept your point of view, that it can be stressful, it can be very high stakes. So, I think these are issues worth looking at. \"But don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. We need PSLE as an important feature of the education system.\" The MOE is attempting to mitigate the perceived stakes. As part of a wider shift to move away from an over-emphasis on academic results, the T-score system in the PSLE will be replaced with eight broader \"achievement levels\" in 2021. IS EVERY SCHOOL A GOOD SCHOOL? He reiterates an example he raised in Parliament to make his case for keeping the PSLE intact. “Switzerland doesn’t have any equivalent of PSLE, so you just send students to the school nearest their home, but as a result, there's no choice for students. Students can't say that I worked towards a certain PSLE result. I can look forward to a school that I want to go to. In Switzerland, there's no such choice.” I put it to him that if, as the MOE says, every school is a good school, choice shouldn’t really matter. “Every school being a good school does not mean every school is the same. If every school is the same, every school can't be a good school. So when we talk about this aspiration or this vision, of every school is a good school, it is really to say, it is possible at some point, every kid can go to a school that suits him or her best and help him or her achieve the best that he or she can be ... And that requires every school to be slightly different, to be strong in different areas that play to the strength of the kid. And for that to happen, choice is important.”  NARROWING THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR He also cites other issues that proximity-based school admission raises. \"Just look at other countries where you have rich neighbourhoods with just that one rich school and all rich students go there. Then it will be a cocoon.” I remark that under the current system, we are seeing this to a certain extent in Singapore too. “But we can work against it, because we have the levers in place. We have the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme that we can now make use of once we tweak the mechanisms,\" he said. \"We can now recognise talent for admission into schools. And if there's a singular talent, we can come up with a programme to develop those singular talents for students from poorer backgrounds as in the case of the Junior Sports Academy. So we take in students, including those from poor backgrounds, and train them professionally in sports.” The subject of tuition inevitably comes up as the affluent can afford not just academic tuition, but sports tuition which gives them a leg-up even when it comes to DSA. “The rich will always be able to take advantage of any system. Tuition is not a Government policy,” he says and maintains that the education system is being designed to narrow the differences between the affluent and the masses. “With the right programmes and mechanisms in place, we can do this.” He expects the expansion of MOE kindergartens to make a difference as well. “One-third of the places are set aside for students from poorer backgrounds.” However, I put it to him that if he is concerned that doing away with PSLE and implementing proximity-based admissions would result in greater social stratification, why not ensure a healthier socio-economic mix in neighbourhoods or situate schools better? “You can mix the neighbourhood. Because 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in HDB, we can do some of it, but even so, not all neighbourhoods will be that mixed. But fundamentally, why take away the choice for a primary school student to work towards a secondary school that suits him best, that is strong in different areas that play to the strength of the kid? “Different people have different strengths, and the system must be variegated enough to allow them the choice. First, to guide them to discover their own strength, and where their passion lies, where their interest lies, and then have a multi-path system for everyone to pursue what is best for them.” I wonder how he decided which school was best for him when he was growing up.  In an interview with another publication, he was quoted as saying he wanted to go to Raffles Institution (RI) “because I wanted to do well\". I ask him what made him think that he had to go to RI to do well. “I wanted to follow my brother. He went there, so as a younger brother, you tend to follow your elder brother. For a 12-year-old it was really just based on the fact that kor-kor went there. It was really just as simple as that.“ As it turns out, he went to a Special Assistance Plan institution, Maris Stella High School, as his Chinese-educated father wanted him to. Mr Ong says he is happy with that choice and he “wouldn’t change a thing”. “I think from there, I learnt how to overcome setbacks, I learn how to deal with people, talk to people, get things done. It’s very hard to articulate.” To illustrate that today, every school has its strengths, he points out the “wonderful things” different schools are doing in the form of applied learning programmes, enrichment classes and varied pedagogies. He claims that attitudes on the ground are changing. “As an MP, I visit a lot of homes. I do feel on the ground PSLE is still a stressful exam, but I think on the ground, more and more parents and students are taking a lighter attitude towards it, that this is not the be-all and end-all. If you want to apply to polytechnic or university, increasingly, they don’t just look at your academic results anyway. They look at your aptitude. “But more importantly is the job market. I think employers are also shifting and not just purely looking at academics. They are looking at your competencies and what you can do. The environment of moving towards advanced technology, high-tech innovative sectors is also making people feel that academics are not everything. In fact, getting your first qualification is a start of a lifelong journey and the deeper the sense of lifelong learning sinks in, the more we feel that PSLE is just really one small milestone.” IS THE GOVERNMENT WALKING THE TALK? While private-sector employers might be progressively hiring based on skills and competence rather than paper qualifications, I ask him about his views on whether the Government’s hiring practices are changing accordingly. Last year, it was reported that the Public Service Division (PSD) would stop distinguishing between graduates and non-graduates, and grouping employees into divisions according to their paper qualifications. Similar steps have been taken in the teaching profession to close the gap between graduates and non-graduates when it comes to salaries and promotions. But is there still an unspoken partiality towards hiring graduates? Can the civil service do more? “I would think yes, they can do more. It is doing more.   \"Academic qualification does matter, but don’t put everything on an academic university education. There are different kinds of qualifications out there now, all of which can signal whether the person has the competency to do the job. So be more open, don’t just insist on one type of academic qualifications.” He cites the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore as a “model employer”. “CAAS now takes diploma as well as degree graduates to become air traffic controllers. Whatever your qualification is, you come in as an air traffic controller, you go through their very rigorous training, after that you're on probation. And once your probation is over, you can be a very good, proficient air traffic controller. Everyone is paid based on performance. “I hope the civil service, or statutory boards, because they do have quite a bit of autonomy fixing their own hiring policy, take a hard look. When a job is skills-based in nature, really, there's no need to insist on different tiers of degrees, second-upper, first-class and so on. Really, hire based on skills and competencies.” He emphasises that certain professions do still require a degree though and there is value in it. “For example, don’t go to a doctor if he doesn’t have a degree, a medical degree. Certain professions you still need that degree, and therefore degree continues to be very useful.” I point out that we don’t have a single non-graduate minister today.  Can’t the Government more boldly set the tone? “We are products of an education system of the past. But today, you look at the education system, we have students who opt for a more applied pathway through the diploma route. So you look at the students now, they’re making their choices very differently from the past. I think when they grow up, if they have interest in politics, what will be the state of ministers in future. It's hard to say. I think you'll get a much more diverse group coming from different pathways. I certainly hope so.” SAGA OVER PARKING FOR TEACHERS WAS “UNNECESSARY” As we continue talking about education, Mr Ong acknowledges that teachers play a vital role. “My sympathies are totally with teachers. They have to face a lot of stress, a lot of demands from students, from parents, from MOE. But they are a very professional lot. I have great respect for teachers in MOE. It’s the backbone of our system. The entire quality of (the) education system really depends on the quality of teachers. They have displayed a tremendous level of professionalism.” However, I remark that the recent saga over teachers having to pay for parking on school premises might have left many of them feeling under-appreciated. The Auditor-General's Office (AGO) 2014/2015 Financial Year report noted that some educational institutions did not charge or undercharged for parking on their premises. It had called this a \"hidden subsidy\" which went against Government guidelines for public servants. MOE had said that since then, it had been working with the PSD and Ministry of Finance \"to determine an appropriate treatment for staff parking in schools\".  Many members of the public took to social media to make a case for free parking for teachers in return for the numerous sacrifices teachers make in their jobs every day. But the policy was implemented anyway. “It is really unnecessary in my view – the whole saga,” says Mr Ong. I ask him to clarify what he means since he had said in a Facebook post in May this year that charging parking fees at schools is about “upholding the value of self-discipline”. He had also said that “we have to respect our internal system of checks and balances. We cannot pick and choose which finding to address or comply with – we take them all seriously”.  So is he not on the authorities’ side on this? “It’s hard to argue against it,” he says to me. “We argued against it for a couple of years because between it being raised and being implemented was a good few years gap. That was the time we tried to talk to the authorities that feel there has to be parity in terms of every civil servant paying for parking at their workplace. But in the end, I think it's a principle that's hard to argue. So we explained to the teachers. Nobody likes to pay. But I do think the majority accepted it. We have implemented it. Let's just focus on the work from henceforth.” FOCUSSING ON THE WORK And the work is indeed what he seems to want to focus on. While Mr Ong has been widely touted as one of the front-runners to be the next Prime Minister of Singapore, he claims it’s something he doesn’t think about. “I really don’t want to think about that. If you’re an MP, be a good MP and if you're entrusted with a ministry, be a good minister. And that is where I am now. That should be my focus. I just want to be a good education minister, and there are so many things we need to do. So let's just focus on that. “Every ministry is a good ministry,” he adds with a grin. However, he recognises that more still needs to be done in his ministry and when I ask him what keeps him awake at night, he lists the tasks ahead of him. “Some of the issues you raised - do exams need to be so stressful, can we customise education without the labelling and stigmatisation and making people feel that they're being sorted? How do we make sure that as we progress in life, there are still many options, many paths, so that not everyone is focused on just that one academic path? How can we make sure that there's more joy in learning in schools, while maintaining the rigour, and not having so much rigour that you kill the joy of learning? So these are key issues that we need to resolve.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ong-ye-kung-education-minister-on-the-record-10651612"}, {"datetime": "26 Aug 2018 06:21AM", "tags": ["NDR 2018", "Lee Hsien Loong", "public housing", "HDB", "SERS", "en bloc"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Commentary: Windfalls and bailouts should not be an expected part of the public housing equation", "content": " SINGAPORE: Apprehensions over ageing HDB leases might have eased to some extent after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally speech. Mr Lee did well to explain why HDB leases are limited to 99 years and cannot be indefinitely renewed, for the sake of future generations and for social and practical reasons. While understanding the reasons, Singaporeans can look forward to other options that could see older flats retain their value for a longer period. The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) will be expanded to cover more flats, and the new HIP II scheme will give all HDB flats a second round of upgrading when they reach the 60 to 70-year mark. Residents can also look to the possibility of the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). CONSIDER THE UNKNOWNS However, while considering these and other options in the public housing ecosystem, Singaporeans would do well to manage their expectations and exercise prudence in their choices. National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has already warned against playing up expectations that VERS will help prop up the resale market. Clearly, there is a chance your precinct may not be selected for VERS and even if it is, the majority of residents could still very well vote against it. Last year, Mr Wong’s reminder that HDB flats would be returned to the state at the end of their 99-year lease was accompanied by advice that buyers should not fork out large sums for old resale flats on the chance that they may profit from the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). Only 4 per cent of Singapore’s public housing stock had been selected for SERS since the scheme began in 1995, but many HDB dwellers seemed to believe that the majority of them would benefit from the scheme at some point. While the recent moderation of HDB resale prices may have disappointed sellers, some analysts argue that the moderating effect on resale prices has been positive. After all, runaway prices created anxiety among current and future flat buyers and are unsustainable in the long run. The possibility of VERS might have a stabilising effect on the resale market on the whole, but again let’s not forget the various unknowns.  For instance, the terms for VERS have yet to be worked out, but we have already been warned that they will be less generous than those of SERS. Whatever the case, buyers need to see this scheme as a bonus rather than a given when making their purchasing decisions. Taking this stance has its advantages. For instance, it could continue moderating the market, ensuring reasonable affordability for generations of Singaporeans. Home buyers would also more likely make our housing decisions more prudently, and take fewer risky decisions that could ultimately impact our savings, including those under CPF that should provide for our retirement. BEING COGNISANT OF THE TERMS Many young flat owners think they would probably sell their flats and move to something bigger and better long before their 99-year lease runs out. Over the years, such aspirations and a focus on profits might have also prevented many from fully coming to terms with the finiteness of HDB leases. While the Prime Minister has assured Singaporeans that once the lease runs out, the Government “will help you to get another flat to live in”, he also said “whichever option you choose, you will have to pay for the lease”. Mr Lee explained it is only fair “because you bought the original flat knowing when the lease would run out, and knowing that the flat would then have to be returned to HDB”. However, in spite of this, there was clearly a belief in some quarters that the state would feel a duty to provide some form of compensation before or at the end of 99 years, whether through SERS or some other scheme. Recent statements and discussions on this issue have hopefully driven home the message that we shouldn’t expect the Government to entirely bail us out of the housing decisions we made for ourselves. We must understand the terms from the outset, manage our expectations and in the process, be cognisant of what our choices ultimately mean for us and our families. If we choose to buy a resale flat with only a few decades left on the lease, do we have plans to move somewhere else after and are we able to set aside money to finance this? Or do we want our flat to be an inheritance that can be passed down to our children, despite the fact that its lease will run down eventually? How would this then determine how much we are willing to pay for it at the outset? THE OBJECTIVES OF PUBLIC HOUSING FOR US AND FUTURE GENERATIONS While most of our HDB flats have gone up in price compared to when we first bought them, public housing is clearly not an asset that will invariably grow in value no matter the conditions. The public housing system as a whole is designed to provide housing security for not just the current generation, but future generations of Singaporeans. But an HDB flat is designed to house one generation at a time; hence the need for finite 99-year leases so that the land can be redeveloped after for the next generation who have to pay their share for their house. National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has stressed the need to ensure that fiscal arrangements for VERS are sustainable. This will undoubtedly determine the terms offered to residents. We might be about 20 years away from Singapore’s first VERS project but clearly any indication of how it will be ultimately rolled out will be of great interest to home owners and future buyers. In determining the merits of current and future schemes, individuals need to step back and look at their flat as not just an asset, but a home. In this equation, windfalls and bailouts should not and cannot be seen as a given.

Why do something stupid like that?”  The idea that he had was a food delivery service called Fastbee, which allowed people to order hawker delights via an app and collect their food from nearby vending machines.  Mr Khoo believed that this would incur lower costs than a conventional point-to-point delivery model and in turn, be more sustainable and scalable.  At the end of last year, Fastbee expanded to 10 vending machines across various industrial and business parks in the West. More than 800 deliveries were made per week from a team of just seven people.  Unfortunately, it could not withstand a double whammy of competition from new players and fundraising difficulties that soon came along. The start-up had its last day on Aug 14.  But nothing ventured, nothing gained, said Mr Khoo.  “Maybe I should be happy that I lasted for about two years,” he quipped. “After all, statistics out there say about 90 per cent of start-ups fail in a year.”  THE ENTREPRENEURIAL ITCH A former student of the Anglo-Chinese Junior College and Nanyang Technological University, Mr Khoo described himself as someone who rarely veered off the beaten path.  Taking a risk, such as entrepreneurship, never crossed his mind until he was introduced to the Lean Start-up methodology at work.  Coined by Silicon Valley entrepreneurial guru Eric Ries, the methodology emphasised experimentation, like quickly launching a product then change it based on market feedback, instead of elaborate planning.  He was tasked to adopt this innovation philosophy to build a new industry for Singapore but felt “something missing” and that he needed more than just reading materials to fully grasp the concept.  “Innovation, the Lean Start-up methodology – these were often discussed but how do you get answers about starting something from scratch and making it work? Do I ask my boss or do I read more books?”  Disruption becoming the new normal and technology changing jobs also got him thinking if he had become too comfortable in his work. “I was somehow semi-cruising and contented with life,” said Mr Khoo. “But the world is changing and there’s actually so much to do and learn.”  He considered applying for an MBA but eventually concluded that the answer lies in getting his hands dirty. So in October 2016, he left his eight-year career at the EDB.  A steep learning curve awaited him in the initial months as he took the dive into entrepreneurship.  From lacklustre demand for his “primitive version” of Fastbee (a breakfast delivery service in the Central Business District), new guidelines for vending machines to manpower and logistics issues, Mr Khoo recalled having “a reason to close down almost every month”.  “There was once when I was going to launch a new machine at a new location but the third-party logistics provider I was partnering couldn’t deliver. I suddenly find myself with no drivers to fulfil orders,” he said.  “It was such a stressful day that I nearly felt like throwing in the towel.”  Each time, he tweaked his model and soldiered on.  With its focus on the underserved market of delivering humbler local fare to non-CBD areas, business grew and Mr Khoo felt confident enough to add new vending machines by end-2017.  “After surviving the initial months, I thought nothing else can kill me,” he recalled. “But I was wrong.” At its core, Fastbee relied on aggregating orders and eliminating point-to-point deliveries to stay lean and keep costs down. Unlike other food delivery services, it does not take a cut or have a minimum order requirement. Its main income is a S$1.50 delivery fee.  While it does have lower manpower costs, it required economies of scale to turn profitable. At its peak, Fastbee only had a footprint of 10 vending machines.  By early 2018, its capital of S$200,000, consisting of S$100,000 from Mr Khoo and the rest put in by an angel investor, was fast running out. Months of fundraising, however, yielded little results.  “Eventually, I realised that we were simply not growing fast enough,” said Mr Khoo. “We may be growing 10 to 20 per cent in our customer base but venture capitalists are looking at super-normal growth of 100 to 200 per cent.”  Investors also questioned the exportability of the start-up. “We are a solution for Singapore where manpower is expensive, but that’s not the case for the rest of Southeast Asia. So they were sceptical.”  At the same time, new entrants with deeper pockets have begun targeting its stronghold of industrial and business parks in the West. With its coffers running dry, Mr Khoo said Fastbee could not match the extensive marketing efforts, such as dishing out promo codes, that some of its rivals have done.  To hold on, it began reducing its vending machines while tweaking operations to have one delivery man for four locations.  “We always needed about 30 packets for breakeven but with that, it took just eight to 10 packets.”  That kept the start-up going for four more months until talks with an investor fell through on Aug 9. By then, Mr Khoo knew the time was up.  “I sat in front of my laptop and wept a bit. Even though I had been preparing myself, it wasn’t easy when the realisation hit.”  When asked if he had been too confident on Fastbee’s lean model, Mr Khoo’s face turned pensive.  “I still believe in the concept of using a vending machine because right till the end, we were breaking even operationally. But we needed investments to keep going.  “With the consolidation going on in the market, interest was low. Nobody wants to invest in a small start-up and hope you can survive against the big guys.” NO REGRETS Without a salary and having to dig deep into his savings for his daily expenses, Mr Khoo estimated that he has spent about S$200,000 on his entrepreneurial pursuits.  But there are no regrets, he said, as he’s gained valuable lessons in return. For instance, he should have kept a tighter lid on spending in the initial stages of the business. “Everyone told me that I needed to bootstrap. You will try but you won’t do it until you are desperate,” said Mr Khoo. “We were not overspending compared to many start-ups but we were not stingy enough. Only when we ran out did we realise that we could have slashed a lot of spending by becoming even more efficient.” This will involve walking the talk on embracing innovation and out-of-the-box thinking, added Mr Khoo. For this, he credited his young team for constantly reminding him of the value of taking a chance on something new. “Towards the end, I told my team that we needed to radically change our operations. They took it and we started brainstorming together. That’s how we pivoted our model when we needed to.” Having family support would be crucial for any entrepreneur though Mr Khoo admitted that his mother disapproved of his career switch. “My brother had a business failure in his 30s and lost a similar amount of money. My mum went through that with him and she obviously didn’t want me to end up the same.” He added: “Plus, I was doing quite well in EDB so she could not understand why I wanted to quit.” His business has been a taboo topic at home for the past two years. But there was once after an argument, Mr Khoo received a text message from his mum reminding him to take regular meals and rest when he can.  “I remembered being on my way back to the office. When I saw the message, I stopped and cried uncontrollably for 10 minutes.  \"I know she’s been very worried about us failing and having a tough life as a result of that.”  Bringing up the deep-seated fear of failure in Singapore, he added: “The older generation still views entrepreneurship and the risks involved very differently and I know from here, there will be certain pressure that my family and I will have to face.”  “So when the realisation hit, I did think about what I should do for the next Chinese New Year. Should I still go for visiting?” Mr Khoo also candidly let on that he initially thought it would be rather “paiseh”, which means embarrassed in Hokkien, to do an interview but he now hopes to help dispel that fear of failure.  “I’ve previously given a few talks on entrepreneurship. Obviously now, I can’t tell a success story but perhaps I can tell the other side of becoming an entrepreneur given that so few people talk about failures and what we learn from them.”  On his next step, Mr Khoo admits to feeling some trepidation though he was quick to add that there is no time to wallow in failure.  “After spending S$200,000, I need to build up my nest again,” he said with a laugh.  But more importantly, he has come to realise that life is not a race and that one failure does not mean losing out forever.  “Bouts of ‘I’m single, turning 35, don’t have a career and probably can’t afford a HDB’ definitely went through my mind but I really don’t think I’m in the worst place.  “If I compare myself with my peers, I may be a few years behind but this is not a race. I still have many years ahead of me to make the best out of my life.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/i-d-do-it-all-over-again-says-founder-of-failed-start-up-fastbee-10638012"}, {"datetime": "26 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["poverty", "India", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "He took out his life savings in Singapore to rescue children in India", "content": " GORAKHPUR, INDIA: Fascinated by a boy turning cartwheels and performing somersaults outside a railway station, Mr Ravi Rai Manas leaned forward for a closer look, and was horrified by the sight of maggots wriggling beside a wound on the boy’s head. With a smile, the boy, oblivious to his condition, stretched out his hands and asked for money. The startled Singaporean promptly led the eight-year-old to a doctor, who removed eight maggots from his head. “It was the first time I had seen maggots,” said Mr Rai, 56. “The boy had hurt himself performing for money. He had no money to see a doctor, and he scratched his wound till it became bigger.” The boy, who left home when he was six, was living alone on the streets of Gorakhpur city, surviving on very little money from begging and performing. That encounter in 2000, two years after Mr Rai started the organisation Children of Mother Earth (Come) in his ancestral village of Pharsar, cemented the former civil engineer’s conviction to help poor children, including runaways, orphans and victims of trafficking. The organisation rescues and rehabilitates them by providing clothing, education, food and shelter. And in the case of the beggar-boy, named Soneo, who took refuge in Come for eight months, he was also reunited with his family in another village, Mr Rai said proudly. His mission in India is featured in a four-part On The Red Dot special, as celebrity chef Robin Ho tracks down Singaporeans who have gone off the beaten track to work for a social good. (Watch the episode here.) FIRST GLIMPSE OF POVERTY In 1998, Mr Rai left Singapore with his life savings of S$300,000 to return to the northern tip of Uttar Pradesh state. It is among India’s most backward regions, with poor roads and minimal power supply in many villages. And it had been calling to him since he glimpsed its poverty on his first trip to India as a 10-year-old accompanying his parents to visit relatives in their ancestral home. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “There were children walking around with no slippers and torn clothes during winter (temperatures dropping to 7 to 8°C). And they had little food,” he recalled. “I’d never witnessed anything like this. It opened my eyes to poverty.” His parents encouraged him to share his belongings with them – his extra pair of slippers, books and food. “(The children) appreciated me sharing things with them, and I started reading and thinking about life,” he said. Born in Singapore, he completed primary school here before leaving for India to study, eventually graduating in civil engineering from a university in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. He returned to Singapore to work as a civil engineer, with another purpose in mind: To save money to help the poor in India, especially the children. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When he was 35, thinking he had saved enough, he told his parents he was leaving Singapore. “I was very clear about what I was going to do,” said Mr Rai, who would also have a rental income of S$2,000 from his three-room flat in Dover Road. His mother was concerned about his safety, while his father, who has since died, encouraged him. A young Ravi had accompanied his dad to distribute necessities to the poor in Pharsar, and that generosity “rubbed off on me”, he said. My father said he was very proud of me having chosen this path. He told me, ‘This is the way life should be, to give back to society.' “He was my guru,\" added Mr Rai. ‘OUR HOME’ So he quit his comfortable life in Singapore, relocated to India and converted the second floor of his ancestral home to house destitute children. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “This is our boarding facility. They live here until the age of 10. After that, depending on their needs, we transfer them to other centres,” he said. Inscribed on the building is the phrase “humanity is our religion, earth is our motherland”. “Religion is a very sensitive issue in this area. Children from any religion, if they come here for help, will be given help. Humanity means helping each other, and that should be the real way of living,” he explained. The not-for-profit organisation started with 20 children but has since expanded to four centres across India, with over 200 children. Its Gorakhpur centre is situated in an old railway shed, where the older boys study and live. It is called Apna Ghar (“our home” in Hindi), a name given by the children. “They tell me that whenever the police or people ask where they’re going, they’d say, ‘We’re going to our home. We’re going to Apna Ghar,’” Mr Rai said. It took him some time to feel at home, however, living as he did with no salary, no internet access and just eight hours of electricity a day. He said: Can you imagine how a Singaporean would feel? But some of the children were learning, and that gave me strength. The material needs became secondary. VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING Many of the children he has rescued had been beggars at Gorakhpur’s railway station. Most of them came from villages. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “The people in the villages are relatively poorer, so whenever the family faces some problem, (the children) would go to the cities, and they end up at the railway station,” he said. Up to 100,000 lost and runaway children arrive at India’s railway stations every year. They beg, sell drinks and cigarettes or work illegally during the day, and sleep in the streets at night, huddled together for warmth in winter. Some of them end up in the hands of syndicates, becoming victims of the organ or sex trades. And Gorakhpur is reported to be emerging as one of India’s biggest child trafficking hubs. In April, non-governmental organisation Safe Society claimed to have found over 500 victims there in the last three years. “A lot of traffickers are here for the children,” confirmed Mr Rai. “They make them work in tea stalls and don’t pay them. Some later end up in gangs … There are older boys connected to criminals, and they get involved in pickpocketing, stealing and snatching.” Given that he approaches children at the stations to offer help, he has been questioned many times by the police, who suspected he was a trafficker. He was even detained at a police station once, but was released after a senior officer vouched for him. LETTING GO OF THE EGO One of Mr Rai’s greatest challenges came when he started to run out of funds after three years. He had a “big ego”, never would he take donations to fund his operations “because of what people would think about me”, he admitted. “I was too concerned about it.” The turning point was the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. He went there with S$15,000 to help a village, having refused help from his friends and relatives who wanted to donate money. His S$15,000, for building shelters for those who lost their homes, lasted barely a week. “I started thinking about my principle of not taking donations. I was going to leave, but I saw that the people were still suffering. It wasn’t right,” he said. “I had a big conflict between my heart and my mind.” Today, his organisation receives contributions from donors in Singapore, the United States and from the Indian government. Mr Rai, who said he is still not on a salary, employs some 25 staff in total, plus volunteers from the US, Singapore and China. REUNITING FAMILIES One of their priorities is to reunite children with their family before they fall prey to syndicates, and because their parents “must be worried and would be looking for them”, said Mr Rai. Sometimes the parents have abandoned them. I want to know where they come from so that, in future, if the child ever wants to go back, we know the address. On one occasion, the On The Red Dot team followed him to find the family of a young runaway who had turned up at the Gorakhpur station. The boy, Mohan, claimed that his father had beaten him, which was why he ran away – one of the many reasons that children leave home, noted Mr Rai. Sometimes they are bullied by their elder siblings, or they simply did not want to study. In Mohan’s case, the team eventually tracked down his home after a few hours of searching. “As we approached the family … (there) was anger and then surprise. ‘What’s going on? Who are these people coming to our village?’ And then it became sadness. But eventually, I think, love took over – there was some forgiveness,” described Mr Ho. Mohan was lucky, as some children who run away to the city are often sold, sometimes maimed, and forced into begging, Mr Rai told the boy’s father. A MORE MEANINGFUL LIFE On another occasion, Mr Rai accompanied one of his charges, Gopal, to visit his family in Gorakhpur. The family beg for a living, which gives them less than US$2 (S$2.70) a day, barely enough to stay alive. Their home is basically a shelter with some plastic sheets, propped up by bamboo. Gopal has two siblings who are still begging at railway stations, and Mr Ho observed that they looked dirty and “completely different” from their brother, with their long, unkempt hair. “Ravi tried to convince the other boys to come to the home so that he could provide them with education and shelter,” said Mr Ho. “I also saw their brother trying to ask. “But I think the brothers were stopped by their parents because they needed them to continue to beg.” To date, Come has rescued, sheltered and provided education for over 2,000 children, and transformed their lives. Asked if he missed Singapore after all this time, Mr Rai said he returns home once or twice a year to visit his family and friends and to recharge. “This place encourages me a lot – everything works here. In India, there’s no system,” he said with a laugh. But I’m happy to have chosen this life. It’s more meaningful. I can make a difference. His plan for the future is to start an academy in India that would be similar to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges in Singapore. “I want to focus more on vocational training for some of these kids. They don’t have enough colleges like the ITE,” he said. “I want to open some so that these children don’t loiter in the streets and hang out at railway stations.” Ravi Rai Manas is one of four Singaporeans on a social mission abroad who feature in On The Red Dot.

Speaking to reporters after the arrival of Singapore’s swimming, gymnastics and fencing teams at Changi Airport on Saturday (Aug 25), Schooling paid tribute to his younger team-mates. \"We have a lot of young talent coming up - relays were great, I was very excited about that,\" said Schooling. \"The future of Singapore swimming is very bright and we have time before (the) Tokyo (Olympics). I think we’re going to get better and better every year.\" Singapore national swimmers ended their Asian Games campaign on Friday with six medals - two golds, a silver and three bronzes. Schooling won gold in both the 50m and 100m butterfly, and helped the men's 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relay teams to bronze. Roanne Ho, 25, won a silver in the women's 50m breaststroke after Japan's Miho Teramura was disqualified, while the women's 4x100m medley relay won a bronze, also after disqualifications. Schooling, 23, was quick to single out two youngsters, Chua and Tan, for their standout showings. The quartet of Schooling, Quah Zheng Wen, Chua and Darren Lim set a new national record in the men’s 4x100m freestyle relay while Tan, Schooling, Quah and Danny Yeo combined to clock a new national record in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay. “Those two swims among a lot of other swims really stood out for me - I actually feel very excited talking about it right now,” Schooling added. Some updated stats from the #OneTeamSG Swimming team’s #AsianGames outing. Here’s what they bring home:2️⃣ Asian Games golds 1️⃣ Asian Games silver 3️⃣ Asian Games bronzes 7️⃣ National Records1️⃣5️⃣ Personal Bests1️⃣ Asian Games RecordSensational.  According to national head coach Stephan Widmer, Schooling's gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was a catalyst for these successes. \"Joseph had started to give Singaporeans the belief that Singaporeans can compete with the best in the world,\" said Widmer. “Now you can see coaches believe, swimmers believe and it's a great momentum. \"These kids have prepared, they not just have physical abilities but they have mental abilities and they did really well and (did) the nation proud.\" For Tan - a Games debutant and the anchor of his relay team - the achievements of his seniors, including Schooling, have given him new confidence. \"Before I knew them or trained with them, I always thought that SEA Games was the maximum you can go. After Jo won ... it just gives you the belief that it is possible. Singapore has the capability of producing such athletes.\" But with powerhouses China and Japan finishing the swimming competition with 19 gold medals apiece, part of the challenge will now be for the next generation of Singapore swimmers to bridge the gap.  \"They have a great sporting history - those two countries are sports powerhouses,\" said Schooling. \"I think Stefan brought up a good point - he said that we got the third highest medal count behind China and Japan. So, we’re getting there, right?” For the young swimmers, Schooling’s exploits remind them that they can challenge swimmers from regional powerhouses. \"It pushes us a lot. Seeing him being able to win a gold medal, it's like - any Singaporean can do it,\" said Chua. \"It helps to motivate us to want to win a medal, to train even harder and get into the Olympic level.\" Added fellow youngster Cherlyn Yeoh: \"He has excellent work ethic, the way he trains is really hard and he is not complacent about his Olympic gold medal.  \"You always see him training hard - pushing himself in training and it motivates you. If he's pushing himself so hard, then why can’t I?\" Get the widest coverage of the 18th Asian Games (Aug 18 – Sep 2) from Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia on Mediacorp.

Seven suspected drug offenders, all of whom are Singaporean, were arrested. In a statement, CNB said its officers were deployed to observe the hideout of a suspected drug trafficker near Woodlands Crescent. The suspect, a 35-year-old male, was believed to be dealing in a sizeable quantity of drugs. During the observation, CNB officers spotted another suspected drug trafficker, a 43-year-old male, entering the hideout. Using specialised forcible entry tools, officers from CNB’s Special Task Force burst into the unit and arrested both men before they were able to dispose of the drugs. A total of 2.9kg of heroin, 2kg of cannabis, 100g of Ice, 45 ecstasy tablets and a bottle of methadone were found. Cash amounting to S$21,170 was also seized. Two female suspects in the unit, a 30-year-old and a 32-year-old, were also arrested. The 35-year-old man fainted during the search of the hideout, and was taken to hospital by ambulance. CNB also arrested three other known associates of the 35-year-old male suspect on the same day. Two of the suspects, a 42-year-old male and a 48-year-old male, were arrested in a unit at around Jurong East Street 24. Police also seized about 12g of Ice and a small amount of cannabis from the premises. The other known associate, a 48-year-old male, was arrested at Yishun Avenue 11. About 630g of heroin and 50g of Ice were also recovered. Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.

We were banging on Jo to deliver but we had more than just Jo delivering this time.  \"Especially for the relays we have been fantastic, it has created more belief as well for the community. And swimmers would want to be on that relay team right now and we know that there is a big opportunity for us to expand on that thought process as well,\" added the two-time Olympian.  Olympic champion Joseph Schooling led the way with four medals, one more than the three he won in the previous edition of the tournament in Incheon in 2014. Schooling won gold in both the 50m and 100m butterfly, and helped the men’s 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relay teams to bronze. Meanwhile, Roanne Ho clinched a surprise silver medal in the 50m breaststroke and the women’s 4x100m relay medley team snagged bronze. Widmer highlighted that out of the 25 swimmers in the team who travelled to the Asian Games, 13 will head home with at least one medal in their bags.  \"Some of the medals were from (them contributing in the) heats as well ... but in total more than half the team actually go home with a medal. That is exceptional for the team of this size and the Asian Games, as you can tell, competition is just getting tougher and tougher.\"  SEVEN NEW NATIONAL RECORDS  On top of the medals, the team also broke seven national records in Jakarta.  Ho, Quah Jing Wen, Glen Lim and Gan Ching Hwee all set new national marks for the 50m breaststroke, 200m butterfly, 800m freestyle and 1,500m freestyle events respectively. The men's 4x100m freestyle, men's 4x200m freestyle and women's 4x100m freestyle relay teams also set new national records in Jakarta.  But despite that, Widmer acknowledged that there is still a gap between Singapore and Asian swimming powerhouses China and Japan. Both countries finished their respective swimming campaigns with 19 gold medals.  \"For sure (there's a gap). The first gap is the talent pool, our population, but that should never be an excuse. To me the gap is our culture still, what we do on a day to day basis, (but) we can't have any excuses,\" said Widmer.  \"Are we there yet? Definitely not. I totally agree that there is a gap. But we are pushing hard to fill the gap,\" added the Swiss-born coach who has been credited with the development of Olympic champions Libby Trickett, Leisel Jones and Jessicah Schipper.  Looking ahead to the future, Tan and Widmer said that the Singapore team is in a good position to make some impact in the world championships in 2019.  \"They're in a very good position right now, but absolutely nothing has happened towards that moment. So the athletes still have to come back from a short break, more willing to put in more work, to push harder to endure more pain and all these things,\" Widmer said.   Additional reporting by Matthew Mohan  Get the widest coverage of the 18th Asian Games (Aug 18 – Sep 2) from Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia on Mediacorp.

That question would likely summon images of a grand Beverly Hills mansion or a luxurious skyscraper penthouse in London. But Wong Kah Chun, chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra, calls his Jurong West HDB flat “the best because it is home”. His story, told by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally (NDR) this week, will have likely resonated with many Singaporeans who value the simple, sturdy comforts of home. BOLD MOVES ON HOUSING RECEIVED STRONG SUPPORT It wasn’t just Wong’s story that threw housing in the spotlight at NDR 2018. Many bold plans were announced. A new programme to redevelop more HDB flats before the end of their lease known as the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) received praise, as did the announced expansion of the Home Improvement Programme. For months, some people have been watching for the Government’s response as discussions have developed about HDB flats being returned to the state when their lease runs out and the implications for the value of people’s homes. Interest in the issue was sparked by the announcement last June that land occupied by residences at Lorong 3 Geylang would be taken back by SLA when their lease expires in 2020. Prior to that, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had posted on Facebook to remind people of this fact. That prompted some people to ask if they would be “stuck” with a flat they couldn’t sell because the Government will take it back after 99 years. Several housing experts weighed in to discuss the implications and suggest ideas to tackle this conundrum. Consider the gradual privatisation of all HDB flats or shift the housing model towards renting, said one. But study the impact of any policy review on retirement adequacy and on CPF savings, said another. In this context, PM Lee’s announcement that the Government will take back eligible precincts after they reach 70 years or more and help residents get another flat under VERS fired a salvo in the face of concerns. There are uncertainties and conditions, like needing most residents to say yes to VERS after selection and compensation will be less generous than under SERS, the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme. But while the details are still to be worked out, the broad policy is a reassuring signal that the importance of people’s relationship with their homes is understood and potential policy problems will be addressed. This move was strengthened to give owners of larger flats more options in unlocking the value of their apartments, when Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced the following day that the Lease Buyback Scheme would be expanded to cover all HDB flats. A PROBLEM NOT FOR MANY YEARS YET KEENLY FELT BY THE YOUNG Some ask why worry over expiring leases now, when the issue would only rear its ugly head many decades from now? After all, the vast majority of flats have more than 60 years of leases remaining. But for someone whose grandparents live in Queenstown, where some HDB flats have leases that will expire in about 50 years, I share the anxieties about the fate of these first mass use cases. The image of elderly residents having to vacate their homes after their lease expires troubles me when I meet families there, even though this scenario will not apply to my grandparents, as they are in their 90s. Each time I walk along Stirling Road from the MRT station to their home, and pass by blocks of flats as old as theirs, I shudder at the possibility that Singapore might end up with run-down “ghost towns” of neighbourhoods of apartments no one wants to buy because their leases have passed the half-way mark and shuttered shops which no one wants to rent because of low foot-fall. So it’s not just a worry about expiring leases but of estates emptying out and decaying as neighbourhoods age. YOUNG SINGAPOREANS WANT THE SAME SOCIAL COMPACT OUR PIONEER GENERATION HAD Yet, this bleak outlook is not congruent with my grandparents’ views about housing. In fact, my grandparents’ experience suggests many of the pioneer generation of Singaporeans have come to regard their flat not just as a reliable roof above their heads but an almost unshakeable assurance of social security across the years. They say their flat was a refuge against the daily toil and life’s uncertainties in Singapore’s first decades as a young nation. They are also beneficiaries of the heavily subsidised Home Improvement Programme, and have seen a new utility room added coupled with the replacement of ageing bits like the toilets, pipes and windows a few years back. They enjoy having breakfast at nearby Mei Ling Street Market, which was recently renovated and made more vibrant, attracting more friendly faces to the area. While they appreciate the physical works, what these upgrading exercises represent to them is an affirmation that the value of their homes can be preserved. And they don’t just mean dollars and cents. Many observers focus on this generation benefiting from higher housing prices. Indeed, my grandparents’ flat is now worth 40 times what they paid in 1971. But when I talk to them about Queenstown, what gets first mention is how proud they are of their spruced-up home and how upbeat about the future they feel when they see that neighbourhood amenities are modern and buzzing with activity. HOUSING AS SOCIAL COMPACT RESOUNDINGLY INTACT Access to affordable, quality housing in vibrant neighbourhoods is not some abstract concept, but a lived reality most Singaporeans have a stake in. More than 90 per cent of residents are homeowners, and 80 per cent live in HDB flats. In this context, these bold moves on housing have provided stronger reassurances and strengthened it as a key pillar of Singapore’s social compact. We may be 20 years away from the first case of VERS, but its announcement has given many neighbours where my grandparents live some confidence of an option when the flat reaches 70 years or so, if their precinct gets selected. Many also tell me they now see a longer-term future in Queenstown, and look forward to the possibility of another upgrading under the Home Improvement Programme II announced by PM Lee, and more broadly to their estate being revitalised over time with redevelopment. NEVER DONE BUILDING SINGAPORE There was one more thing at NDR that moved me - the CGI showing a visualisation of the Punggol waterway area played at the rally almost 10 years ago superimposed with recent footage of the neighbourhood shot by a drone from the same angle. It was an exciting sight to see what was planned for a decade ago has now materialised.  For my younger sister, who has just moved into a brand new apartment on Anchorvale Crescent with her husband and newborn son, this bright reality underscores this social compact. She speaks often to my grandparents and hears the same positive tales about what makes Queenstown their home. And like many new homeowners of our generation, she hopes to enjoy the same assurances about housing my grandparents were privileged to. “We will never be done building Singapore”, PM Lee said at the end of his rally speech. But it’s assuring to see this strong political commitment to long-term planning, which has underpinned public housing for the pioneer generation of Singaporeans, undergird this social compact for a new generation of Singaporeans who call Singapore home.

Yet five months ago he tried the treatment in a bid to fix his erectile dysfunction (ED) - and it worked. “People might be put off by the word 'shockwave', but there’s nothing to be afraid of. It was painless, there was no discomfort,” he described. “And it is effective. My performance has improved … it’s much better now.” Despite the name, shockwave therapy actually uses external, low-intensity acoustics to trigger a process that forms new blood vessels, improving blood flow to the nether regions to help enhance the firmness of an erection. “Part of the reason for ED could be inflammation of the blood vessels or damaged tissue - and what shockwave therapy does is create better-quality tissue,” said Dr Lim Kok Bin, a urologist who has been offering the treatment at his Raffles Hospital clinic since 2016. He added that the technology is not new, having long been used to address joint pains as well as break down kidney stones - albeit at energy levels of 100 times more. Along the spectrum of ED remedies, shockwave therapy sits between oral medication like the instantly recognisable Viagra and invasive procedures such as injections and prosthetic implants. For Travis, the latter was a big no-no. He has also tried “non-conventional” supplements including traditional Chinese medicine and Viagra, but one proved ineffectual and the other produced side effects like blurred vision and headaches - so he turned to this other approach. “SCARY-SOUNDING” Shockwave therapy is a more recent development than the 20-year-old blue pill of Viagra, having been first published in European research papers at the turn of the 2010s and only arriving in Singapore in 2014. Today it is readily available here at private clinics, Raffles Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, National University Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. But the treatment remains little-known: Travis believes this is due to ED being a topic “not openly discussed” to begin with, and Dr Lim put it down to a lack of advertising. A further barrier could be what Dr Tan Kok Kuan, who runs a group of sexual health clinics, acknowledged as the “scary-sounding” name and notion - however ill-conceived - of shockwave therapy. “The only scary thing about the treatment is that it is rather loud,” said Dr Tan, who is Travis' doctor. “It is completely non-invasive and completely painless. “It feels very much like an ultrasound scan. Gel is placed on the probe and the probe is placed against the skin at the groin and the penis. If you touch the probe with your finger, you barely feel a tapping sensation,” he added. “Patients feel nothing at all. In fact, many of my patients fall asleep during the treatment.” Dr Lim reiterated: “I’m not sticking anything into your body, I’m not cutting you up. Nobody complains about pain - only one patient was a bit sensitive and jumped a bit. Nothing could go wrong.” It was with those words as a guarantee that this reporter - who does not have ED - agreed to experience a standard 15-minute session involving 1,000 “shocks” on each of five different spots. Yes, that adds up to 5,000 in total which sounded absolutely terrifying as I lay down on Dr Lim’s examination table, shivering in part from the cold of being exposed from the waist down and in part out of naked fear. But it was too late to turn back, and I clenched my teeth as he fired up the machine and went to work ...  As the doctors described, there was a bit of a din, which caused initial panic and the imagination of being repeatedly smacked down there. But I quickly realised that aside from a little warmth and a slight pattering sensation with each supposed “shock”, there was no pain at all. It ended as quickly as it started, and with no need to worry about future repercussions, both doctors reassured. Said Dr Lim: “Only two things will happen: It either helps you or doesn’t. The worst that could happen is it has no effect.” He has administered shockwave therapy to around 20 patients, with only two not responding “very well” to the treatment due to psychological factors. Dr Tan, meanwhile, said: “I have treated more than 500 cases and I can safely say they have all seen some level of improvement, some more than others.” FIXING MEN’S PROBLEMS FOREVER? Dr Tan also quipped: “The joke I have with my patients is the only ‘side effect’ is injuring the wallet.” Patients generally require six sessions divided over two to three weeks, costing in total between S$2,000 and S$5,000, depending on the clinic. For Dr Lim, each round of six sessions lasts for a couple of years, while Dr Tan recommends returning for one session a year “to maintain the beneficial effects”. Dr Lim pointed out that a two-year stretch of taking Viagra - with each pill costing around S$20 - would work out to around S$2,000 as well. Shockwave therapy has also been touted in certain circles as a potential permanent cure for ED, compared to the temporary relief provided by Viagra. And in March this year a study recommended, for the first time, guidelines for optimal therapy at six to 18 sessions depending on the severity of the ED. Nonetheless Dr Lim said it was still a work-in-progress with further protocols to be established, such as when to administer the treatment again. “I would still prefer giving oral medication,” he noted. “If the patient is already doing so and it’s not helping, then I’ll suggest trying shockwave therapy while continuing to take medicine.” Added Dr Tan: “I am very hesitant to use the word ‘permanent’. That would imply if a patient undergoes this treatment when he is 45 years old, he still will not have ED when he is 80 years old. This obviously cannot be the case. “Not all patients with ED will benefit from this treatment,” he explained, pointing to additional psychological and other medical factors as possible issues. “This treatment is only for men with mild to moderate ED caused by blood vessel disease. “Therefore, patient selection is very important. Also, managing the patient's expectations is important.” For Travis, though, the clear advantage of shockwave therapy lies in its facilitation of spontaneous, naturally occurring erections - unlike with pills, which have to be planned for and taken at set times before sex. The result has been a happy spouse and a couple now eager to try for kids. “I think I’ll keep doing this for the rest of my life, if I have to,” he said, adding he was already looking forward to his next session with Dr Tan. “Need to recharge!”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/shockwave-therapy-erectile-dysfunction-viagra-10644552"}, {"datetime": "25 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["MOM", "Manpower", "Construction"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Keeping employees safe and sound: On patrol with workplace safety inspectors", "content": " SINGAPORE: In two cars, four safety inspectors pulled up outside a warehouse, about the size of three basketball courts, in Joo Koon Circle. “Where is the front gate? Why are there no directional signs?” asked 24-year-old Siti Hajar Salim in a perplexed tone. She was taking the lead in the operation and was acting as navigator to her buddy-mentor Aidil Mohamed Riduan, 39. The group is from the Ministry of Manpower’s Occupational Safety and Health Division, and they were inspecting a supply company. The division has already carried out more than 2,600 inspections this year. The inspection, carried out earlier this month, was part of Operation Junco which targets workplaces where there are greater risks from accidents involving vehicles, such as warehouses, shipyards, construction worksites and delivery businesses. The focus on such businesses comes against a backdrop of incidents involving vehicles being the leading cause of fatal injuries at work for the past three years. There were 14 such deaths in 2017 and they included being struck by moving vehicles, work-related traffic incidents on public roads and being caught in between vehicles. The supply company occupying the warehouse space was last visited in August 2016, and was due for a new inspection, said the MOM officers. Two years ago, the company flouted several safety regulations and was let off with a warning. Findings from the previous inspection include leaving forklift keys in the ignition unattended, and obstructing the emergency exit door. BEING FAST, FIRM AND BLUNT Once inside the warehouse, Ms Hajar whipped out her iPad and started taking photos of everything she saw that could potentially contravene safety rules even before speaking to warehouse managers and workers. Catching her attention was a battered forklift haphazardly operated by a worker between storage racks. She then introduced herself to the warehouse manager Mr Lim, and conducted a briefing about the day’s inspection with him – such as asking for documents like the factory’s blueprint, products they carry and clarifying the number of workers and industrial vehicles. “Mr Lim, just now I noticed one worker. Who is that? Can you call him over please,” Ms Hajar said. She explained to Channel NewsAsia that she saw the worker operating the forklift and so his operator's licence needed to be examined. “Sometimes they see us, they just disappear. We ask for the worker and the worker disappears but I have photo evidence. That’s why I took the photo first,” said Ms Hajar. Mr Lim accompanied the team to comb through the warehouse methodically, which took an hour. “We get the warehouse manager to guide us because they know the space best,” said Anderson Ng, 30, the team leader. Their initial impressions were “so far so good” and that Mr Lim had been cooperative. In Singapore, workplaces such as shipyards and factories that handle petroleum products or high-cost engineering works, or those with more than 100 workers are required to appoint a safety officer. Firms like the company that Mr Lim works for are not required to have one, and so employees may be unfamiliar with safety procedures and documents vital to at-risk workplaces. “When they make us wait, it means that there’s not a good system,” Ms Hajar said. For example, logs like the daily safety checklist for vehicles should be placed in the vehicle itself, she explained. During the inspection, the team found multiple issues – including using split wooden pallets to transport and store items, ladders used carelessly by workers, as well the very cluttered condition of the warehouse. Ultimately, what crossed the threshold for the safety inspectors were the damaged racks still being used. “Once you have damaged columns, the load is transferred from the beam to your columns to your foundation. It will reduce your safe working load. To how much? We don’t know. The assessor will only assess it when it is in working order but now it’s already damaged and twisted in some areas,” Mr Ng said. The supply company was slapped with a partial stop-work order (SWO) which will be lifted only after the pallets and damaged racks have been replaced and evaluated again by a safety inspector. MANAGING REACTIONS FROM HUMOUR TO HOSTILITY After being served an SWO, a company representative immediately protested the decision made by Ms Hajar’s team. “Huh! What do you mean? But we cannot not work. No sales how?,” he said tersely. Mr Ng stepped in and said that they are not stopping the work of the company. It could continue with operations and sales but will have to stop any more work on the affected racks and pallets. “What you can do now, you remove all the items on the damaged racks first because there is imminent danger that the racks may not be able to take the three tonnes. We are not stopping the operations like deliveries,” Mr Ng said, as he attempted to clear the air. The man's frustrated response is common, the team said, but it is something they can work with. “It’s always a two-way conversation between the inspectors and the occupier. We have to understand from them what are their needs and special operations before we can make any assessment on whether there were any contraventions,\" said Mr Ng. At another site - a shipping container yard along Penjuru Road - the officers met with a safety officer Rashad to carry out an inspection of the yard. At this site there were several safety issues, such as not having a designated walking path for pedestrians and allowing drivers to walk under containers that were being moved. Mr Rashad, the appointed safety officer from the occupier for the container yard, was knowledgeable about the inspectors' work and, at times, keen to make inject some humour into the process. 'You will see people like this trying to making a joke out of a serious situation but you have to be firm with what you are saying, what are the findings and what they have to rectify,\" said Ms Hajar.  \"You can ignore all the jokes and laugh it off but the more important things need to be addressed first,\" she added.  Ms Hajar has seen her fair share of occupiers who react to her presence at their workplace in a disdainful manner. She found it challenging to get occupiers, who tend to be much older than her, to take her seriously.  \"In the first few months ... I didn't have that level of confidence yet. Sometimes when you talk to occupiers, they might even undermine you,\" Ms Hajar said.  Some have even said that they have done things their way for a long time, and Ms Hajar is too young and lacks experience. She said she has learned to handle such occupiers by being firm and she will share stories of fatal injuries with such occupiers.  \"To me, the worst safety violation is not telling your workers about the violations,\" she said.  \"Going to the workplace is a proactive way of preventing accidents from happening. So when I go down and talk to the workers, it feels good. It's very fulfilling.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/patrolling-with-safety-inspectors-wsh-manpower-ministry-10636856"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 08:57PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Team Singapore", "swimming"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: China swimmers win medley relay gold with new Games record", "content": " JAKARTA: China swimmers won gold in the men's 4x100m medley relay on Friday (Aug 24), setting a new Asian Games record in the process.

Guangdong Governor Ma Xingrui and Singapore Education Minister Ong Ye Kung reaffirmed plans to upgrade the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City's (GKC) project status from a private sector-led project backed by the government to that of a state-level bilateral cooperation project on Friday (Aug 24), at the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council meeting and the Sino-Singapore Knowledge Forum. This was discussed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in April this year. \"I would say three big changes have happened, and that set the foundation for our further cooperation,\" said Mr Ong, who is also the co-chairman of the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council. \"Number one is our common conviction to raise Guangzhou Knowledge City into a state level project,\" he said. \"I think the path is clear, this will be done, and the importance of GKC will be so much higher.\" The knowledge city, which broke ground in July 2010, is designed to attract high-tech industries and creative talent. At that time, it was positioned as a new model for Sino-Singapore collaboration led by the private sector and backed by the governments. Since its establishment, GKC has registered more than 1,000 companies with a total registered capital of S$22 billion. When it is elevated to a state-level bilateral cooperation project, it will be the first of such projects between the two countries.  Channel NewsAsia understands the boost in its status could mean the project can benefit from state-level initiatives, including being piloted as a free trade zone. GKC could also serve as Singapore’s entry into the Greater Bay Area, China’s national strategy to link nine cities in the Guangdong Pearl River Delta Economic Zone with Hong Kong and Macau. This Greater Bay Area plan is seen by some as China's answer to Silicon Valley in the United States. “Now this project has been upgraded to a state-level project for both countries, and we can’t still think of it as just for Guangdong. We need to liberate our mindset and move with the times,\" said Mr Ma, who is also co-chairman of the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council. \"We need to figure out how can we further sharpen the position of the project. Our both sides will continue to study. But no matter how we position it, overall the project is moving in a positive direction.\" Speaking at the Sino-Singapore Knowledge Forum, Mr Ong also elaborated on the importance of remaining open and innovative. \"Currently protectionism is rearing its head,\" he said. \"We have Brexit, and we have the global economy slowing. This has brought about much uncertainty. \"Although the macro environment is not ideal, Singapore will maintain a free and open economy.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sino-singapore-guangzhou-knowledge-city-to-be-upgraded-to-state-10649550"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 07:55PM", "tags": ["Lazada", "start-up"], "author": "Eugenia Lim", "title": "Lazada partners Finaxar to offer financing for its merchants", "content": " SINGAPORE: Local merchants on online marketplace Lazada will be able to get working capital financing through Finaxar’s Merchant Credit Line (MCL).

In March this year, Ng Shiuh Shao, 24, was sentenced to two years' jail while his younger brother Ng Shiuh Leong, 23, received nine months for attacking Mr Tey Meng Seng, their mother's 42-year-old Malaysian ex-boyfriend. Their mother, Ms Cindy Lim Wan Chan, 45, got to know Mr Tey on Facebook and the couple dated, before breaking up sometime in December 2015. About a month after this, Mr Tey started dating another woman, Ms Leong Choi Kuen, whom he also got to know on Facebook. On March 28, 2016, the older Ng received a call from his mother, saying that she was going to meet Mr Tey. His mother, along with Ms Leong, wanted to check Mr Tey's phones as they suspected him of contacting other women. The two brothers, along with one of their friends known as Ashrin, took a taxi to meet their mother. That night, all four of them arrived at Mr Tey's rental unit. Ms Leong was also there, as she and Ms Lim intended to confront Mr Tey about his relationships with them, and also about financial issues. Meanwhile, the two brothers and Ashrin planned to attack Mr Tey when he returned home. As he entered the compound, the three men rushed towards him, hitting him with their fists while scolding Hokkien vulgarities. The older Ng and Ashrin took turns to hit him with a stool. The older brother also pointed a knife at the victim, asking him to hand over his two mobile phones. The three men and the two women left the scene after returning him his phones and personal documents. Mr Tey filed a police report the next day. He sustained multiple injuries, including bruises on his face and head, as well as a wrist fracture. He was warded in hospital, incurring more than S$1,400 in medical fees. Ashrin remains at large. TWO BROTHERS CALLED THEIR SENTENCES 'MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE' The two brothers were unrepresented in court. They had discharged their defence lawyers in April this year and engaged new ones, who later discharged themselves. The older Ng contended that the sentence was \"manifestly excessive\", and said the District Judge \"erred by failing to consider or sufficiently appreciate that there was an element of provocation by the victim\". He also claimed that the judge had erred in placing \"insufficient mitigating weight\" on his age, plea of guilt and compensation, and in finding that he was not truly remorseful for his actions. The younger Ng appealed on similar grounds. Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang disagreed that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. He said the older Ng's claim that he \"just wanted to stand up for their mother's honour\" was essentially vigilante justice, \"which has clearly no place in our society and must be discouraged\". Justice Aedit Abdullah dismissed the appeal, finding that the sentence meted out by the District Court was correct.  However, he allowed the older Ng to defer his sentence for eight weeks to spend time with his child, and gave his younger brother a deferment as well.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/high-court-dismisses-appeal-against-sentence-by-brothers-who-10649336"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 06:56PM", "tags": ["transport", "Malaysia", "high-speed rail"], "author": "", "title": "Discussion on Malaysia's request to defer HSR ongoing, says Singapore's Ministry of Transport", "content": " SINGAPORE: Discussions on Malaysia's request to defer construction of the High-Speed Rail are ongoing and the bilateral agreement pertaining to the project remains in force, Singapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Friday (Aug 24).

Abdul Rahim Ghazali, 46, faces 113 charges, including for cheating, receiving bribes and engaging in a conspiracy to cheat. He pleaded guilty to 25 charges, with the remainder to be taken into consideration for sentencing. Abdul Rahim worked for Frasers between 1998 and June 2017, starting out as a senior technician and eventually getting promoted to facilities supervisor. Based in Alexandra Point, one of the properties managed by Frasers, Abdul Rahim was tasked with maintaining the building and ensuring that day-to-day operations were carried out.  He also managed repair works in the building, sourcing and supervising the contractors who carried out the works. He could also award jobs to contractors on Frasers' approved vendor list. In 2011, Abdul Rahim decided to set up a company with an accomplice Loh Boon Wah, and use that company - Fatal Express Facility Services - to secure jobs from Frasers. Both men knew that Abdul Rahim would have to conceal his interest in Fatal in order to obtain jobs from Frasers, who would not have engaged Fatal if it had known of the connection. It was decided that Loh would be named as Fatal's director, while Abdul Rahim secured jobs from Frasers for Fatal. The pair would split the profits obtained. Their conspiracy saw Abdul Rahim award 112 Frasers contracts to Fatal between 2011 and 2017. Frasers paid Fatal S$89,570 for those contracts. ABDUL RAHIM ASKED FOR S$100 BRIBE IN 2016 In 2016, Abdul Rahim also asked a contractor performing sealant works at Alexandra Point for a S$100 bribe. The man, Ang Kim Woo, was installing glass panels in June 2016 on behalf of Loyal Specialist & Engineering, who had been contracted by Frasers. Abdul Rahim, who was supervising the man and his team, approached Ang and asked for some money. Ang agreed. Abdul Rahim knew that Ang had agreed so as to avoid any potential trouble when the accused supervised Loyal's works. Abdul Rahim also knew that Ang had agreed in the hope that the accused would appoint Loyal for more jobs from Frasers, the court documents said. Details were not provided on how the conspiracy and bribery were discovered. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ang Siok Chen had asked for a jail sentence of 12 months. She said that seven of the sentences should run consecutively, as the offences were committed over seven years.  Abdul Rahim's defence lawyer, Ms Emily Koh, asked for less than 12 months' jail, saying that her client was extremely remorseful. She said that he had cooperated fully with the police and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. Ms Koh also said that Abdul Rahim was the sole breadwinner of his family and had an ailing father who depended on him. \"He has also lost his job after 20 years with his previous employer as a result of his stupid, careless and wrongful deeds,\" said Ms Koh. Abdul Rahim can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for cheating. District Judge Marvin Bay adjourned the case for sentencing to next week. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/former-frasers-property-unit-employee-cheat-contracts-bribe-10648800"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 05:57PM", "tags": ["housing", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "", "title": "Home ownership helps Singaporeans build up assets: PM Lee", "content": " SINGAPORE: By pursuing homeownership as a key national policy, the Government has improved the lives of Singaporeans significantly, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech on Friday (Aug 24), following key announcements on housing policy at Sunday’s National Day Rally. \"The Government has long pursued home ownership as a key national policy, for many good reasons,\" he said as he launched a book - Critical Issues in Asset Building in Singapore’s Development. Owning their own homes gives Singaporeans \"a stake in the country\" and something to fight for when the \"chips are down\", said Mr Lee. \"It enables every Singaporean to share in our economic growth, because as the economy grows, so will the value of your home,\" he said. \"And nearly every household has a substantial asset to its name, even low-income households.\" This housing policy has helped the country avoid the extremes of poverty often seen in even affluent societies, he added. \"We could have left housing largely to the private market, like Hong Kong. We could have controlled rents, like in San Francisco; or we could have provided rental flats at subsidised rates to tenants,\" he said. \"But none of these alternatives would have achieved the same economic and social results as home ownership.\" Mr Lee had unveiled major housing policies at the National Day Rally on Sunday, including the Government’s plans to expand the Home Improvement Programme to newer flats, to upgrade every HDB flat twice in its lifespan and to take back Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats to redevelop old towns at a measured pace under the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme or VERS. He also explained at length why HDB flats have a 99-year lease at the rally.  \"We need to be fair to future generations …  After (99 years), the flat comes back to the state, the Government redevelops the land, and builds new flats for future generations. This is the only way to recycle the land,\" he had said. Responding to commentators who said that the 99-year lease is merely an extended rental, Mr Lee said: \"I find this argument, frankly, amazing.\" \"Many private properties are held on 99-year leases too, yet nobody argues that they are merely being rented,\" he said.  \"HDB lessees have all the rights over their flats that owners of such leasehold private properties have.\" INTANGIBLE ASSETS He also touched on how the Central Provident Fund has helped Singaporeans build up their assets, and said: \"Our asset-building approach emphasises individual work ethic and personal responsibility, supported by government policies and resources.\" Mr Lee added that the support of Singaporeans for these policies is one of the nation’s \"intangible assets\". The country's shared values and social norms such as intolerance for corruption and acceptance of National Service as a necessary sacrifice, underpin Singapore’s society and unity, he stressed. \"These intangibles hold us together as one people. They enable our society to solve problems and make progress in ways which are very difficult for others to emulate,\" he said. These intangible assets are discussed in the book co-edited by National University of Singapore associate professors Dr S Vasoo and Professor Bilveer Singh, Mr Lee added. \"It is important for academics in our universities and think tanks to study and debate issues that are of importance to Singapore,\" he said. \"It will help us to understand the issues better, come up with better solutions, see things in a fresh perspective, and move our debate, policy and outcomes forward.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/home-ownership-hdb-helps-singaporeans-build-assets-pm-lee-10648722"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 05:05PM", "tags": ["corruption", "CPIB", "China", "property"], "author": "", "title": "Chinese national jailed for corruption after turning condo unit into dormitory", "content": " SINGAPORE: A Chinese national who tried to bribe a Certis Cisco officer was sentenced to three weeks' jail on Wednesday (Aug 24).

The company, once a global commodity trader with ambitions to rival Glencore or Vitol, has shrunk to an Asian-centric business focused on coal and freight trading after it slashed hundreds of jobs and sold prized assets to cut debt. Noble, whose market value has been nearly wiped out from US$6 billion in February 2015, is expected to win the required simple majority of voters in attendance at the meeting, said multiple sources familiar with the matter. Equity owners include China Investment Corp and Abu Dhabi fund Goldilocks Investment. Noble did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the vote. Noble already has majority support from its creditors and the backing of 30 per cent of its shareholders such as founder Richard Elman, who stepped down as chairman last year. Under the debt-for-equity swap, it plans to halve its debt after surrendering 70 per cent of control to its senior creditors, mainly made up of hedge funds, while existing shareholders' stakes will dwindle to 20 per cent and its management would get 10 per cent. \"The expectation is for the restructuring to be passed as Noble needs a simple majority at the meeting,\" said Neel Gopalakrishnan, credit strategist at DBS Group. \"It would come as a big surprise if it doesn't come through.\" Noble's accounting came under scrutiny in February 2015 when a former employee, Arnaud Vagner, started to publish reports anonymously under the name of Iceberg Research, alleging Noble inflated the prices of derivative contracts the company held to appear more profitable. Noble has always stood by its accounts. As Noble's shares and bonds plunged after the allegations, the company lost its investment-grade rating, took billions of dollars in impairment losses and lost access to funding. It also changed its chief executive officers. Desperate to slash debt, Noble sold a string of assets but this was not enough to run a trading business where profit margins are tiny. It posted a record US$4.9 billion loss for 2018 and then defaulted on its debt in March. \"It's just impossible in commodity trading to operate with so high interest costs. It is what people are once again going to realize,\" Vagner told Reuters, referring to the restructured Noble. \"Is the new team more competent than the previous one? No: It's the same. The share price is down 99 per cent with this management,\" he said by email. Noble's restructuring plan gained ground in June 2018 after it won over a key shareholder with a sweetened offer. If Noble does not obtain shareholders' approval, it will seek to implement a similar restructuring to keep the firm as a going concern but that plan does not provide for shareholders to receive any equity in the new company. Analysts are still wary of the new company's prospects. \"While its current debt problems will be temporarily fixed post-restructuring, it will need ready access to trade financing which is critical to its business,\" said Brayan Lai, analyst at Bondcritic, who publishes on independent research platform Smartkarma.

The 13-year-old, who cannot be named due to a gag order, has a borderline IQ of 70. The accused, Zailany Mohamed, grew up in the same village as the victim's uncle. On the evening of Mar 20, 2016, the boy and his uncle went to a coffee shop in West Coast Road to meet Zailany. When they arrived, Zailany had already consumed several bottles of beer with another friend. They sat and talked for some time. The boy sat next to Zailany, who molested him under the table. The boy pushed his hand away. Sometime after 9pm, the boy's uncle decided to return home. He told his nephew that Zailany could send him home later. Zailany continued drinking with his other friend at the coffee shop until after 11pm, when his friend left. Zailany then told the boy that he would send him home. They stopped at a pavilion near an HDB flat shortly after midnight and sat on a bench. Zailany began talking to the victim about sex. He then molested and fellated the boy. After this, he kissed the boy and transferred semen from his mouth into the boy's. The victim spat the semen onto the floor. Zailany proceeded to make the boy penetrate him, before he penetrated the boy. SPOTTED BY TWO MEN WHO NOTIFIED OFF-DUTY SPF NSF Their acts did not go unnoticed. Two 20-year-old men, Mr Muhd Zulfadhli Zulkafli and Mr Muhd Azizi Razzali, saw Zailany and the boy behaving intimately at the pavilion. They called an off-duty Singapore Police Force national serviceman, Mr Nur Hafizan Putra Hadinan, who lived nearby, and told him that they had seen an elderly person and a young boy having sex in public. Mr Hafizan, 23, went down to meet the two witnesses and proceeded to see what was happening, before alerting the police. Zailany and the boy were still at the pavilion when the police officers arrived. The police observed that the boy tried to pull his shirt over his shorts, the court heard. When the police asked the boy to lift up his shirt, they saw that his shorts were unzipped and unbuttoned. The officers also noticed white liquid on the floor in front of the pair. ACCUSED WAS UNDER INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL: DEFENCE Zailany pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual exploitation of a child and two charges of sexual penetration of a minor on Friday. Two other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. His pro bono defence lawyer, Mr Periowsamy Otharam, said that Zailany - who is divorced and does not have any children - is homeless, even though he is employed as a logistics contractor.  Zailany, who was also recently diagnosed with vertigo, is \"extremely remorseful\" and regrets his actions, the lawyer said, adding that he is a \"simpleton and did not realise the gravity of his actions until his arrest\".

Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output grew 5.1 per cent. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, manufacturing output fell 1.7 per cent. The chemicals cluster was the only segment to strengthen last month, with output rising 7.4 per cent from 1.7 per cent in June. Output in the electronics cluster grew 5.4 per cent in July, slowing from the 7.9 per cent increase the previous month, on weaker demand for semiconductors, computer peripherals and consumer electronics. Biomedical manufacturing output rose 10.1 per cent, easing from the 13.1 per cent growth in June. Meanwhile, growth in the precision engineering segment slowed to 3.4 per cent in July from 4.3 per cent in June and while that in the transport engineering cluster eased to 9.6 per cent last month from 14.3 per cent in June. Output in the general manufacturing cluster fared the worst, falling 0.6 per cent after a growth of 0.3 per cent in June. Despite the slowdown in June and July, industrial production is still expanding at \"a robust 9.9 per cent year-on-year for the first seven months of this year\", noted Ms Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank. \"The headwind of course remains the possibility of an escalation in the US-Sino trade war, with potential spillovers into emerging markets, including Asia,\" Ms Ling added. UOB senior economist Alvin Liew also cautioned that \"potential negative spillovers\" from rising US-China trade tensions could impact Singapore’s manufacturers \"both in terms of a slowdown in export orders as well as business sentiments\". \"We maintain our view that Singapore’s manufacturing activity will turn softer in the subsequent months of 2H 2018,\" Mr Liew said, adding that the negative impact from US-China trade tensions will be felt more prominently next year.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-manufacturing-output-slows-for-second-month-in-july-10647894"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 01:04PM", "tags": ["Active Mobility Advisory Panel", "Ministry of Transport", "personal mobility devices"], "author": "", "title": "Panel proposes cutting speed limit for PMDs, making helmets compulsory for cyclists on roads", "content": " SINGAPORE: Users of mobility devices such as e-scooters will soon have to slow down when riding on footpaths, while cyclists on roads will have to wear helmets – if the Government accepts a proposal put forward by an advisory panel. Under six new recommendations submitted by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel on Friday (Aug 24), the speed limit for personal mobility devices (PMDs) on footpaths will be lowered from 15kmh to 10kmh. This will give riders more reaction time to prevent accidents and reduce the severity of injuries in the event of an accident, the panel said. In its report, the panel wrote that it has heard \"strong concerns\" from the public that 15kmh is too fast for footpaths, due to heavy pedestrian traffic on some paths and vulnerable path users like the elderly and children.   \"Some users expressed concern that a lower speed limit may dampen the uptake of active mobility,\" it said. \"However, given the significant increase in active mobility accidents, we are of the view that this lower speed limit is necessary at this point in time to improve safety on public paths.\" The panel also proposed making it mandatory for cyclists to wear helmets when travelling on roads. The rule will not apply to cyclists who are crossing the road as part of their journey on footpaths and cycling or shared paths, or those who are temporarily on the road to avoid an obstruction. \"On roads, cyclists travel alongside larger and faster vehicles, and are the most vulnerable users. In the event of an accident, wearing a protective helmet would reduce the impact and injuries suffered by the rider,\" it said. It also recommended making mandatory the practice of \"stop and look out for oncoming traffic\" at road crossings. This would \"improve the predictability of behaviours\" at crossings and reduce the risk of accidents, it said.  The panel said it decided against making third-party liability insurance mandatory for PMD users, as greater focus should be placed on the prevention of accidents. \"Nevertheless, the panel strongly encourages all frequent active mobility device users to purchase third-party liability insurance to protect themselves against claims made by a third party in the event of an accident,\" it said. The panel said existing avenues of seeking compensation should also be made more accessible to victims of PMD accidents, while educational efforts for both pedestrians and riders on the safe sharing of public paths and roads should be stepped up. Panel chairman Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said in a Facebook post on Friday that the regulations for PMDs are reviewed from time to time to ensure that they remain relevant. The latest round of recommendations came after a public consultation that received more than 6,000 responses, focus group discussions, feedback from about 100 participants in a study and \"various industry engagements\", he said.  In a separate statement, the Ministry of Transport said it has received the panel's recommendations.  \"MOT will study the recommendations and issue our response in due course,\" it added.  In February, the advisory panel recommended the mandatory registration of e-scooters to deter reckless riding. The Government subsequently took up the recommendation, and said that the registration regime will be implemented by the end of this year. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/e-scooters-e-bikes-speed-limit-cyclists-helmets-panel-10647696"}, {"datetime": "24 Aug 2018 12:25PM", "tags": ["China", "CapitaLand"], "author": "Linette Lim", "title": "14 Singapore companies sign agreements to collaborate with Guangdong companies", "content": " SINGAPORE: Fourteen Singapore companies, including Ascendas-Singbridge, YCH Group, CapitaLand and ComfortDelGro, signed agreements on Friday (Aug 24) to collaborate with Chinese companies in Guangdong province.  The agreements were witnessed by Singapore's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung and Guangdong governor Ma Xingrui, the co-chairmen of Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council, at the ninth meeting of the council.  Trade agency Enterprise Singapore said Guangdong offers new opportunities for Singapore companies in research and development, technology, smart cities development, transport and logistics, education, biomedical sciences and professional services.

The grade school student has been hoping to catch the attention of his hero and idol, Singapore’s Olympic champion Joseph Schooling. “I wanted to wave at him or take a picture,” said Tiger who, like many Indonesians, goes by only one name. But on Thursday night (Aug 23) after cheering Schooling on to his second gold medal at the 2018 Asian Games in the 50m butterfly, Tiger received a pleasant surprise. Upon spotting Tiger calling his name from the front railing of the stands above him, Schooling, who was still panting from the intense swim race, tossed Tiger his black swim cap, drawing applause from nearby journalists and spectators. Tiger promptly caught it and looked temporarily stunned. “I was speechless, it felt like a dream,” said Tiger. “After I realised what happened, I ran back to my seat and passed the cap to my mother. I didn’t want anyone to take it.” Tiger was among the hundreds of Indonesians who were cheering Schooling on during his two individual race wins - the 100m butterfly and 50m butterfly. Screams of “Schooling, Schooling” were unmistakable as the Singaporean touched the wall first both times. Mr Nuryaman, a 44-year-old Grab driver who brought his two children to watch Schooling win his 50m fly on Wednesday, told Channel NewsAsia that the Singaporean champion gave many Indonesians reason to cheer. “The swim races have so far been dominated by China and Japan. It's refreshing to see someone from this region - Southeast Asia - disrupting the supremacy,” he said. “We want our children to be inspired. He proves that nothing is impossible, even us Indonesians can one day achieve something at the global stage.\" Following his victory ceremony for the 50m butterfly - a race in which he won by 0.04s - Schooling paid tribute to the Indonesian fans for egging him on. “It was amazing. It’s unreal, the crowd support since I got here. It's always a pleasure and honour to hear a crowd cheer your name like that and cheer for you that intensely. #OneTeamSG’s Joseph Schooling pays tribute to Indonesian supporters who cheered him to gold in the #AsianGames 50m butterfly final https://t.co/LiZPOuSPPD pic.twitter.com/hD7DmseSj3  “So it almost feels like my home over here. It's a very, very nice feeling,” he said. Aspiring national swimmer 15-year-old Albertus Bangun was delighted when Schooling signed his swim jersey from the stands. “I didn’t even have to ask. We made eye contact and he immediately gestured to throw down the jersey and marker. What a star,” said Albertus. “I’m not going to ever wash this shirt. It's going to hang on my wall prominently so I can see it every day,” he said. Albertus, who like his idol is a butterfly specialist, recalled that Schooling had met Michael Phelps when he was a young boy, and he said that he wants to be similarly inspired and become an Olympic champion.  “I want to swim alongside Schooling, and race him one day. Like him, I want to make my country proud and win Indonesia’s first Olympic swimming gold,” he said.

The pair is hard at work preparing the restaurant’s signature madeleines, communicating occasionally using sign language, or by writing in Chinese on a paper pad. “Don’t be nervous,” pastry chef Mandy Pan writes at one point. Her mentee, 62-year-old Tay Lee Keng, responds with a smile and a thumbs up. Mdm Tay is deaf, and runs the bakery stall at Dignity Kitchen, a social enterprise and hawker training school for disabled and disadvantaged people. The skilled baker, who counts treats like muffins, pineapple tarts and large cookies as part of her repertoire, has to rely on visual cues such as a timer so she can check when her pastries are ready to be taken out of the oven. She is, nonetheless, passionate about baking. And her passion has brought her on a new adventure: She has just embarked on a training stint in the kitchens of db Bistro, one of Marina Bay Sands’ award-winning restaurants. Her skills will be put to the test on Friday (Aug 24) evening, where she will work together with her mentor, Chef Pan, in a food truck, preparing and serving food to members of the public. RAISING AWARENESS The stint is part of the integrated resort’s annual Sands for Singapore Charity Festival. Three Dignity Kitchen beneficiaries, Mdm Tay and stroke patients Roger Chong and Lau Liang Peng, were each attached to a Marina Bay Sands restaurant for three days to hone their skills and learn from a chef mentor, before they head out to work in the food trucks till Sunday (Aug 26). Proceeds from the sale will go to charity. The stint brings many benefits, explained Dignity Kitchen’s founder Koh Seng Choon. For one, the trainees are able to pick up new skills and experience that will stand them in good stead as they prepare for placements in food and beverage establishments outside of Dignity Kitchen.   “Hawker culture in Singapore is single-cuisine,” he said. “But in a restaurant like that, it’s multi-cuisine, and the environment is also completely different compared to a hawker centre.” Mdm Tay, in particular, hopes to learn to bake other items such as focaccia bread, brioche and fruit tarts.  “I can improve my baking skills when I go back from here,” she said through a sign language interpreter. “It prepares me with skills that outside bakeries need.”   Beyond this, Mr Koh also hopes that the opportunity will help raise awareness about the employability of people like Mdm Tay among companies. Dignity Kitchen, he explained, also helps to secure jobs for its beneficiaries, and he hopes that restaurants and other establishments can give them a chance. “There’s a shortage of people in the F&B industry, and I have the kind of people that they want,” he said. “So I hope that in this programme, we can show employers that they can work.” BAKING IS A “UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE” But were there any teething or communication issues at the start of the training? While Chef Pan, who is an executive pastry chef at db Bistro, admitted that she was a little worried about communicating with Mdm Tay at the start, it turned out that her fears were unfounded. “I was thinking back, and I realised that I’ve had similar experiences before,” she said, laughing. “When I was working in New York City, the guys in my team were either French or Mexican ... and I couldn’t speak either. “So it really isn’t much different.”   As Chef Pan demonstrated how she instructed Mdm Tay using hand gestures, she pointed out that it was, very simply, “a different way of showing someone how to do things”. “It’s not like we’re singing, where we have to learn through our voice,” she said. “Baking is special, because we learn through observation. “Your skills with your hands and your eyes are very important.” Describing Mdm Tay as a quick study and “full of energy”, she also had nothing but good things to say about her.  “When she first came in, she had a big smile on her face and you can tell she’s really happy to be here,” she said. “She’s trained in a hawker setting and we’re a celebrity chef restaurant, so the processes are slightly different. “But quite honestly, cooking and baking is a universal language, and if you can do it there, you can do it here.” It was just a few hours into the training stint, but it was clear that the pair have already built a rapport. “Chef Mandy is very kind, knowledgeable and ready to share,” said Mdm Tay, as Chef Pan put an arm around her and gave her a thumbs-up sign. Later, as the two posed for a photograph and signed the words “thank you” to each other, Mr Koh admitted to being very encouraged by what he has observed so far. He explained that while businesses – and bosses – are often more than happy to employ people with disabilities, getting coworkers to accept them can sometimes be a challenge. “I’m very chuffed about this whole thing,” he said. “I was so happy at how Chef Mandy and her colleagues treated Mdm Tay, and how well they could work together.” “Maybe it’s a positive sign that people are now more receptive to people with disabilities,” he added. “Because they can work. All they need is the platform and opportunity for them to do so.” The Sands for Singapore Charity Festival runs until Aug 26. Mdm Tay and other Dignity Kitchen beneficiaries will be running food trucks at Marina Bay Sands' Event Plaza.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dignity-kitchen-disabled-disadvantaged-cooks-showcase-skills-10638224"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 10:42PM", "tags": ["traffic accidents", "Malaysia", "Singapore Airlines", "transport"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore Airlines pilot dies after Kuala Lumpur motorbike accident", "content": " SINGAPORE: A Singapore Airlines (SIA) pilot died on Wednesday (Aug 22) after getting into a motorbike accident in Kuala Lumpur.

Clarence Tang Jia Ming, a Sammyboy Forum member, also admitted to possessing more than 2,100 obscene films. Most of the 31 charges he admitted to involved hiding a camera that had been disguised as a wall hook in the toilet of a Starbucks outlet at Holland Village between 2014 and 2015. The court heard that Tang chose the Starbucks outlet at Holland Village because of \"the high number of females aged between 18 and 25 years who were likely to use toilets\" there. Tang also installed a similar camera disguised as a wall hook in his own washroom, and subsequently recorded a video of a 22-year-old female friend taking a shower.  HE LEARNT HOW TO DO IT FROM FELLOW SAMMYBOY FORUM MEMBER Tang is the last of five men involved in the case to be sentenced. Four other Sammyboy Forum members have been sentenced to between six months' and three years' jail. Tang had learnt how to plant hidden cameras from fellow Sammyboy Forum member and co-accused Ong Yi Jie. Deputy Public Prosecutor Li Yihong noted that Tang was \"skilled in camera placement\", angling the camera so that it would clearly capture the faces of the women and their private parts.  The videos captured were of \"very high quality and resolution\" and in colour, the prosecutor said. In total, he recorded 73 obscene films in this fashion, with 68 of them taken at the unisex toilet of the Starbucks outlet at 255 Holland Avenue. The offences came to light in November 2016 after the Ministry of Education made a police report saying that it had received information that there were obscene videos of schoolgirls in toilets or changing rooms. These had been taken with hidden cameras and were circulating on Sammyboy Forum, Google Groups and file-sharing website Volafile. The police raided Tang's home that month and seized multiple items, including hard drives, tablets, cameras, a laptop, an iPhone and three cameras that could be controlled remotely. An analysis of the external hard disk drives revealed more than 4,900 sex-themed films, with more than 2,100 of them certified obscene by the Board of Film Censors. VOYEURISTIC VIDEO RING SET UP IN 2016 Police investigations identified a Google group known as SG Horizon Club, which was used to distribute secretly filmed videos of women and girls relieving themselves in public toilets or trying on clothes in changing rooms. The group was set up by Ali V P Mohamed, a 46-year-old unemployed man, who was jailed for two years and fined S$80,000 in January. Ali set up the group in late 2016 and publicised the group on Sammyboy Forum. At its peak, the group had about 200 members.  Tang was identified as one of those who had shared the videos, along with three other co-accused: Joel Chew Weichen, Shaun Lee and Ong Yi Jie. Tang, Ong and Lee also used Skype accounts to trade obscene material. Chew, a 27-year-old sales engineer, was sentenced to six months' jail in October last year, while 28-year-old fund accountant Lee received 11 months' jail in March. Ong, a 27-year-old customer service officer, was sentenced to three years' jail in February. The case has been adjourned for a Newton hearing in January next year as the prosecution and defence have differing views on whether Tang was suffering from any psychiatric disorder at the time of the offences.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/voyeuristic-video-ring-camera-starbucks-toilet-sammyboy-10644584"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 05:34PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Johor Bahru", "RTS", "High-Speed Rail"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore, Malaysia look forward to bringing RTS link project to fruition: MOT", "content": " SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and his Malaysian counterpart Anthony Loke met in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday (Aug 23) where they discussed \"a broad range of transport issues\", said Singapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT).  These include the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) link project and the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) Tebrau shuttle service. \"The ministers look forward to strengthening transport collaboration, and to bring the RTS link project to fruition, which will ease congestion at our existing land checkpoints,\" said an MOT spokesperson.  The RTS link, which could reduce congestion on the Causeway by up to 15 per cent, was meant to be completed by 2024.

The new Model Factory at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) located at Clean Tech Loop - spanning 15,000 sq ft - lets companies test more than 10 types of advanced manufacturing technologies. They include virtual labs and simulation equipment for firms to test new production lines and improve resource planning even before implementing them.  The first of the two model factories was launched at Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) in October last year and is primarily aimed at companies on their first mile of technology adoption. Different from the one at SIMTech, the model factory at ARTC is targeted at companies in more advanced stages of technology adoption, with a more comprehensive suite of solutions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ​​​​​​​ Firms can also tap on ARTC’s pool of engineers and researchers to come up with solutions for their business.  Other types of technologies on offer include robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Speaking at the launch, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon said he hopes the facility will help support homegrown companies, especially the small- and medium-sized ones, to innovate, grow and scale up.  This is to ensure that the manufacturing sector is able to reap the benefits of digital technologies, Dr Koh added. “Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plan, the government has committed S$3.2 billion from 2016 to 2020, to develop research and technological capabilities in the Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) domain. “Disruptive technologies such as additive manufacturing, robotics ... are ushering a new era of manufacturing ... these technologies will fundamentally change the way businesses operate, produce and interact with their customers and supply chain, leading to enhanced business models,” he said.  Local metal and machine servicing firm Abrasive Engineering, which is one of the first to come on board the initiative, said the facility has helped with the test-bedding of a new type of digital process to monitor machine health.  The company is now in the process of integrating the technology in its machines, and expects to increase its sales by 20 per cent this year, revealed Mr Tan Ser Hean, Abrasive Engineering’s managing director. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-a-star-facility-to-boost-tech-access-in-manufacturing-sector-10644052"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 01:14PM", "tags": ["inflation", "Singapore economy", "CPI"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore's July core inflation highest in nearly four years", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore's core consumer price index (CPI) rose at its fastest pace in nearly four years in July in year-on-year terms, due to higher electricity and gas costs, data showed on Thursday (Aug 23). Core CPI in July rose 1.9 per cent from a year earlier, faster than the 1.7 per cent rise in the previous month. The median forecast in a Reuters poll was also for a 1.7 per cent rise. This is the highest since August 2014, when core inflation rose to 2 per cent from the year earlier. \"This reflects an upward revision in electricity tariffs in July following the pickup in global oil prices in the preceding quarter,\" the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a press release. The cost of electricity and gas surged 12.7 per cent in July from the year earlier. In June, it rose 3.7 per cent. Singapore's headline CPI, however, rose 0.6 per cent in July from a year earlier, in line with June's increase and slightly lower than the median forecast in a Reuters poll which called for a 0.7 per cent rise.   In July, food inflation came in at 1.5 per cent, unchanged from the previous month. Services inflation moderated to 1.5 per cent from 1.7 per cent in June. This was on account of smaller year-ago increases in the cost of education and healthcare services, as well as airfares and domestic services fees. Private road transport costs fell 0.2 per cent, reversing the 0.4 per cent increase in June. This was due to a steeper year-ago drop in car prices alongside a decline in Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums, they added. Accommodation costs slid 3 per cent in July - the same rate as in June. The pace of decline in housing rentals moderated, but the effect was offset by a smaller year-ago increase in the cost of housing maintenance and repairs. INFLATION LIKELY TO RISE GRADUALLY: MAS Looking ahead, MAS and MTI said they expect imported inflation to rise mildly, due in part to the rally in global oil prices as well as an expected increase in global food commodity prices. Domestic sources of inflation are also expected to increase alongside a faster pace of wage growth and a pickup in domestic demand. “However, the extent of consumer price increases will remain moderate, as retail rents have stayed relatively subdued and firms’ pricing power may be constrained by market competition,” they said. For the full year, MAS expects core inflation to rise gradually over the remaining months to average in the upper half of the 1 to 2 per cent forecast range. Similarly, headline inflation is projected to come within the upper half of the 0 to 1 per cent forecast range for the full year. \"With Brent crude oil prices moving higher, the risk is biased towards higher, rather than lower, inflationary environment in Singapore in the months ahead,\" said UOB economist Francis Tan. \"Cost-push type of inflation - rather than a demand-pull type of inflation - due to higher international oil prices will only mean lower purchasing power for Singaporeans,\" he added. Dr Tan Khay Boon, senior lecturer at SIM Global Education, added that while overall inflation is edging upwards marginally and is not alarming at this stage, there are concerns that healthcare and education costs are rising, making them less affordable for lower-income households.  \"The higher core inflation relative to headline inflation also means that inflation pressure is increasingly real to households, and this has arisen from higher costs in utilities and transport which are in turn due to higher food and oil prices,\" he added. Meanwhile, UOB's Mr Tan said that with MAS keeping its inflation expectations unchanged and ongoing trade concerns potentially slowing down global economic growth in the months ahead, the central bank is likely to remain cautious and maintain its current monetary policy stance.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-inflation-july-consumer-price-index-highest-4-years-10643866"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 01:12PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "fencing"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: Singapore women's foil team clinch bronze ", "content": " JAKARTA: Singapore’s women's foil team secured the country’s first fencing medal at the 2018 Asian Games on Thursday (Aug 23) after beating Chinese Taipei in the quarter-finals.  The team - which comprised of Amita Berthier, Maxine Wong, Tatiana Wong and Melanie Huang - defeated Chinese Taipei 45-19 to clinch a joint bronze medal as there is no playoff for third and fourth place. However, the team lost to China 14-45 in the semi-final on Thursday afternoon, denying them the chance to battle for a gold medal.  The quartet were outmatched by their Chinese opponents, who are each ranked at least 85 places higher in the world senior rankings.  The Singapore team’s medal in Jakarta is country's second ever fencing medal at an Asian Games after Lim Wei Wen bagged the bronze in the men’s epee event in Incheon in 2014. It is also Singapore's first women's fencing medal ever at the Asian Games.  Speaking to the media after the defeat to China, Amita, 17, said the experience in Jakarta \"has been amazing\", both for her individually and as a team.

If his body was fatigued, it did not show as he stormed off the blocks to finish as the fastest overall qualifier, clocking 23.84s.  Schooling's national teammate Teong Tzen Wei clocked 24.28s to finish ninth, just one place off a final spot.  On his own performance in the heats, Schooling said: \"It was okay. It's always hard to get up in the morning especially after a very very very long few days but the most important thing is booking a spot in the final which I'm looking forward to. It'll be fun.\"  Schooling said he had a \"rough\" night, heading to bed only at 1am and had to wake up at around 6am to prepare for the heats.   \"It's a shitty turn around but that's what you gotta do sometimes. It's a normal scenario at this kind of meet. I had a massage, a shower, and took a lot of caffeine last night. \"I had four cups of coffee in the evening so it was hard to go to bed, but it's okay, the whole point of prelims was to make finals and that's what I did so it's alright,\" he added.  However, in spite of all the challenges, Schooling stressed that he has prepared himself for these kind of situations.  \"It has been a long few days so of course I feel tired but it just means you got to grind through it.

Waduge Buddhika Upashantha Fernando, a 38-year-old Singaporean of Sri Lankan descent, is married with three children and lives in a flat in Kim Keat Avenue. The victim was a 28-year-old Malaysian working in Singapore as a cook. He cannot be identified due to a gag order.  On the day of the assault in November last year, he had been a tenant at the flat for about four months, the court heard. His usual routine meant that he left the flat at 9am and returned only at 11pm, and he had little interaction with Fernando and his family. At about 11.30pm on Nov 10 last year, the victim returned to the flat and had a shower. He then went to his room, closing the door and going to bed at about 1am. About two hours later, Fernando returned home from work. He was on his way out to buy vegetables when he \"felt the urge to engage in homosexual activity\", court documents said. He knew that his tenant was sleeping, and entered his room where the victim was asleep in a pair of shorts. Fernando then knelt on the floor, removed the victim's shorts and performed a sexual act on him. After about 10 minutes, the victim woke up and realised what was happening. He also felt Fernando rubbing against his shin. Instinctively, he yelled and kicked at Fernando, who left the room and the flat. The victim was shocked and did not know how to react. Within the hour, he sent a message to the police hotline asking for assistance. Fernando pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual assault by penetration. ACCUSED VIOLATED VICTIM IN THE MOST INTIMATE OF WAYS: PROSECUTION Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim called Fernando's conduct \"shocking\", asking for at least six years' jail and three strokes of the cane.  He said that \"sexual intimacy involving penetration by or of sexual organs is the closest form of physical human intimacy that may be enjoyed between two individuals\". \"Because of the intimate nature of contact, parties must consent to engaging in sexual intimacy. In cases where one party has not consented, he or she is also violated in the most intimate of ways,\" said the prosecutor, adding that this is made worse when the violation takes place in the home, where a person can expect to be safe. Fernando's defence counsel had asked for a custodial term of five years' jail, which the prosecutor called \"wholly inadequate\". District Judge Kessler Soh sentenced him to six years' jail and three strokes of the cane. He could have been jailed for up to 20 years, fined or caned. Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story based on court documents said the prosecutor had requested eight years’ jail and four strokes of the cane. The Attorney-General’s Chambers has clarified that the prosecutor asked for six years’ jail and three strokes of the cane.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/married-man-sexually-assaulted-male-tenant-10643358"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 10:59AM", "tags": ["crime", "Singapore Police Force", "Carousell"], "author": "", "title": "Carousell e-commerce scams jump 136% in first half of 2018: Police", "content": " SINGAPORE: The number of e-commerce scams on online marketplace app Carousell jumped a whopping 136 per cent in the first half of this year, the Singapore police said on Thursday (Aug 23). A total of 1,020 cases of people being scammed on Carousell were reported between January and June, up from 432 in the same period last year. Eighty per cent of all e-commerce scams reported took place on Carousell, with common transactions involving electronic items, as well as tickets to events and attractions, particularly Universal Studios Singapore. Overall, e-commerce scam cases jumped 58 per cent from 808 cases last year to 1,277 cases in the first half of this year. The total amount cheated also went up by 43.1 per cent, from S$650,000 to S$930,000. The largest amount cheated in a single case was about S$50,000. Overall crime increased by 3.2 per cent in the first six months of the year due to the rise of such e-commerce cases, as well as scams to do with loans and the impersonation of China officials, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF).  The number of criminal cases went up to 16,460 from 15,949. During this time, the number of e-commerce, loan and China officials impersonation scams also went up by 72.8 per cent, from 1,055 to 1,823 cases.  The SPF attributed the rise in online crime to pervasive Internet penetration and the greater prevalence of smartphones among Singaporeans.  \"Online crimes are particularly challenging to solve because of the borderless nature of the Internet,\" said SPF. \"A significant proportion of online commercial crimes are committed remotely by foreign syndicates that are hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet. These criminals will continue to find ways to exploit and prey on the vulnerabilities of potential victims.\" Police said they will continue to educate the public on such scams, with a particular focus on the online community. SPF also said that it \"welcomed\" Carousell's introduction of its escrow payment system, CarouPay, in June this year.  \"Buyers using CarouPay are protected from e-commerce scams as the payment will only be released to the sellers after the buyers have acknowledged the satisfactory receipt of the items purchased,\" it said, adding that customers are encouraged to make use of such systems when they transact online.  INTERNET LOVE SCAMS DOWN FOR FIRST TIME IN 5 YEARS For the first time in five years, the number of Internet love scam cases fell, registering an 18.6 per cent drop from 344 to 280 cases.  The total amount cheated fell to around S$12 million, compared to S$22 million in the same period last year.  SPF attributed the decline to the formation of a task force to investigate scams involving foreign crime syndicates.  \"Since its formation on Oct 1, 2017, the Transnational Commercial Crime Task Force has seized more than S$1.1 million and closed more than 400 bank accounts belonging to money mules who were involved in Internet love scams,\" said SPF.  The police also said they are working with remittance agencies and banks to train their frontline staff to detect customers who may be victims of a scam.  \"The heightened awareness and vigilance in the trained staff have resulted in several successful interventions,\" said police. In March this year, an OCBC customer requested to remit S$2,500 to pay a customs clearance fee for a parcel stuck at the Malaysian customs. Two of the bank's employees convinced the victim that it was a love scam and stopped the remittance.  OUTRAGE OF MODESTY AT NIGHTSPOTS, PUBLIC TRANSPORT The number of outrage of modesty cases went up 21.5 per cent from 685 cases to 832 cases, with police highlighting instances at public entertainment nightspots and public transport as \"key concerns\".  There were 63 cases of outrage of modesty at nightspots in the first half of this year, compared to 46 in the same period last year. There was also a 43.8 per cent rise in outrage of modesty cases on public transport, from 73 to 105.  \"The police will continue to educate the public to be vigilant against outrage of modesty, and advise victims of molestation to make a police report as soon as possible. Reporting the crime early is crucial to help the police identify and arrest the perpetrator,\" SPF said.  The police will work with public entertainment outlets in Clarke Quay on a Smart Clubbing Campaign later this year. The campaign will focus on creating awareness of crimes commonly committed against nightspot patrons, crime prevention measures and how to respond should one witness or is a victim of a crime.  There will be glow-in-the-dark crime advisories on display, as well as \"smart clubber\" crime prevention videos screened to remind patrons to remain vigilant against crime, authorities added.  Meanwhile, Citizens on Patrol (COP) volunteers with the Queenstown Neighbourhood Police Centre have expanded their patrol to include Queenstown MRT station and will be disseminating crime prevention messages.  Police said the patrol initiative will be extended to other COP groups.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-police-crime-rate-increase-june-2018-10642916"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 09:51AM", "tags": ["Joseph Schooling", "Asian Games"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "After Asian Games gold, Schooling says he's back on track for Tokyo 2020", "content": " JAKARTA: Singapore Olympic champion swimmer Joseph Schooling swam a total of three races at the 2018 Asian Games on Wednesday (Aug 22) - featuring in the heats and finals for the 100m butterfly as well as the 4x100m freestyle final.  That's three different warm ups and cool downs, and 300m of pulsating sprint racing at the Gelora Bung Karno aquatic centre in Jakarta - all within a span of 12 hours.  The effort was all worth it for the 23-year-old, who ended the day successfully defending his gold medal in his pet event and helping Singapore to a bronze in the relay race.  He looked understandably drained when he spoke to reporters at the end of it all, talking about how his preparation bore fruit and if the effort was finally able to silence his relentless critics.  But when a journalist asked whether he was feeling pressure for the 50m butterfly event on Thursday morning, his eyes lit up. \"Pressure? No, I'll enjoy it. I swam two 100s today (in the final) so that's (three) 100s. Two more 50s is nothing in my mind so that's ok. I'm very excited, I'll probably sleep a lot easier tonight,\" he said.  Since his historic Olympic win in Rio de Janiero in 2016, Schooling's career - by his own admission - has not been smooth sailing. At the FINA World Championships in 2017, Schooling had to settle for bronze in the 100m butterfly final, and could only watch as United States' Caeleb Dressel stole the limelight.  \"I’ve been up and down over the last two years but its always a cycle right? You cant always be in tip-top performance. What's important is if you're not feeling at your best, step up, grind it through and ... try to win the race. That's what defines a champion,\" said Schooling.  When asked if he feels he is now back to his best, Schooling respectfully declined to make that admission. His time for the 100m fly in Jakarta was after all 0.65s off his personal best, set in Rio in 2016.  \"I'm heading in the right direction. I've had a lot of things to get used to ... and since turning pro it's been a little different, but I'm definitely going in the right direction,\" he said.  \"My support staff is amazing, I'm starting to feel more and more comfortable so I envision the next two years, getting better and better heading into (South) Korea and Tokyo,\" he said.  As far as the 100m butterfly is concerned, next on his agenda is the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in South Korea, and more importantly, to defend his Olympic title at Tokyo 2020.  \"(The Asian Games gold) is just another stepping stone ... you build one at each meet until you finally get to the Olympics. This is one of the building years to get to do what I want to do in Tokyo. \"And so are things going according to plan? Yes I'd say so. I'm happy with where I'm at. I'm definitely in a lot better shape than I was last year, hopefully I can keep building on that,\" he said.  Schooling was criticised by certain quarters for his dip in form since 2016, and his win in Jakarta could go some way in proving them wrong. But for Schooling, it is about how he channels it to boost his performance.  \"I think criticism is good, like if everyone’s on your side praising you then it might get to your head. But I think this is a great check and balance for me, (I've) always proven my critics wrong. It's gives me more motivation to go to practice to race harder so I can prove people wrong,\" he said.  In the lead up to Tokyo, Schooling said he is eyeing to compete in the US professional swim circuits, the Mare Nostrum and even feature in meets around Europe.  \"Now after I'm done with school, finally, it'll be nice to go out to Europe and swim in some meets. I'll come back for the FINA World Cup in Singapore and take it meet by meet and see what happens.\" But for now, Schooling is just focused on two more days of racing in Jakarta. Next on his plate is the 50m butterfly, an event he bagged silver in the last Asian Games in Incheon. But Schooling is looking to better that, and clinch his second gold for the Games in Indonesia.  \"It's one of my goals ... to give everyone the chance to hear our national anthem. So having done that, I feel very proud and very happy. Mission accomplished for today. But I still have two more days of racing. (The 50m butterfly) is a big event which I'm excited about,\" he said.  Schooling won 3 medals in the previous edition of the Asian Games in Incheon - a gold, a silver and a bronze.

On Monday, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said it has recalled a batch of Dumex Mamil Gold infant milk formula – Step 1 (850g) after the Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria was found in samples of the product. Twelve babies were fed the milk formula at KKH, the hospital confirmed on Thursday (Aug 23), while one was at NUH. KKH had earlier said that 13 babies were given the affected formula, but revised its numbers in an update. The 12 infants are \"reported to be well\", the chairman of KKH's medical board said in response to Channel NewsAsia's queries.  \"KKH is closely monitoring the situation. Our team of medical specialists is on standby to provide care and support where necessary,\" said Associate Professor Ng Kee Chong.  He said the hospital has removed all tins of the implicated batch of products, and has since stopped using this brand of milk powder. \"Our top priority is the health of the babies. Should they have symptoms such as fever, poor feeding or lethargy, or if the infant feels unwell, parents and caregivers should immediately consult a doctor,\" Assoc Prof Ng added.  NUH said one infant might have been fed the recalled milk and the father has been advised to monitor his child’s condition and seek treatment if there are symptoms. \"To date, we have not received any reports of our NUH young patients experiencing any symptoms related to this recalled product,\" it said. Like KKH, NUH said it has removed the affected products from its hospital.  Cronobacter infections are generally rare, but they can be fatal to newborns as they may cause meningitis or sepsis. The affected batch, which was made in Malaysia, has an expiry date of Sep 11, 2019. The batch number is 09117R1. The Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the milk had been used at KKH and NUH.  The ministry also said that babies who might have been given the affected milk were those below six months old, and who were admitted to the two hospitals between Aug 1 and Aug 20. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dumex-mamil-milk-formula-recalled-babies-kkh-nuh-10642862"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 08:40AM", "tags": ["Crazy Rich Asians", "Singapore", "Kevin Kwan", "Jon Chu", "Entertainment", "Hollywood"], "author": "", "title": "Success of Crazy Rich Asians movie sparks plans for sequel", "content": " LOS ANGELES: The Warner Bros movie studio is in the early stages of developing a sequel to its groundbreaking romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday (Aug 22). It is unclear when a sequel could reach theatres. No script has been written and no deals have yet been signed with the movie's screenwriters, the source said. Jon M Chu plans to return to direct the new film, his publicist confirmed. But he is first scheduled to direct an adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical In the Heights, which is scheduled for release in June 2020. The Hollywood Reporter first reported plans for a sequel. The trade publication said the next instalment would be based on author Kevin Kwan's second book in a trilogy, China Rich Girlfriend. Crazy Rich Asians marked a milestone as the first film from a major Hollywood studio in 25 years to feature an all-ethnic Asian ensemble cast. It stars Constance Wu, Michelle Yeoh, Awkwafina and newcomer Henry Golding. On its debut weekend, the movie topped US and Canadian box offices with US$26.5 million in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday, and sales had topped US$44 million through Tuesday. The movie is now starting to roll out in theatres around the world. In the film, Wu plays a New York economics professor who flies to Singapore to meet her boyfriend's family only to discover it is one of the wealthiest in the country. The cast was drawn from Taiwan, Britain, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United States and Australia, along with Singapore. The main cast also is expected to return for the sequel, The Hollywood Reporter said. The new film also will tell the story of Astrid, the cousin of Golding's character, Nick, with a man named Charlie played by Glee alum Harry Shum Jr., Chu told the trade publication. The gold-digging character in Crazy Rich Asians, Kitty Pong, portrayed by Fiona Xie, will also have a bigger role, Chu said. \"We needed to hire somebody who can really act, because in time she becomes much more significant,\" he said. The plans for a sequel emerged as Singapore's defence ministry said that author Kwan, also an executive producer on the Crazy Rich Asians film, is wanted for defaulting on his compulsory military service. Kwan could not be reached for comment.

In recent weeks we have seen the much publicised SingHealth Data breach, the ransomware attack on Chinese shipping giant Cosco, and the crippling of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer TSMC by a virus.  Most organisations are conscious of the significant malicious cyber traffic seen in Asia, but often discount the risks and wonder:  Why would anyone attack me? Most don’t consider the broader context in which these attacks occur and the collateral damage that is common. It has been suggested that the target of the SingHealth attack was Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s medical data, but hackers are not known to differentiate when extracting other sensitive information, hence the exfiltration of data pertaining to 1.5 million SingHealth patients.  If the attack was state-sponsored then it serves as a useful reminder that exposure to cyber risk does not exist in a vacuum. Geopolitical tension has been the driver behind some of the more significant attacks in recent memory.  That organisations may be collateral damage should not be discounted. In the case of TSMC, which was shut down by a latent variant of the WannaCry malware, the impact of non-targeted attacks is evident. The most significant cyber losses of 2017 belonged to those companies caught in the web of WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware. WE NEED AN ‘ASSUME BREACH’ MENTALITY Acceptance of such risks is critical, but there’s no turning back from the reliance on data, automation and connectivity that gave rise to the risk. Indeed, organisations which have fallen victim to cyber losses have turned to technology to mitigate the damage.   Integrated transport and logistics company, Maersk, and Cosco used a combination of social media and personal email accounts to keep their businesses running – not the most secure measures, but business continuity is often paramount. SingHealth communicated with affected parties by SMS.  But there is one way to get ahead of the curve. Public comments from government officials in Singapore suggest an acceptance that while every effort must be taken to secure data, attacks will be ongoing and breaches are inevitable.  Indeed, there is a growing acceptance that cyber risk is an unavoidable cost of doing business – a necessary consequence of the benefits derived from technology. This was also clear in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s Facebook statement where he says: We cannot go back to paper records and files. We have to go forward, to build a secure and smart nation. The logical extension of this acceptance is a shift towards an “assume breach” mentality for organisations, an approach to cybersecurity that recognises the inevitability of some degree of intrusion, and emphasises incident response and protection of critical assets once the perimeter is compromised.  RED-TEAMING STRENGTHENS SYSTEMS But this approach depends on a willingness among the broader public to forgive organisations which have been successfully attacked, as well as to be far more critical of those who have mishandled communications or failed to act prudently after a breach has occurred.  Adopting this mentality does not mean that organisations sacrifice cybersecurity measures because it will educate how those measures are deployed.  Sophisticated organisations will often engage ethical hackers for “red-team testing” – launching attacks on their systems to detect vulnerabilities. Good red teams have an incredibly high penetration rate, but this is only part of the story.  Once breach is assumed, the more important questions emerge – can attackers move within our systems to access sensitive data? Are internal access controls appropriate? How quickly did our own security team detect the intrusion? Similarly, organisations which adopt an “assume breach” mentality are more likely to have an incident response plan which has been tested and can be readily deployed in a crisis.   A RESPONSE PLAN NEEDED In underwriting an organisation, cyber insurers will want to see that an incident response plan is in place, but the best risks will have a plan that is regularly tested and updated. Table-top simulations of cyber events can help senior management understand the pressures and responsibilities of handling a crisis and aid companies to identify gaps in incident response and business continuity plans.  These exercises also focus on communication with clients, employees, commercial partners and regulators. But quick and clear communication with stakeholders in the wake of a cyber event is not common for businesses in other parts of Asia, particularly as most jurisdictions do not feature mandatory breach notification laws, in stark contrast to the experience in Singapore (where mandatory breach notification amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act are pending), the US, Europe and Australia.  That is expected to change in the coming years, but companies are also recognising that controlling the message can be best practice.   Perceptions of honesty and transparency are two key drivers of successful recovery from a reputation event, according to the 2018 Reputation Risk in the Cyber Age study released by Pentland Analytics and Aon.  Both SingHealth and TSMC communicated with the media quickly and may have avoided reputational damage that may arise from speculation and unanswered questions.  Ultimately, companies that are confident with the efforts they have made to bolster cyber resilience and have prepared for these events with an assume breach mentality will be much better placed to face the media, clients and their shareholders.  Andrew Mahony is regional director of Financial Services and Professions at leading professional services and risk management firm Aon Asia.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/best-way-to-deal-with-breaches-cyber-attacks-hackers-10634022"}, {"datetime": "23 Aug 2018 06:00AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Heritage"], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "‘I’m afraid one day it’s going to go’: Saving Singapore’s old buildings one photograph at a time", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos  SINGAPORE: Since 2006, photographer Darren Soh has been making regular visits to a certain HDB block in the western side of Singapore. There’s nothing fancy about 82 Commonwealth Close but the 42-year-old keeps taking photos of it again and again. “It’s where I lived from when I was born until the age of five. It was built in 1963 and sits on top of a hill with two other blocks. The view is amazing,” he told CNA Lifestyle.  “Every time I get a new camera, I would go there and take the same picture. I keep going because I’m afraid, one day, they’ll just announce that it’s going to go.” Soh’s childhood home is part of a wall montage of 48 HDB block facades he has taken over the years, which is currently found at the farthest end of the room at the Objectifs gallery. Seen in its entirety, it’s a mesmerising image of grids and angles that blend into each other anonymously – until he begins singling them out. “This one at Havelock Road was built in '67; this is from Redhill, also '67. This is from Commonwealth Drive, that’s from Geylang Lorong 3,” he said before pausing. “Both have been demolished. Then, he pointed to yet another image, which vaguely looked familiar. “This is Rochor Centre. If you step outside, you can see it being torn down.” TALKING ABOUT BUILDINGS The montage is part of Soh’s latest exhibition, Before It All Goes, which features photographs of buildings built during Singapore’s early independence years from the 1960s and 1970s. It’s not just HDB facades. The show also features eight iconic sites, both commercial and public structures, many of which have been in the news recently. Aside from Rochor Centre, there are also photos of Pearl Bank Apartments, People’s Park Complex, Golden Mile Complex, Golden Mile Tower, Queenstown Cinema, Tanglin Halt Estate, and the swimming complexes in Bedok and Buona Vista. Like the housing buildings, some of these landmarks are gone while the fate of others are up in the air. And Soh – who has also released a book and a collaborative documentary – hopes his images will help get people talking about them. “There are 7,000 conserved buildings in Singapore but the fact remains that only 15 of them were built after Independence. We have lots of conserved buildings from the early 20th century, but the message I get is that everything that came after 1965 are not so important,” he said. “We need to talk about this whole idea of urban renewal and whether there’s another way out, rather than just keep demolishing and building new ones. If some of them can be saved because of more conversations, that would be great.” TANGLIN HALT AND QUEENSTOWN CINEMA A professional lensman for the past two decades, Soh’s love of architectural photography began in 2006, when he was commissioned to do a series on Marina Bay for international magazine Monocle. Following the transformation of the site into the future Marina Bay Sands made him realise the value of taking these photos. On the side, Soh began his personal project of simply documenting Singapore’s old buildings. But, he said, things took a slightly more serious turn a few years ago. In 2013, Queenstown Cinema was demolished and, a year later, came news that Tanglin Halt Estate was to be torn down under HDB’s Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). “It was the largest SERS project to date. The government had never announced the demolition of 31 blocks at one go. It was a really large estate and for them to just move everybody, it was like, ‘really?’. The decision-making felt very unilateral,” he said. The two developments prompted him to hasten his documentation process – especially when it came to residential buildings. “I would rapidly go and photograph places that are going en bloc, no matter how insipid they may appear. I also keep telling my friends to let me know when their condos are going en bloc so I can go photograph them,” he said. Soh would also scour the newspapers for any en bloc announcements and surf property websites and old HDB annual reports for more information on buildings. THE SUCCESS OF DAKOTA CRESCENT Soh acknowledges how complicated things are. It’s a tangled web of issues, he said, from the heritage standpoint to commercial considerations, issues of space and people’s investments. Reacting to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s recent National Day Rally speech, where the situation at Tanglin Halt was brought up, Soh said: “He actually gave a very good context to why this is going – that it was built at a time when land use was not optimal so it has to go. I think, in a way, I don’t think he could’ve offered much more in light of what’s already in motion.” He added: “It may not be our problem now but by the time it gets to our kids, everything will be erased. My son is six years old. By the time he gets married or have children, (Tanglin Halt) will be a memory. And while you are given new, taller, more modern flats to live in, it’s a very sobering thought that there’s no physical remnant left (of the old flats).” But if you’re into saving old buildings, all isn’t completely lost. Soh cited Dakota Crescent as one example of a success story. “Six of the blocks have been conserved and to me that’s a really big win because it’s unprecedented. There has never been a case before where the government says ‘we’re gonna demolish this’, a bunch of people came to say ‘can you please not?’ and they changed their mind,” he said. “And also, because the MP in the area, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, believed in saving part of it and actively spoke in Parliament.” YOUR INSTAGRAM PHOTO HELPS Of course, Soh said he has no illusions that mere photographs would change things just like that. But for him, every single image of these buildings are important – including those you find on Instagram. “Somehow, many Instagrammers go to a lot of these places. They may be there just because of aesthetics but the fact remains these pictures exist and are part of an archive. I see that as something good,” he said. Whatever fate befalls post-Independence buildings, Soh said he’ll continue shooting whatever is there – even if the HDB block doesn’t look special, like his childhood home. “It looks the same to you and I, but someone who has lived there will be able to tell. As long as the images are special to even just one person, it will be enough. I have people writing to me, ‘thank you for photographing this place that nobody wants to. It used to be my home and now it’s gone.' And that keeps me going.” Before It All Goes: Architecture From Singapore’s Early Independence Years runs until Sep 29 at Objectifs, 155 Middle Road.

It emerged on Wednesday (Aug 22) that Kwan - author of the best-selling novel on which the film is based - failed to \"register for national service (NS) in 1990, despite notices and letters sent to his overseas address\", according to the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).   “Mr Kwan has committed offences under the Enlistment Act, and is liable to a fine of up to S$10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 3 years upon conviction,” said MINDEF. The news caused a stir online, with many comments on social media, and some Singaporean cast members of the film spoke up about how this could affect the local audience. Both Janice Koh, who plays Felicity Young in the movie, and Koh Chieng Mun, who plays Neena Goh, told Channel NewsAsia that this is “a private matter\" between Kwan and MINDEF. “It does not in any way detract from the quality of his book or the movie based on it, which is delighting readers and audiences all over the world,” added Janice Koh. Tan Kheng Hua, who plays Kerry Chu, the mother of protagonist Rachel Chu, agreed. “Good common sense tells you Kevin Kwan’s gloriously affecting novels and the delightful movie adaptation of it currently connecting people all over the world with joy and positive messages of inclusivity and diversity, and MINDEF, are two completely separate things and should be treated as such,” she said. For Koh Chieng Mun, the news does not undermine the quality of the best-selling book and critically acclaimed film. “(Look) how it has been a source of joy and enjoyment to audiences in the United States,” she said. “And now in Asia.” Actress Amy J. Cheng, who plays Jacqueline Ling in the film, says that ultimately, all that matters is an audience making “a strong connection with a solid piece of work”. “Crazy Rich Asians is currently the No. 1 box office movie in the US. The books have been on The Straits Times best seller list for the past 50 weeks,” she said. “The audience has spoken.” Kwan's debut novel about the lives of extremely wealthy Chinese families living in Singapore became an instant global bestseller back in 2013. The film adaptation, helmed by Asian-American Jon M. Chu with Kwan on board as executive producer, soared to the top of the US box office when it earned US$35 million (S$47.9 million) in its opening five days. Crazy Rich Asians - the first big, contemporary studio film featuring an all-Asian cast in over 25 years since The Joy Luck Club - has been hailed in Hollywood as a breakthrough for racial representation. The cast boasts Asian actors from all over the world, including Michelle Yeoh, Henry Golding, Constance Wu, Gemma Chan and Ken Jeong. Supported by the Singapore Tourism Board and the Singapore Film Commission, the movie was largely filmed in Singapore and included nearly 300 film crew members who are Singaporean or Singapore permanent residents. Kwan reportedly grew up in a multi-generational house in Bukit Timah and attended Anglo Chinese School (Primary) until he was 11, before emigrating to Houston, Texas with his parents and two older brothers.  He is now an American citizen, according to the reports. He told Channel NewsAsia in a previous interview that while making Crazy Rich Asians, he was “very conscious of trying to showcase Singapore in as positive a light as possible\". “I really hope Singaporeans will see that this is a love letter to Singapore,” he said. “I wrote what I knew… and I wanted to pay tribute to all types of Singaporeans.” ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/crazy-rich-asians-actors-react-kevin-kwan-skip-national-service-10641328"}, {"datetime": "22 Aug 2018 07:06PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Team Singapore", "Joseph Schooling"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games: Schooling wins Singapore's first gold medal after retaining 100m fly crown ", "content": " JAKARTA: Olympic champion Joseph Schooling won Singapore's first gold medal at the 2018 Asian Games after retaining his men's 100m butterfly title on Wednesday night (Aug 22).  He clocked 51.04s to touch the wall first ahead of his closest competitors at the Gelora Bung Karno aquatic centre in Jakarta, setting a new Games record.  China's Li Zhuhao took silver, clocking 51.46s, while Japan's Yuki Kobori took bronze with 51.77s.  Schooling's national teammate Quah Zheng Wen finished fourth after clocking 52.54s.  Schooling was the fastest qualifier in the heats on Wednesday morning, while Quah placed fourth.   The gold is Schooling's second medal at the 2018 Asian Games after he helped the men's 4x200m relay team clinch bronze on Monday.  The 23-year-old rose to prominence after winning the 100m butterfly title at the 2014 edition of the Games in Incheon.  He went on to win Singapore’s first-ever gold medal at the Olympics, beating swimming legend Michael Phelps in the final in 2016.  \"EVERY GOLD IS SPECIAL\" Speaking to media on Wednesday night, Schooling said he was nervous at the start of the race.

Schooling's national teammate Quah Zheng Wen qualified fourth fastest overall, clocking 52.76s.  Schooling told reporters after the race that he was satisfied with the effort as he \"wanted the middle lane\" for the final.  “I thought that was fine; morning swim, most important thing was getting into the top eight,\" said Schooling. “What you do two years ago doesn’t have a bearing over what you do now”: #OneTeamSG’s Joseph Schooling after qualifying fastest for the 100m butterfly finals at #AsianGames https://t.co/gvxWXMKdci pic.twitter.com/fA5CCybi4q   Schooling also spoke about his closest competitors for tonight's final and said he expects Li to \"drop more time\" for tonight's final.  \"Li has been swimming all this meet.

Everybody (in Hollywood) was like, is this CGI? Does this place really exist?,\" Xie, who plays gold-digging opera star Kitty Pong, told reporters. \"This is a homecoming!\" she said. The film, the first Hollywood movie in 25 years with an all-Asian cast, is a rare Hollywood showcase of Asian identity and culture, which the filmmakers hope will be enjoyed by moviegoers of all backgrounds. The romantic comedy about an Asian-American New Yorker, who goes to Singapore to meet her boyfriend's wealthy and tradition-bound family of Chinese descent, is based on the 2013 best-selling book of the same name by Kevin Kwan. The Warner Bros film directed by Jon M Chu, launched above expectations, garnering US$34 million in just five days. The film, with a mostly eastern Asian cast, has drawn criticism for not representing Singapore's multi-ethnic society. \"The film is set in Singapore, where 15 per cent of the population are Malay and 7.4 per cent are Indian, and none of them are represented in the film except as the background help,\" said activist and journalist Kirsten Han on Twitter. However, others saw it as an opportunity to tell other diverse Singapore stories. \"This movie is going to open more doors for us to tell the world more Singapore stories,\" 19 year-old university student, Andrea Raeburn told Reuters at the premiere. The film's producer, John Penotti also shared similar sentiments: \"We hope this starts a very long-running trend celebrating Asian-focused films that play around the world, that's exactly the hope for the portrayal of Asians, that's exactly what is starting to happen.

Cash remains the preferred “gift” for many. And the bigger the ang pow, the better, many think. Since the launch of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre’s Company of Good programme in 2016, we have engaged over 1,000 businesses in Singapore and gained insight into how companies think about giving back to society. More of them understand why giving back matters. Companies profit from communities, and it is their responsibility to help communities when in need. Savvy ones also appreciate the benefits giving brings. But misconceptions still exist, the most striking of which is the assumption that cash is king. The common thinking is that a company that donates S$1 million has contributed more than one that gives only S$1,000. Think about how our society celebrates hefty dollar donation - with giant cheque-giving ceremonies and charity auctions rewarding the highest bidder. WHEN CASH ISN'T KING  To be clear, there is nothing wrong if a company makes monetary contributions. In fact, many non-profits welcome the flexibility of cash.   Problems start when society over-emphasises monetary giving, leading to narrow definitions of how companies can contribute SMEs suffer most from this mindset, believing they have nothing to give. \"We’re not the big boys. We can’t donate hundreds of thousands,” is a refrain we hear. But volunteerism, offering assets like venue facilities, or cause advocacy matter just as much. Think F&B companies that educate customers on food wastage and plastic consumption. This social consciousness can be a differentiating factor for smaller brands. Company size doesn’t matter when it comes to the quality of giving. Industries with a small number of employees have volunteerism rates on par with or even higher than those with larger employee pools. With SMEs making up over 90 per cent of enterprises in Singapore, we need them to believe in their potential to contribute even if they lack deep pockets. It does not benefit Singapore’s giving if our charities remain stuck courting a tiny 1 per cent of large firms and multinationals.  The thing is businesses are not rapacious beasts who give for cosmetic reasons. Our conversations with companies reveal sincere beliefs about helping those in need. In fact, cash donations risk feeling transactional especially if they take the form of a CSR manager writing out a cheque without meaningful interaction with the charity. This reduces the company to an ATM, and the giving becomes emotionally and strategically disconnected from the business. There is little reason to sustain it, especially during recessions when corporate philanthropy budgets come under greater scrutiny. And yet, bad times are when the poor need help the most. A BROADER VIEW OF GIVING The good news is that Singapore’s corporate giving scene is gradually maturing. Of the over 700 companies surveyed in NVPC’s inaugural Corporate Giving Survey, a promising 52 per cent are engaged in corporate giving, and a further 31 per cent expressed interest to start. While cash donations dominate, businesses are clearly exploring other ways of contributing. Riding on this momentum, perhaps it is time to shift the narrative around corporate giving. Rather than rehashing the mantra of giving more cash, we should have more meaningful conversations around other ways companies can give. FROM GIVING MORE TO GIVING IN OTHER WAYS Just like how financial planners recommend a spread of investments, we can encourage companies to consider a diverse giving portfolio to reduce reliance on any one method. While over 60 per cent of corporate givers still give through cash donations, there is healthy engagement in other ways including in-kind donations (37 per cent) and the purchase of goods and services from non-profits (30 per cent), which came in at second and third place respectively. Potential givers also show a higher inclination toward volunteerism compared to current givers, with 30 per cent saying they would carry out hands-on volunteerism – the third most popular method, after cash and in-kind donations.  This willingness to explore other forms of giving is a positive trend society should recognise and celebrate. Already, we see examples of small firms thinking creatively. Social enterprise The Mindful Company collaborates with charities to create products with inspiring messages around mental wellness. The digitally-savvy team also gives its expertise by informally consulting charity partners on branding and content marketing. Elsewhere, we have seen a boutique creative agency that not only does pro-bono work but has leveraged its relationship with media owners to secure advertising spots for an adopted charity – in effect, “giving” through its business networks.  The definition of “pro-bono\" has also gone beyond the legal profession, as tech companies give away complimentary digital and software services, and providing training to non-profit users. GIVING STRATEGICALLY EQUALS GIVING BETTER Another conversation we should have is whether companies are adopting a strategic orientation toward giving activities. While not necessarily giving more, are they giving more effectively? Our survey suggests companies may be moving in this direction. 64 per cent of corporate givers currently integrate a giving element into at least one business function, chiefly procurement (30 per cent), followed by staff development, and marketing and branding (28 per cent each). It will be interesting to see if this momentum continues and grows in subsequent years. A good number are also aligning their social and business objectives. 66 per cent of corporate givers that engaged in volunteerism were motivated by the positive knock-on effects for staff morale – where giving helps achieve goals like recruitment, leadership development and staff retention – while 43 per cent did it because it supported their business model.  To use an analogy, these companies are making giving part of their \"core curriculum\" as opposed to a co-curricular activity. An example is local firm Feng Ming Construction. After realising the limitations of conventional “cheque-book philanthropy”, Feng Ming has shifted towards having staff volunteer with non-profit AWWA to renovate homes for families-in-need. Feng Ming reaps the benefit of motivated employees, who feel proud to use their skills for good. By relying on in-house expertise, the project is more efficient compared to if it had given the charity cash to hire a sub-contractor. MARRYING PROFIT AND PURPOSE Companies generally agree that giving is good for business so it’s time to encourage businesses to think about giving differently to overcome perceived resource barriers. It is a win if businesses can marry profit and purpose, and corporate giving teams are likelier to secure internal buy-in if their giving initiatives fulfil company goals. The more giving is sustainable, the higher the chance of turning it into a corporate culture. Once this happens, giving will become intuitive among staff and management, requiring less justification.  That's something money can’t buy.

We had a rescue plan, but the dive wasn't part of it.\" During the rescue, she injured her spine, her neck and her right knee, seriously aggravating an old injury. Ms Fang continues to feel the effects today and has lost some of her mobility. But this isn't going to stop her or Bunny Wonderland Singapore, her private rabbit rescue group, from carrying out their mission. Established five years ago, 15 volunteers aim to save and find new homes for pet rabbits which have been abandoned or surrendered. “Bunny Wonderland’s primary objective is to rescue the neglected and the sick animals - we will nurse them back to health and we will put them up for adoption,\" said Ms Lynne Tan, who founded the group with Ms Fang. Since its inception in 2013, Ms Tan estimates that Bunny Wonderland has rescued between 350 to 400 rabbits and found new homes for many of them. However, Bunny Wonderland isn't the only volunteer rabbit rescue group in Singapore. The House Rabbits Society of Singapore (HRSS) is a non-profit group dedicated to rabbit welfare and education about the animals. The group rescues over a hundred rabbits a year, said vice-president Jacelyn Heng.  \"Just because you don't see them, it doesn't mean that they are not there,\" said Ms Heng. \"If rabbits are abandoned, they will hide first because they are prey animals. They only come out twice - in the early morning when they search for food and in the late evening. These are the two timings we go out to rescue them.\"  Rabbits are usually left abandoned in parks, said both rescue groups. A number also have been left in HDB estates, either in cages or wandering among void decks and car parks. “When people abandon rabbits intentionally, they don’t want them to be found. So they choose very secluded parts of Singapore like parks,\" said Ms Tan. “We had a couple of rabbits found in rubbish bins, people knew about it when they heard rustling sounds (from) inside the rubbish bin. One of them was even wrapped up in a plastic bag and you could see a head popping out.” HOPPING AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITIES Some people purchase rabbits because they think that the animals are not only cuddly but easy to care for, said Ms Tan. “It's quite common for people to walk by pet shops and see very cute rabbits. Of course,  when you see cute things, you just want to have them,\" she added. \"There’s a misconception that rabbits are small and cute and easy to care for, which is typically what they are marketed as – pocket pets or starting pets for children. It doesn’t take long for people to realise that it is all false, because rabbits will grow.\" Rabbits can also breed very quickly, leading to problems when owners find themselves with an unwanted litter of babies and no means to care for them. “Two rabbits can easily give birth at the age of five months and every litter could be four to eight rabbits and they could have babies every twenty-eight days,\" Ms Tan added. \"That’s their gestation period ... the poor little rabbit could give birth over and over again. So if you don’t control the population (of your pets), it just grows exponentially.\" VULNERABLE TO ATTACK When unwanted rabbits are left to fend for themselves in the wild, these domestic pets have no chance of survival, said Ms Heng, who has been part of HRSS for fifteen years. \"Rabbits may just be bitten by cats, dogs or predators,\" she stressed. \"Abandoning them is like sending them to a slow and painful death.\" This has been witnessed first-hand by some of the Bunny Wonderland personnel such as Ms Fang.   “There was a rescue in Sembawang. We knew about the case and when we rushed down, the two rabbits were already dead. I suspect that they met predators,” she recalled. \"Sometimes, it is sad to say - and this is not only in Singapore - that quite a lot of adults don’t recognise that animals are also living things. They treat them as toys.\" The condition that the abandoned rabbits are found in also varies. Some are in reasonably good shape, due to owners taking care of them for an extended period of time before giving them up. But others which come from breeding farms or from overbreeding cases may not be so lucky. Ms Fang, who works in the oil and gas industry, estimates that she forks out close to $100,000 annually from her own pocket on medical bills for the rescued rabbits. Bunny Wonderland also raises funds on its Facebook page. \"Owners typically may not know the health of their rabbit – they would tell us that they are fine but when we bring the rabbits to see a doctor, we realise their livers are infected, their kidneys are malfunctioning, they are dehydrated and they are not well. We end up uncovering all these for the owners instead,\" added co-founder Ms Tan. At Bunny Wonderland, the rescued rabbits are nursed back to health at Ms Fang's home - which is affectionately known as the same name by members of the group. The landed property hosts close to 30 rabbits, most of which are housed in individual play pens where they have space to exercise. Most of the rabbits are housed in an airy open area on the ground floor, while others reside in three different spaces upstairs. There is a quarantine room for rabbits which have just been rescued, another where rabbits are kept which require special care due to old age or other issues, and Ms Fang's bedroom - the 'Intensive Care Unit' for rabbits with more serious disabilities such as head tilt. “Jackie’s home – what she calls Bunny Wonderland - is the primary place where we keep all our rescued rabbits,\" said Ms Tan.  \"Typically, once a rabbit is rescued we have no clue what’s going on within them. So we quarantine them, and typically this is done at a vet’s clinic where they can receive the treatments. Then a few days later, we bring them to foster homes and Jackie place is the primary foster home. In times where we need more capacity, we will look out to our volunteers and they are typically the (other) foster homes for our rabbits.” At both Bunny Wonderland and HRSS, the goal is to find new homes for the abandoned rabbits. While both rescue groups say that the number of abandoned animals continues to hold steady, they take comfort in the fact that attitudes towards rabbits seem to be changing. \"The numbers of abandoned rabbits are not dropping but I do see more rabbit 'parents' improving the welfare of the rabbits as the years go by,\" said Ms Heng. \"They treat their rabbits as more precious (pets) now.\" \"We see more people talking about sterilisation of the rabbits, more stepping up to support them choosing adoption over buying a pet,\" added Ms Tan. \"That itself proves that what we are trying to advocate is heard. We do this because it’s what we are passionate about – it is just part of our life.\" Ask Ms Fang if she could go back to that rabbit rescue where she was injured to do anything differently, and her answer is an emphatic one. “To me there are no regrets, because I love them.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/groups-fighting-to-save-abandoned-abused-rabbits-10577208"}, {"datetime": "22 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["manpower", "road safety", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Derrick A Paulo", "title": "Overworked and low-paid, heavy vehicle drivers an accident waiting to happen", "content": " SINGAPORE: When a lorry collided with Marcus Loke and two of his friends on West Coast Highway in 2016, he narrowly escaped death. The first few days in hospital were “very difficult” for the then 17-year-old, who kept wondering about his friends Ong Zi Quan, 19, and Ang Yee Fong, 25. They had been riding to his grandmother’s home on their power-assisted bicycles. When the police told him about their deaths, he cried, the pain in his heart coming on top of his leg injuries. In April, the driver was charged in court. Today, whenever Mr Loke sees heavy goods vehicles approaching, his first thought is “move aside”. He said: “Sometimes I see those truck drivers and I think they drive a bit too fast.” Certainly, heavy vehicles are claiming a disproportionate number of lives. They make up five per cent of the vehicle population but have been involved in three in 10 fatal road accidents in the last two years. Last year, there were 764 accidents involving heavy vehicles, of which 34 were fatal. In June, a chain collision set off by a lorry left one person dead along Tanah Merah Coast Road. Two months earlier, a lorry rammed into a father, daughter and their family friend near Yio Chu Kang Station, killing them. Why are these vehicles turning the roads into sudden death traps? Are heavy vehicle drivers more reckless? As the programme Talking Point discovers, a vicious circle is at work in the industry, potentially putting other drivers and pedestrians at risk. (Watch the episode here.) There are also solutions that can help to prevent accidents and make the roads safer, but more could be done. DRIVEN HARD, WITH LITTLE CHOICE The experience of Ravi (not his real name), a lorry driver for three years, is instructive. His normal working hours are 8am to 5pm, but the 31-year-old then works five to six hours of overtime to earn more money. Driving for that long means he gets tired, as he has to keep pressing and letting out the clutch when there is heavy traffic. His concentration, for example on his blind spots, is gradually affected. The migrant worker said he has not been involved in any accident but knows of other drivers who have, owing to fatigue and carelessness; for instance, they did not keep a proper lookout for pedestrians. Ravi is working longer than the limits set by law, which is 12 hours a day and 72 hours of overtime in a month for employees like him. Beyond that, companies must apply to the Manpower Ministry for an exemption. He understands that is the law, but he said: “Not only I, but many people are working long hours.” When Talking Point asked other drivers, they too said they sometimes work 14 or 15 hours a day. One of them, who has occasional headaches and back pains as a result, said: Sometimes I take a tablet (Panadol), sometimes an energy drink. Another driver, when asked how his boss would respond to complaints of fatigue, cited threats to send him back to his home country. Their long working day is a “pretty common theme” among migrant workers, said Dr Noorashikin Abdul Rahman, the president of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). “These workers don’t have much of a choice.” With drivers, she noted, the safety issue concerns not only them but also others. She cited a recent case of a driver who told TWC2 that he was forced to work despite having a medical certificate. “Because of that, he got involved in an accident. So this is something that’s unfair to him,” she added. The employers have the balance of power. The law is actually clear about the maximum working hours (and) overtime a worker can do, so they should abide by this. INDUSTRY ISSUES Mr Daniel Chew, a corporate consultant at the Singapore Logistics Association, agreed that the legal requirements as well as the fatigue drivers experience are well known in the industry. The reason that overwork is still “quite widespread”, he said, is that “many companies are struggling” with a lack of drivers. So they “circumvent” the law by running split shifts. Workers would start as early as 6am and work for about six hours, followed by a break, before finishing another six hours. “It’s still within the law because the actual working hours are 12,” he added. “The unfortunate thing is that (during) the four hours in the middle of the day for these drivers, they don’t really take a lot of time to rest. Sometimes they do other work, or they’re involved in other things.” It is a recipe for disaster, he agreed. Just a split-second kind of negligence can result in a very serious accident, especially when the vehicle is very big. The way drivers are paid is another problem. To save money, some employers keep basic salaries low, between S$1,500 and S$2,000 a month. But drivers can increase their income if they make more trips. To do that, they “must drive fast”, admitted one driver. That is why Mr Chew has previously called for a revamp of the traditional incentive structure, suggesting three alternative models. These are: Pay by distance completed, regardless of the number of trips made; pay by teams instead of individuals, to reduce the drivers’ competitive nature; and pay by conformance, by rewarding those who drive below the speed limit. Drivers themselves recognise the current problem, besides the fact that there are those who are reckless. Said one: “Honestly, (being paid per trip) is more dangerous.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SAFETY TECHNOLOGY How else can the roads be kept safer? By installing safety devices, as logistics service provider Bok Seng Group has done for its fleet. Besides gadgets that monitor for speeding, there is anti-fatigue technology, such as an in-vehicle camera pointed at the driver to detect any dozing off. It would make a beeping noise, and he would be jolted awake by a vibration. A signal would also be sent to the office. If he nods off again, a response centre from the safety technology’s Australian company would call Bok Seng’s health and safety department about the fatigued driver. “Then we’d call the controller to please check whether this driver is having some problem like drowsiness,” said Bok Seng Group health and safety senior manager Steven Tan, 43. The installation cost per vehicle is around S$4,000, and the company spent over S$200,000 last year on safety devices. “The cost is a bit pricey, but we can’t compare the price against the cost of a life,” he added. The result: A 33 per cent drop in cases of driver fatigue within six months, on top of speeding incidents coming down by 80 per cent over the past four years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Three other companies have speed-tracking devices on trial in 30 vehicles until this month, in partnership with the Traffic Police, which aims to find a technology to complement or replace the speed limiters in heavy vehicles to curb speeding effectively. The combination of speeding and fatigue can have disastrous consequences. Fatigued drivers can suffer from tunnel vision – seeing what is in front but not vehicles or people on the sides. A tired brain also causes lapses of judgement, like not being able to judge one’s speed or braking distance and turning too early or going too fast while turning, said Singapore Safety Driving Centre operation group leader Low Kar Yoong. From her conversations with heavy vehicle drivers, Talking Point host Diana Ser thinks more must be done \"to address what appears to be a systemic flaw”. “Some of our heavy vehicle drivers are downright exhausted, and companies need to be held accountable. After all, one death on the road is one too many,\" she said. Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

They should also avoid speculating in the market hoping for a \"big payout at the end of the day\", he said, adding that the Government will try its best to manage expectations. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had announced at the National Day Rally on Sunday that the Government will take back some Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats starting from when they reach 70 years old to redevelop the housing estates. Homeowners will get to vote on whether they want to move out and will receive compensation if their flats are taken back, Mr Lee had said. However, details of the scheme are still being worked out and it will only be implemented in about 20 years' time. Mr Lee had also announced that each Housing Board flat will be upgraded twice under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) II. On Tuesday, Mr Wong added that the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) will continue to run its course until all remaining sites with high development potential have been cleared. According to the HDB’s estimates, only about 5 per cent of flats are suitable for SERS. \"There are still more to go but we will eventually reach the limit … once we do that, we will transit to a VERS programme,\" Mr Wong said. He added that the Government will be seeking more feedback on proposed changes to housing policies before the schemes are finetuned. Mr Wong was speaking to reporters after a feedback session conducted by REACH on the National Day Rally. The evening’s discussion,  which attracted more than 130 participants, ranged from concerns about the cost of living, to housing and foreign relations. Addressing the concerns of a forum participant about social divisiveness which could arise when polling is done for VERS, Mr Wong said: \"I acknowledge that in this case, stakes are higher ... but we have some experience and we will have time to study how to work out the exact mechanisms and how to go about doing it without causing too much division or without creating acrimony within the block itself.\" Leadership renewal for the Government was another area highlighted at the forum chaired by Mr Sam Tan, REACH chairman and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and for Social and Family Development.  A forum participant asked whether the long-term plans laid out during the National Day Rally can be fulfilled by the next prime minister. In response, Mr Wong said it is \"quite unique\" that Singapore is able to plan so far into the future. “I don’t know of any other country that is planning and thinking about urban rejuvenation at the scale that we are talking about.

The researchers say the test kit allows for faster results, at greater accuracy and a cheaper price. In collaboration with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Taiwan's Chang Gung University, the test uses salivary microRNA as a diagnostic marker to accurately detect the HFMD virus. HFMD is spread by contact via the bodily fluids of an infected person. There is currently no approved antiviral drug or vaccine available in Singapore. The disease sees an outbreak every two to three years, with its last peak seen in 2016 when the number of reported cases hit 42,000. About 29,000 cases have been reported as of August this year, a number researchers have warned is “alarming”. The current tests in hospitals - which include throat swabs and blood samples - are invasive and take about six hours for the results to be turned around. The NUS researchers say the new saliva test kit takes only two hours for results to be turned around, and can be used at childcare centres or at home. Associate Professor Justin Chu from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, who led the project, said the study was tested on 82 children. During the trial, the test picked up Singaporean HFMD cases with around 90 per cent accuracy, he added. The accuracy rate was 80 per cent when identifying Taiwanese cases, which Assoc Prof Chu said could be because of genetic differences or slightly different methods of processing the saliva samples. The team will have to test the kits on a larger group of children and obtain approval from the Health Sciences Authority before use here. Assoc Prof Chu said he is now looking to recruit 1,000 children from China and Vietnam to refine the test further. \"The main objective of this project is to look at how we can use this diagnostic on a daily basis in childcare centres where parents can even use it. That will actually help to enhance the pick-up rate of who's got HFMD and we could help to break the transmission chain of the infection,\" Assoc Prof Chu said. The new test is also able to pick up the virus before symptoms, such as fever, mouth ulcers or blisters on the hands or feet, appear. “(HFMD) can be misdiagnosed as we know that a lot of other viruses can cause similar symptoms ... So there are cases of misdiagnosis. By using this kit, we can enhance the specificity of detection,\" Assoc Prof Chu said.

The report - Elements of success: Urban transportation systems of 24 global cities - assessed the transport systems of 24 cities using more than 80 indicators over five main dimensions: Availability, affordability, efficiency, convenience and sustainability. Some of the indicators included the percentage of the population living or working within 1km of a train station, the cost of a monthly public transport ticket, as a percentage of average income and the average transport waiting time. The report covered all modes of transport - personal, public, shared, cycling, and walking. \n\n\n\n\n Singapore clinched the top spot for public transport affordability, and also scored well in transport efficiency and safety. \"Singapore has created a best-in-class public transport system, which is accessible, efficient, convenient, sustainable, and at the same time affordable,\" the report said. The report noted that a major step toward affordability was made in 2013, when the fares were reviewed and new measures were introduced, including a 15 per cent discount on adult fares for low-wage workers, free travel for children and seven other concessions.  As a result, more than one million public transport passengers benefited from the new schemes, McKinsey said. The city also scored a high rating for sustainability, with one of the \"safest and most ecologically sustainable\" public transport systems, according to the report.  The report said the convenience and flexibility of the Singaporean ticketing system, using the EZ-Link card, was another \"outstanding\" feature.  \n\n\n\n\n HIGH SATISFACTION AMONG SINGAPORE RESIDENTS In addition to objective dimensions, the report looked at public perception based on surveys of 400 residents in each city on how satisfied they were with the mobility options available to them as well as their sense of whether the system they used was changing for the better.  More than 30 transportation experts were also consulted to weigh the list of indicators and corresponding aspects according to their importance and impact on the quality of life.  Of the residents surveyed in Singapore, more than 80 per cent said they were satisfied with the overall public transport situation. This was higher than the 71 per cent that was satisfied with the overall situation in private transport. The McKinsey report stated that Singapore residents were the most satisfied on many of the aspects analysed, as compared to residents globally. Electronic services, such as trip planners, and their evolution were among the transport features that residents surveyed said they enjoyed the most. However, the survey respondents were concerned with the affordability of private transport, which the report noted was a result of Singapore's deliberate car limiting policy. HONG KONG, SEOUL AND BEIJING ALSO RANKED HIGHLY  Based on the report, four out of the top 10 cities for public transport were in Asia - aside from Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul and Beijing also made it onto the list.  McKinsey said that Hong Kong had among the best public transport coverage in the world, with 75 per cent of the population and 94 per cent of workplaces being within 1km of a metro station. Notably, the city scored points for its \"advanced\" ticketing system, the Octopus chip card, which can be used not only to pay for transport and non-transport services, but is also used for non-payment purposes, such as access control for office buildings. It also had the highest ranking for public transport safety, with lower rates of public transit fatalities per one million people as compared to other cities.  Seoul was ranked second among all of the cities for its public transport efficiency, with its progress driven by the optimisation of bus routes and construction of exclusive median bus lanes that increased bus speeds by an average of 30 per cent, according to the report. The development of an intelligent bus management system also played a crucial role in optimising bus headway and staying on schedule, making bus services more reliable, the report found.  Beijing ranked among the top 10 across all five dimensions, coming in 10th - ahead of Singapore's 12th - in terms of its rail infrastructure. Of the cities surveyed, 20 were selected based on size, level of economic development, transportation system characteristics, and availability of data. Four more - Berlin, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore - were chosen because their transportation systems were \"considered outstanding by external institutions\", according to McKinsey. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-public-transport-system-among-best-in-the-world-10637978"}, {"datetime": "21 Aug 2018 07:37PM", "tags": ["HDB", "housing", "Lawrence Wong", "VERS", "NDR 2018"], "author": "", "title": "‘It would be rash to rush into details now’: Lawrence Wong on new housing policy VERS", "content": " SINGAPORE: After the announcement of the new Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) for HDB homes, some questions have emerged about it, including how much home owners might receive and whether all flats will be eligible for it. “It would be rash to rush into details now when some of these things can only happen decades from now,” said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Aug 21) in an interview with Channel NewsAsia's Talking Point team. “Let’s not get too excited about what is going to be in the VERS package or which flats will get VERS or speculate unnecessarily,” he said when asked about details of the scheme.  The housing scheme was announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his National Day Rally speech on Sunday. Under VERS, the Government may buy back older HDB flats before their 99-year leases run out, and compensate residents whose flats are taken back early. Residents, who have to vote for VERS, can then use the proceeds to buy a new flat. The scheme will only start in about 20 years, Mr Lee said, when some flats reach 70 years old. “Obviously there is a lot of interest in what the details would be but this is a very long-term commitment and we will have to study how the implementation is to be done, and how it can be done in a way that is sustainable financially as well,” said Mr Wong. Part of the rationale for introducing VERS is to allow more HDB households to benefit from redevelopment before their 99-year leases run out. The issue of lease expiry has been a cause for concern among some home owners recently, and Mr Wong revealed that the Government has been looking into the matter for the past two years. When asked for his response on whether the VERS announcement was a way of “fobbing off questions on housing” ahead of the next general election, Mr Wong said the Government owes it to Singaporeans to share its plans for the future. “On the one hand there have been many requests for the Government to share some of its thinking about what roadmap for public housing will be,” he said. “If we were to hold back and only reveal or announce VERS when the details are ready, that might be 15 years from now, so people might be living with 15 years of uncertainty.” Mr Wong added: “We have been studying this for some time. Not quite ready with all the details and still a lot more work that needs to be done to work through the operational details and the implementation details. “But we thought that given concerns that have been raised, we do owe it to Singaporeans to explain at this stage, at the very broad level, our thinking about how we think the next phase of public housing will unfold over the coming years and decades.” HOW WILL GOVERNMENT PAY FOR VERS? When asked about whether the Government will ask the President to tap into the accumulated reserves to fund VERS, Mr Wong would only say that the scheme needs to be fiscally sustainable. “It is a significant fiscal expense and whatever we do we will have to make sure that fiscal arrangements for VERS are sustainable, and do not put a heavier burden on the next generation. So those are part of the details that we are working on,” said the minister. He added: “When we look at policy options, when we review policies, nothing is sacrosanct. You can always look at all the different options - there will always be pros and cons attached to any particular proposed measure, so we will have to review all of the possibilities and eventually work out what is best way forward.” Mr Wong also touched on the review of CPF rules to provide more flexibility for buyers of shorter-lease flats. On a suggestion if authorities would consider having CPF restrictions kick in only when there are 30 years left on the lease, instead of the current 60, Mr Wong said: “We know what the concerns are, there are many possibilities to address the concerns so I wouldn’t rule out anything at this stage until we have done a proper study, completed the study with the CPF Board.” Currently, if the remaining lease of a property is less than 60 years, there are restrictions on how much CPF money can be used to buy it. A home owner can use CPF money if his age plus the number of years left on the lease is at least 80 years – but subject to restrictions. However, if the remaining lease is less than 30 years, CPF cannot be used at all. Mr Wong cautioned: “I’m sure Singaporeans know that there is balance to be struck (with CPF retirement adequacy) so we are taking in all the considerations and seeing how best the rules can be updated.” Catch the interview with National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Thursday, Aug 23, at 9.30pm on Mediacorp's Channel 5.

Teo, 49, claimed trial and was found guilty on Tuesday (Aug 21) of two charges of attempted aggravated sexual assault of a minor, one charge of outraging the modesty of a minor and one charge of committing an indecent act with a child. The victim, who is now 15, testified that he first got to know Teo in March 2016, after his father chanced on a poster that advertised Teo's tuition services and hired him. He cannot be named due to a gag order. Teo began giving the boy lessons that month for about three to four times a week, with each lesson lasting at least three hours. The lessons were held either at Teo's home, or at a McDonald's outlet. The boy recalled that during the first tuition session at McDonald's, Teo slapped his buttocks each time he moved past Teo to get in or out of his seat. Although he was \"shocked\" and disliked this, the boy did not say anything to his teacher as he was scared. After the session, the boy told his parents about what happened.  They confronted Teo and told the boy to give Teo \"one more chance\", as Teo said he was merely showing that he was \"friendly\", court documents said. TEACHER TOOK BOY SWIMMING The attempted assault took place about two months after the victim started taking tuition lessons with Teo. On May 12, 2016, the boy went to the void deck of Teo's home, as he was supposed to have tuition alone with him. However, Teo came down with his swimming equipment and told the boy that he had two options: To go swimming before going home, or to have tuition first before going swimming. The boy was confused as Teo had not told him before this that they would be going swimming. However, he chose the first option as \"he felt lazy\", court documents said. He asked Teo why they were going swimming, and Teo said that the boy's father wanted him to take the boy swimming. Teo took the boy to the swimming pool at the Home Team NS Clubhouse in Bukit Batok West. In the male changing room there, Teo took out a pair of swimming tights for the boy to put on. The boy complained that they were too tight and that he felt uncomfortable. Teo told him that he could help him to adjust his tights, but the boy declined and said he would do it himself. Despite the boy refusing, Teo put his hand into the boy's tights and molested him. The boy tried to rationalise Teo's actions in his mind, choosing to give him the benefit of the doubt, court documents said. He followed Teo into the pool, where Teo placed his hands on the boy's hips, touching his buttocks. Again, the victim rationalised that the teacher wanted to guide him. After the swim, the pair returned to the male changing room, where there was no one else. Teo said they would shower together, as he had brought only one towel. The boy told Teo to shower first, but Teo forcibly pulled him into the cubicle by his shoulder. Inside the cubicle, Teo molested the boy and attempted to sexually assault him twice. After that, the victim followed Teo to KFC for a meal, during which Teo told the victim with a smile: \"I rub you very clean. Do you feel very clean right now?\" The boy later explained that he did not run away as he was afraid that Teo would \"start suspecting me and chase me\". He also feared that Teo would rape or kidnap him. After the meal, Teo took him home on his motorcycle. VICTIM LOCKED HIMSELF IN HIS ROOM ONCE HE GOT HOME Once the boy reached home, he told his mother that Teo had molested him, before locking himself in his room. His mother tried to find out more, but he threw a fuss and revealed only that Teo had \"rubbed my whole body\". She told the court that on the day of the incident, her son ran into the house and locked the main door, telling her that he was very frightened. After he told her briefly what had happened, she called her husband, who was overseas, before calling Teo. Teo initially denied doing anything, but later conceded that he had showered the victim, the boy's mother said. It was only after his father spoke to him that the boy revealed the attempted sexual assault. The boy's father decided that they should lodge a report, and the boy did not reveal the incident to anyone else, as he was \"embarrassed that they will make fun of me for being a coward\".  The boy's mother filed a police report in June 2016. After the incident, the boy suffered flashbacks of Teo abusing him and said he became \"homophobic\" and \"threw short tantrums\". The boy's mother testified that her son felt inferior after the incident, declining to mix with his friends and insisting that \"I'm not such good material\". She said the boy isolated himself after the incident and blamed his father, saying that \"father got me into trouble\". The father himself felt bad about introducing Teo to his son and said he could not communicate with his son, as he was \"always very angry\" with him. He also felt disappointed with himself, that he had put his son through this ordeal. PROSECUTOR SAYS ACCUSED GAVE 'EMBELLISHED' ACCOUNT Deputy Public Prosecutor Eunice Lau called the accused's account \"highly embellished, inconsistent and downright incredible\". While the prosecution had called for eight witnesses throughout the trial, the defence had only one witness, Teo, whose main thrust was of bare denial. The prosecution asked for at least 10 years' jail and 27 strokes of the cane, saying that there was a clear abuse of authority, with intrinsic elements of depravity and premeditation. She pointed out that Teo had a previous conviction in 2009, when he was given 16 months' jail and three strokes of the cane for outrage of modesty.  Asking for a sentence of eight years and eight months' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, defence lawyer Richard Lim said his client excelled in coaching and that the victim's results \"improved tremendously\" after his lessons. Teo stopped tutoring after the incident and worked as a part-time waiter, Mr Lim added. He said that there was \"no evidence of any physical injury caused to the victim in the medical report\", and said Teo had cooperated with police investigations.

EMBRACING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who was the guest of honour at Tuesday’s event, reiterated the importance for local SMEs to embrace digital technologies. In his speech, he drew parallels between the obstacles that SMEs have and the challenges that Singapore faces in a global business environment.  “In the larger scheme of things, Singapore is like an SME in the global business environment,” he said. “Firstly, we do not necessarily have scale. Secondly, we need to transcend our size and geography to reach out to markets and resources that are often beyond our borders.”  But the new digital economy allows SMEs and small countries, like Singapore, to transcend geographical size and resource limitations as connectivity is what matters on a digital platform, said Mr Chan.  “Just as Singapore is able to connect to many markets, using digital platforms allow our SMEs to transcend geography,” he explained, while citing examples of how some local SMEs have made use of digital platforms to participate in China’s Singles’ Day online sales bonanza.  However, he stressed that SMEs should go beyond digitalising current work procedures.  Instead, they should make use of digital platforms to transform the way they do market analysis, product design and even restructure production processes.  “These are the things that allow our SMEs to achieve the quantum leap in terms of their capabilities and capacity,” he said.  Mr Chan also urged MNCs to work alongside local SMEs in going global and innovating work processes, as well as for SMEs to spread the word on embracing the digital economy.  “Let us all embrace the digital economy together. We all can not only individually benefit as an SME or an individual company, but more importantly together in Singapore, to have that network effect and that synergy,” he said.  “With that, we can compete on the basis of an entire team Singapore.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/smes-to-get-more-help-in-digital-adoption-with-enhanced-99-sme-10637264"}, {"datetime": "21 Aug 2018 02:28PM", "tags": ["Immigration and Checkpoints Authority"], "author": "", "title": "4,000 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes found at Tuas Checkpoint", "content": " SINGAPORE: A total of 4,000 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes were found by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at Tuas Checkpoint last Thursday (Aug 16), the authority said on Tuesday.  In a Facebook post, ICA said that officers had observed \"anomalies in the scanned images\" of a Malaysia-registered lorry entering Singapore.

It is difficult to make sense of what transpired, because the activity is clearly unauthorised and there are existing laws that discourage such activities. Furthermore, how could this have happened in an organisational setting imbued with noble life-saving principles and practices? This incident can best be understood under the umbrella term of ragging. The activities engaged in can also be described as harassment and bullying. While the mood was celebratory, to mark the happy occasion of his graduation, it was marred by the unauthorised ritual that unfortunately has become sewed into the cultural embroidery of the organisation. A GLOBAL PHENOMENA A review of the literature reflects that such induction rites of passage are a global phenomena, especially prevalent in schools, colleges, universities, sporting fraternities, and in the uniformed services. In a 2017 book titled Emerging Ritual in Secular Societies, scholar Matthieu Smyth refers to the humiliating ragging rituals inflicted upon young pupils in boarding schools in the UK. Sports psychologist Jennifer Waldron in her book chapter on hazing in sport published in 2016 in the International Handbook of Sport Psychology wrote of how initiation rituals can be degrading, humiliating, and even brutal. These rites of passage have evolved in modern sport in the United States and Canada. Similar phenomena exist across the world, referred to as bizutage in French, mopokaste in Finnish, novatada in Spanish, ragging in India, and praxe in Portuguese. Across the continents (Brazil, India, Sri Lanka), there are research investigations documenting the prevalence of ragging in medical and dental colleges and universities, in law and business schools.   In a 2008 study, psychiatrist Jorge Srabstein found that between 1950 to 2007, there were 250 reported cases in English-language newspapers from around the world linked to bullying, hazing or ragging.  He wrote that the majority of the reports of bullying related deaths (62.3 per cent) originated in Europe, and most of them (93 per cent) occurred in the UK. This could also be attributed to the accuracy of reporting such deaths in different countries.   SECRECY, SELF-PERPETUATING These rites are undertaken under a cloak of secrecy as it is understood that they are not condoned by officials. The perpetrators are usually “seniors” who had previously undergone similar treatment. The practices or rituals or \"ragging\" may be conducted with or without any intended malice but this would hinge on the personalities of those doing the initiation, and the perceived shortfalls, upstart or fearful personalities of those being initiated. Once they \"pass\" the initiation, the new entrant is often received warmly into the group. Sometimes those who conducted the rigorous initiation, especially in tertiary institutions, will permit those who \"graduated\" from the initiation to rag them in turn for a permitted period of time - as a mark of goodwill. The activity is self-perpetuating – as a “mindless” cultural norm, passed on from one institutional generation to the next. The simplistic exhortation is “this is the way it is done here” and that “these are the rules and you must follow them”. The execution of such a practice provides a sense of power and control to the perpetrators, and renders a sense of victimisation and powerlessness among those subjected to the ragging. Research across countries reflects a predominance of negative impact on the latter such as depression, anxiety, even suicidal acts. RECOURSE TO LEGISLATION Those subject to ragging can find solace in the rule of law.  In Singapore, the Protection from Harassment Act spells out scenarios which would render punishable by law any person who intentionally causes harassment, alarm or distress. It also covers communications or behaviour that is threatening, abusive or insulting, and would definitively cover the context of ragging, hazing and bullying. Similar legislation exists in the US, and Australia and other developed countries, spelling out acts that people should be protected against. However, the existence of such legislation by itself has not curtailed acts of bullying and harassment. MORE CAN BE DONE TO PROTECT AND PREVENT It may not be possible to eliminate ragging entirely but perhaps organisations could spell out clearly what the boundaries are where such informal \"initiation\" rites are known to exist. Organisations can give clear notices and reminders of what is permitted and what is not. In this, damaging acts to life and limb and denigration that attacks the self-respect of the new entrant must be ruled out.  To fill the perceived vacuum of a more broadly inclusive and meaningful rite of passage for new entrants, it befits organisations to invest in a more broadly engaging and involving ceremonious rite of passage where seniors formally welcome new enlistees into the group.  This would serve the purpose of recognising the immediate “seniors” whose role are now as guides and mentors to the new entrants. Study by psychologists Glenn Walters and Dorothy Espelage recently published on School Psychology Quarterly, discussed how the construct of “psychological inertia” serves to maintain bullying behaviour.  Actions are carried out without examination of reasons or rationale. Cognitive impulsivity (including acting or behaving based on impulsive or automatic thinking rather than deliberated deep thinking) perpetrates the acts of bullying. This suggests that managing ragging would require some level of education and changes in mindsets. That, beyond religious beliefs, there is a need to inculcate morality, kindness, and other ethical values and attitudes necessary for healthy social existence in our present digital age.

But Sujatha Asokan has demonstrated a steadfast loyalty to one particular dish all her life, and that’s assam laksa – a special dish that holds particular significance for this young chef. The 27-year-old heads the kitchen at The Garage, an establishment consisting of modern European bistro Botanico and casual cafe The Bee’s Knees, located in a heritage building in the Botanic Gardens. Ever since she took over the reins a year ago, the daughter of a Chinese mother and an Indian father has introduced the piquant Asian flavours she grew up with into her menus. Dining at Botanico, for instance, you might opt for the “Curry” Lamb Neck slow-cooked for 24 hours and served with Vadouvan-spiced king oyster mushrooms (S$32); or the Iberico Char Siew accompanied by carrot noodles, carrot puree and honey pork jus (S$34). And for dessert, you’d have a tough time choosing between the Lemongrass Panna Cotta topped with ginger ice cream (S$10), and the Jalapeno Ice Cream with charred Sarawak pineapple, dehydrated bacon financier and micro coriander. A KITCHEN FULL OF AUNTS But Sujatha herself, or Su, as she prefers to be known, never has any trouble deciding what to order when she hangs out at her favourite haunt – a Penang eatery in the Geylang area. It is always assam laksa. “I’m a very boring person,” she declared. “If I like something, I go back there and I keep ordering that thing.” Her singlemindedness probably has a lot to do with the fact that her earliest kitchen memory, which is also her most significant, revolves around the sour, spicy noodle dish. The die was cast at the age of six. As a child, she would travel regularly with her parents and older brother to visit her mother’s family in Kedah, Malaysia. There, her four aunts would fill the kitchen with sights, sounds, smells and bustle. “At first, I would just watch, not really understanding what was happening. But gradually, the smells and everything made me curious about what was going on in there. I saw that when they all cooked together, it brought the family together,” Su recounted. “They made all the usual dishes in Chinese home cooking, but the dish that really caught my attention was assam laksa. The smell would fill the whole place,” she recalled. “I used to find the final product too spicy – although it was very shiok – so they would tease me and say, ‘Your father is Indian. Why can’t you take spicy food?’ Then, they would lower the spice level for me.” As time went on, she was allowed to help make the dish. And after this piqued her interest in cooking, she also began to “kaypoh” around her paternal grandmother’s kitchen in Singapore. “She’s Indian, so she made things like curry and raita. I grew closer to her by going to see what was happening in her kitchen and trying to help her.” At Botanico, Su’s heartfelt tribute to the dish that started it all is the Seabass Ceviche, which is her interpretation of assam laksa. Here, diced local seabass is dressed with lemon and lime juice, housemade chilli jam, extra virgin olive oil, finely diced jalapeno, shallots, coriander and mint. It’s piled around glass noodles dressed in tamarind laksa sauce: A blend of belachan, candlenuts, dried chilli, galangal, ginger flower, shallots, turmeric, laksa leaves, lemongrass, tamarind skins and tamarind pulp. Topping it all off is a little quenelle of housemade shrimp paste ice cream, which subtly melts its richness into the cold, fresh mix. STANDING UP TO THE HEAT Having female culinary mentors during her formative years likely provides essential inspiration for this young leader as she holds her own in an industry that is largely male dominated. “I’m probably very lucky. In all the kitchens I’ve been in, there has never been any worry about what I can or cannot do,” said Su, who began her gastronomic career at the age of 19 at Stellar at 1-Altitude, then did stints at Pollen and Esquina. She added, with a smile: \"It’s also because I’m a giant, maybe. I’m big enough to lift things and man the grill.” And, at 1.8m tall, “I think I’m big enough to scare people\". That said, she certainly doesn’t believe that it’s all about size, much less about gender. “My female colleagues are usually put into the cold kitchen, or dessert and pastry because ladies are known to have very soft, gentle hands, and wanting to advance to lifting heavy pots and the hot grill presents challenges,” she said. That’s not so in her kitchen. “I have a girl who’s very small. She’s on the grill now, in Botanico, and she’s enjoying it.” That’s because Su believes in supporting people in the pursuit of their passions. “I think the most important things are support, encouragement and positive vibes,” she said. “I always put myself in their shoes… If you have a heart for what you do, they will feel it.” Although she does run a tight ship when it comes to discipline and will chew people out if they have a bad attitude, she’s also the first one up for a prank. “The one I pull most often is wrapping the tap in cling film,” she giggled, slightly sheepishly. “When you are busy, the first thing you want to do is wash your hands – but, whoosh! You can try that – it’s so annoying.

On Aug 11, Yeo’s Mandarin thriller about the disappearance of a migrant Chinese construction worker at a Singapore land reclamation site took home the grand prize for Best Film at the 71st edition of one of the world’s most respected film festivals.  The Golden Leopard top prize is worth 90,000 Swiss francs (S$120,000). The film also clinched the first prize at the festival’s Junior Jury Awards, plus a Special Mention from the Ecumenical Jury (for “sensitising the viewer to religious, people-related, and social values\"). In addition, independent critics presented A Land Imagined’s lead actress, Luna Kwok, with the Boccalino d’Oro Prize for Best Actress. Yeo told CNA Lifestyle that his mind “just went completely blank” when he first heard that he had won. After all, there were heavyweights in the competition, including well-received features by filmmakers Hong Sang-soo, Radu Muntean and Kent Jones.  “After the initial shock, I was overwhelmed at the thought that people really cared about a film like ours, and that all our hard work is finally being recognised,” he shared. “I was just really, really touched.” “It signals to me that times have changed and maybe the world is now ready to hear our stories,” said Yeo, who wanted this film to showcase the people he felt he needed to represent in Singapore. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WIN Winning at Locarno is a massive achievement for the avant-garde auteur. The first edition was held in 1946, making it the first international film festival to take place after World War II. And while Locarno may be not as famously familiar as fellow festivals such as Cannes or Venice, it has made a name for itself in the international film community by serving as a hotbed for innovative, art house films, with entries that embrace new forms or ideas about cinema. Roberto Rossellini's 1945 Italian classic Rome, Open City and 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar winner The Lives of Others by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck are examples of such edgy filmmaking that have won big at Locarno. NO LOVE FOR HOMEGROWN FILMS? Reactions among the Singapore film community have been effusive, signalling the importance of this win for the local industry. Fellow filmmaker Tan Pin Pin celebrated Yeo’s win on Facebook, writing: “The grand prize, not sure if the powers that be understand how big this is!” Which lead us back to the perennial question: Must Singaporean filmmakers first win awards abroad before getting recognised in one’s own home country? \"It seems to be the case,\" said Yeo. \"But cinema culture here in Singapore is at a very young stage. It's maybe hard to understand the appreciation and relevance without setting it within a larger context.\" \"That said, I think all cinema made with sincerity is unique and deserving of its own way of spectatorship. It is important that a piece of work is appreciated by the local viewer it addresses, and having recognition from the international community helps to give it a certain perspective that might be lacking otherwise,\" he continued. FORMING RIPPLES Ultimately for Yeo, the greatest reward for winning at Locarno is to know “that what we have achieved here is something that will form ripples and have larger implications on cinema from this part of the world\". \"I am heartened to hear some filmmaker friends from Singapore and the region who felt that my winning the grand prize in a top festival is a sign that a larger international audience is now interested in hearing our stories and feel encouraged to make their own films,\" he said. So, exactly how important is a win like this for Singapore film? “I hope it is important,” said Yeo. “We can't just always celebrate our thriving economy. I think it's time people look our way and see the dedication and sophistication in our arts. But before that can happen, we need to be able to embrace our own and care for the health of our arts here.” And the chance to do so will be when A Land Imagined gets a theatrical release in Singapore. It will “definitely” be screened locally, according to Yeo, with exact release dates still being discussed. “It shouldn’t be for too long now,” he shared. “It's a film dedicated to this land, made for my audience here, and I hope it starts a conversation – not elsewhere but here”.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/yeo-siew-hua-land-imagined-locarno-film-festival-grand-winner-10633608"}, {"datetime": "20 Aug 2018 11:06PM", "tags": ["crime", "sexual assault"], "author": "", "title": "Man arrested for allegedly molesting 9-year-old girl", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 20-year-old man was arrested on Monday (Aug 20) for allegedly molesting a nine-year-old girl, police said.

In his National Day Rally speech, Mr Lee said that the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) will be expanded to cover more Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, to include those that were built up to 1997. In addition, every HDB flat can expect to be upgraded twice during their 99-year lease, under the new HIP II scheme. The second round of upgrading will take place when the flats are about 60 to 70 years old. This will create greater assurance for people who may want to buy older flats, said PropNex Realty's key executive officer Lim Yong Hock. \"It gives people a little bit more confidence to buy the older flats, especially those who intend to buy and live there till they die,\" said Mr Lim. \"They know that even if they were to buy an older flat, five to 10 years down the road, HDB will still do the home improvements.” “But there will still be other considerations - these could be location for example, the renovation (costs), and last but most importantly, the price,” he added. However, for older flats to be attractive to buyers, there needs to be some changes to the Central Provision Fund (CPF) Withdrawal Limit, Mr Lim noted. Currently, if the remaining lease of a property is less than 60 years, there are restrictions on how much CPF money can be used to buy it. A home owner can use CPF money if his age plus the number of years left on the lease is at least 80 years – but subject to restrictions. However, if the remaining lease is less than 30 years, CPF cannot be used at all. \"Younger buyers may not be able to use up to the full (amount of CPF),\" said Mr Lim. \"So this becomes a constraint, unless there are more changes and adjustments, then you may be able to see more younger buyers purchasing older flats.\" ADDRESSING THE 99-YEAR LEASE WORRY UNDER VERS Another housing scheme that was announced by Mr Lee is the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). The Government will buy back older flats before the 99-year leases run out and compensate residents whose flats are taken back early. Residents, who have to vote for VERS, can then use the proceeds to buy a new flat. The scheme could ease concerns about the value of older flats. \"A lot of owners were afraid that when the tail end of the lease comes, nobody will buy the flat from them and they would be forced to return the flats and end up with nothing,\" said Mr Chris Koh, director of property firm Chris Koh International. \"At least now, owners who have old flats know that there is some future ... You have options now instead of staying in your flat till the end.\" There remains the question of how much home owners would get in return if they choose to go for VERS. PM Lee had already said that the terms will be less generous than that of the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), as there will be “less financial upside”. \"People are going to decline if they feel that the pricing isn't attractive enough or they feel that if they accepted the price, they don't have the financial ability to find another place,\" explained Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Associate Professor of Economics Walter Theseira. \"There's always this issue whether people feel they can find an appropriate replacement.\" Still, Ms Karen Chan, who lives in a 48-year-old three-room flat at Stirling Road with her parents, hopes there will be rehousing benefits similar to SERS, when VERS kicks in. \"I am quite surprised because I thought there would be no chance for us to be part of these schemes,\" Ms Chan said. \"I believe for the older generation - it would be good for them to have different options.\" NO IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON RESALE MARKET VERS will only start in about 20 years, when some flats reach 70 years old. Similarly, HIP II will be implemented in about 10 years’ time, which is why property analysts said the schemes are unlikely to have any immediate impact on the HDB resale market for now. “If VERS or HIP happened on Jan 1 next year - such a timeline can excite the people,\" said PropNex’s Mr Lim. \"Too long a time to wait means that there are too many uncertainties in the market.\" For Mdm Anbrijt Thakarsingh, who lives in a 43-year-old flat in Bukit Merah, she is already certain that she does not intend to sell her flat to the Government. She wants to pass it on to her children instead. \"What happens at the end of the 99-year lease is up to them,\" she said. \"I'm happy to stay for as long as we are around ... no matter how much money is being offered.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/vers-scheme-future-for-old-hdb-flats-experts-10634124"}, {"datetime": "20 Aug 2018 09:17PM", "tags": ["Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority", "food safety"], "author": "", "title": "AVA orders recall of Dumex Mamil Gold infant milk formula after detecting bacteria", "content": " SINGAPORE: Authorities have ordered the recall of Dumex Mamil Gold infant milk formula - Step 1 after detecting the Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria in samples of the milk powder.

Romanian Kiss Iosif, 40, and Frenchman David Weidmann, 37, had pleaded guilty earlier this month to a charge of assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct.  They had tried to leave Singapore with more than S$400,000 stuffed in their underwear, but were stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint. The case is linked to a scam last year in which cruise and leisure firm Oceanic Group was cheated when it brokered the sale of a vessel to a foreign buyer, whose identity was not disclosed in court documents. In September last year, Oceanic Group’s managing director Daniel Chui Mun Yew travelled to Paris to collect a deposit for the vessel. After receiving the deposit of what he thought was 3.5 million euros (S$5.6 million), Mr Chui instructed his employees to pay S$1.5 million as commission to the buyer's representatives - Iosif and Weidmann - who were both in Singapore. However, Mr Chui discovered later that the deposit had been paid with counterfeit notes. He instructed his staff to recall the S$1.5 million from the two men, but they could not and a police report was filed. According to court documents, Iosif and Weidmann were last August contacted by a person known only as Boris, to come to Singapore to collect cash. They were to hand the money over to another person and receive a commission of S$5,000 each in return. THE PAIR SPLIT THE MONEY AND TRIED TO FLEE After collecting the money from the Oceanic Group employee, Weidmann and Iosif returned to their hotel. Boris contacted them and told them to bring a sum of S$205,000 each to Malaysia. The remaining money was to be handed over to another person, Boris instructed, telling them to ensure there were no cameras where they were to pass the cash. The pair packed their bags and checked out of the hotel before going to City Square Mall. They handed over a suitcase containing S$1.08 million to a Dutch accomplice, Nikolic Predrag, who had been instructed to wait for them in a toilet there. That same day, Iosif and Weidmann hid more than S$200,000 each in their underwear and tried to take a coach bound for Malaysia. However, they were arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint and the money was recovered. Of the S$1.08 million that Predrag received, about S$738,000 was recovered after he was arrested along with another woman, French national Nikolic Dalida.

In 2009, he started a relationship with the girl's mother, after her marriage broke down, the High Court heard. Three years later in 2012, the couple moved into a rental flat in Tampines. The woman had a son and a daughter with the accused, but the boy died before he turned a year old. The couple lived in the flat with their surviving daughter, as well as the woman's own daughter. Apart from this, the accused was still married to another woman, whom he had a son with, and regularly stayed with them with his girlfriend's knowledge. He treated the victim like his own child and was a disciplinarian and father figure to her, court documents said. The sexual abuse began in June 2014, during the school holidays, when the accused was working as a despatch rider for courier service firm Koli Express. He would return home to rest during his lunch breaks before going back to work. He was usually by himself, but during the school holidays, the victim was also at home, while her stepsister was at a childcare centre. ABUSE BEGAN WITH A MASSAGE That month, the accused was on medical leave and stayed home. He asked the eight-year-old girl to massage his legs in the living room. She did so while watching a YouTube video on her phone. While massaging his legs, the girl unwittingly made contact with the accused's genitals over his boxer shorts. He became aroused and made her perform a sexual act on him. That same month, the accused asked the child to perform another sexual act on him without her consent. He then kissed her and molested her. The next day, the girl confided in a neighbour, telling her what had happened. Shocked, the neighbour asked her to repeat her account and recorded the conversation on her phone. She later played the recording for the girl's mother. The mother confronted the accused about the sexual abuse and he immediately confessed to it, begging for forgiveness. The girl's mother threw him out of the flat at first, but eventually relented and let him back in after the accused begged for her forgiveness. She did not report the matter to the police as her daughter did not report any further incidents after this. However, in February 2016, the girl's grandmother lodged a police report after discovering that the accused had hit the child and bruised her head. By this time, the grandmother was aware of the sexual abuse and was concerned that it was happening again. The child told the police that she had been molested and sexually penetrated over several occasions in 2014, and the accused was arrested in March 2016. PROSECUTION ASKS FOR 14 YEARS' JAIL, 15 STROKES OF CANE The man pleaded guilty on Monday. Deputy public prosecutor Winston Man asked for a sentence of 14 years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane, saying that it was a \"serious sexual assault against a young child\". \"It was not a one-off instance of offending,\" he said. \"It was only upon being confronted that he desisted.\" He said there was a clear abuse of trust, and that the child at eight years of age was \"even more defenceless and unwitting than a teenager\". \"There was also an element of persistence in this case, with no less than three separate incidents in June 2014 alone,\" said the prosecutor. The man's defence lawyer Dhanwant Singh asked for the minimum mandatory eight years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane. He said the case was \"exceptional\" in that the father-daughter relationship \"was repaired\" and \"remained intact\". \"Shortly after June 2014, the family unity was mended,\" said the defence. \"It was only in 2016 when the accused took steps to discipline the child that it was reported, the welfare officer stepped in, and the accused had to move out.\" He asked for a \"substantial discount\" on account of the accused's plea of guilt and genuine remorse, adding that the period of offending was \"for a short duration\". Judicial commissioner Audrey Lim said this was \"not a case that calls for the minimum mandatory sentence\". She said the victim was young and vulnerable, and had lived with the accused, who took the role of a father figure. After the sentence was passed, the accused asked for some time with the mother of the victim, who was present. VICTIM'S MOTHER ASKS JUDGE FOR LENIENCY She had written a letter to the judge asking for leniency, saying that the accused was a \"dutiful, loving, responsible father and son\". She wrote that she was \"really disappointed and heartbroken\" the day she found out about the incident, but said that the accused \"sincerely wants to change to be a good father\". \"He has done so much for the past few years to improve his life and has built a very good family bond with us,\" she wrote. \"Please give our children ... hope that we may live happily like before.

In a blog post following Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally speech on Sunday, Mr Wong said the move will “enable many more Singaporeans to benefit from the scheme”. “The LBS (Lease Buyback Scheme) is a good scheme but it only applies to those living in four-room or smaller HDB flats.

SHORTER-TERM MOVES Highlighting Mr Lee’s announcements on plans to upgrade older HDB flats and renew older HDB towns, Mr Wong said several shorter-term moves will be made to help seniors unlock the value of their HDB flats for retirement. For instance, he said his ministry is looking at ways to improve the liquidity of the resale market for older flats in order to facilitate \"right-sizing\". \"Currently, CPF can be used for the purchase of older HDB flats but subject to certain restrictions. These rules are meant to ensure that buyers purchase a home for life, without compromising their retirement savings.\" Mr Wong said his ministry is working with the CPF Board to review and update rules to provide more flexibility for buyers of shorter-lease flats while safeguarding their retirement adequacy.  He added that the Government is making significant moves on housing to prepare for the future “responsibly”. “These moves are the result of many months of intensive study by MND and HDB.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed plans for what is called the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) during his National Day Rally speech on Sunday.  Mr Lee said the scheme, which will kick in in about 20 years, is part of a long-term plan to allow the Government to progressively redevelop precincts. It will take place when the flats reach about 70 years of age, he added. Flat owners can vote for the Government to buy back their homes before their leases run out.  The deterioration in value of older flats and the difficulty in selling them have been in the spotlight recently. However, the issue with private en bloc may happen to VERS as well, Mr Yam said. \"Private en bloc - we’ve seen huge numbers of it over the last few years. But the issue with private en bloc may happen to VERS too, which is the acrimony that will come about, this idea of one group versus another, I want to stay, I don’t want to stay.\" While he acknowledged that details were scant, he raised several questions.  “What sort of percentile are you looking at? Are you looking at the same as the private sector? How do you address the concerns of those who, after going through the VERS, find that they have become in one way or another disenfranchised with this flat?” he asked.  He also raised concerns about how HDB will calculate the value of the homes, and how CPF monies will be returned.  “We didn’t go through so many cooling measures to try to dampen the private en bloc market so VERS can take over. You have to consider that private en bloc market is only 20 per cent. VERS will eventually perhaps affect 80 per cent,” he said. Mr Yam, however, acknowledged that VERS will go “some way” towards addressing the concerns of those who are in older flats today.  Fellow GPC member Saktiandi Supaat agreed that these details have to be addressed, but noted that given that the programme will kick in in about 20 years, there is time to iron out the details.  Ms Cheryl Chan said that the plan has to be well thought out and address several different aspects, like how the home was financed and the age group of the flat owners.  “There is always a possibility that you have arguments surrounding the sale,” she said. Deputy chairman of the GPC for National Development Chong Kee Hiong was positive about the new scheme.  He said that VERS will allow homeowners to get new flats with the latest technologies. “If you don't have VERS, residents only have one choice which is to sell their flats with remaining 20-over years of lease left, so this will help them,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-vers-scheme-could-bring-about-acrimony-among-residents-warns-10632016"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 11:27PM", "tags": ["Asian Games"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Asian Games swimming: No medal but Singapore youngsters impress on opening day", "content": " JAKARTA: Team Singapore finished the opening day of the swimming competition at the 2018 Asian Games without a medal but many of its young talents put up impressive displays at the Gelaro Bung Karno (GBK) Aquatic Centre in Jakarta on Sunday night (Aug 19).  The women’s 4x100m freestyle team just missed out on a medal after finishing fourth in the final behind teams from China, Japan and Hong Kong.  However, the quartet of Quah Ting Wen, Quah Jing Wen, Cherlyn Yeoh and Christie Chue clocked 3:44.21s to break the national record for the event by 0.17s.  Jing Wen and Christie, both 18, and 17-year-old Cherlyn were all competing at the Asian Games for the first time.

These endeavours, Mr Lee said, are “fundamental commitments” by the Government to Singaporeans even as they require large expenditure and many years – “several generations and many General Elections” – to realise.    These come even as cost of living pressures are growing, driven by housing, education and health costs. “Housing, education and healthcare are three areas that the Government is very focused on,” he said. “We will spare no effort to ensure you can afford them.” Given that education, particularly pre-school education, figured prominently in his NDR speech last year, Mr Lee chose to focus on healthcare and housing this time round. EXTENDING CHAS, MORE POLYCLINICS For healthcare, one of the initiatives the Prime Minister unveiled was the extension of the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions regardless of their incomes.  CHAS entitles cardholders to subsidies for outpatient treatment at general practitioners (GPs), and it covers middle- and lower-income Singaporeans. Mr Lee cited the experience of People’s Action Party (PAP) MP Dr Lily Neo, who recounted how the elderly who may have put off seeing the doctor until the very last moment are coming to visit her earlier due to the scheme and allowing her to treat them before their conditions worsen. “CHAS has worked well,” the Prime Minister said, adding that everyone appreciates a little bit of help with regular medical bills for chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. He said CHAS benefits will continue to be tiered according to income, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will announce more details later. He also said the Government will be building more polyclinics across Singapore. MOH has been building and upgrading polyclinics and medical centres across the island, such as those in Punggol, Kampung Admiralty and Ang Mo Kio, and there will be such healthcare facilities in Sembawang, Eunos, Kallang and Bukit Panjang by 2020, he said. Furthermore, Nee Soon Central and Tampines North will also have polyclinics by 2023, he added. “So we will have more affordable, accessible, high-quality primary care all over Singapore,” Mr Lee said. HONOURING THE “MERDEKA GENERATION” Besides specific healthcare initiatives, the Prime Minister was also keen to remember another group of Singaporeans who have contributed significantly to nation-building: Those who were born in the 1950s, or the “Merdeka Generation”, of which there are 500,000 today. Mr Lee recognised that when the Government introduced the Pioneer Generation Package in 2014 for those born in 1940 or earlier, Singaporeans who are a little younger would have just missed out. It did give those who were born between 1950 and 1959 annual Medisave top-ups of S$100 or S$200 but “a Medisave top-up is not quite the same thing as the Pioneer Generation Package”, he added. As most of those in the Merdeka Generation are in their 60s today, and will have either left the workforce or will soon be retiring, Mr Lee said this group will be looking at their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings and Medisave accounts and worry about having enough for their medical needs as they age. “I think we owe something to them,” he said. As such, he announced the Government will work out a Merdeka Generation Package, which will help this group meet their medical expenses. It will cover similar areas as the Pioneer Generation Package such as outpatient subsidies, Medisave top-ups, MediShield Life premium subsidies and payouts for long-term care. He added that the Government will set aside a “significant sum” for the package, with more details to be announced next year. “The benefits will not be as large as for the Pioneer Generation, who had much less advantage in life,” Mr Lee said. “But the Merdeka Generation Package will go some way to relieve their healthcare worries. “And more importantly, it will show our appreciation for the Merdeka Generation and their contributions.” IMPROVING EXISTING HOMES The Prime Minister also noted that housing is another area that many Singaporeans are concerned about and, unlike healthcare, is not a “simple matter of keeping prices down because house prices affect different people differently”. He explained why the ​​​​​​​Government has decided on the 99-year leases for Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, and not make them freehold. “We need to be fair to future generations. HDB sells you the flat for 99 years. You own it, and you can pass it on for one or two more generations,” he said. “After that, the flat comes back to the state, the Government redevelops the land and builds new flats for future generations. “This is the only way to recycle the land and ensure that all our descendants can buy new Build-to-Order (BTO) flats of their own.” He went on to reveal plans to extend the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) for public housing built up to 1997, meaning another 230,000 flats will benefit from the scheme. The towns that would benefit include Pasir Ris, Yishun, Tampines and Jurong. The original scheme covered flats built up to 1986. Mr Lee said HIP has been “very popular” as homeowners get maintenance fixes to issues like spalling concrete, ceiling leaks and damaged pipes. Electricity supply will also be upgraded, as more families have air-conditioners, washing machines and, now, personal mobility devices. The scheme is heavily subsidised, with the Government paying up to 95 per cent of the cost and residents paying as little as a few hundred dollars, he pointed out, adding home prices usually go up after the improvements are made. The Prime Minister added that after the HIP, flats should be good for another 30 or 40 years, which means they will be about 60 or 70 years old before they show their age again. “We are determined not to let our public housing degenerate into ragged, squalid slums, which has happened in many other cities,” Mr Lee said, announcing the inception of a second round of upgrading called HIP II. The first flats will reach 60 to 70 years old about 10 years from now, and that's when they will launch the project.  “In short, every HDB flat can expect to be upgraded twice during their lease.” This second upgrading round is a “huge financial commitment” for the Government, with the first HIP costing more than S$4 billion. The Prime Minister said the second round will probably cost even more than that as the flats will be twice as old by then. He said HIP II is a “well justified” cost though, and the Government will do it so long as the Ministry of Finance has the money. CASHING OUT EARLIER Mr Lee went on to acknowledge the concerns of homeowners who want to move out of their existing flats and get on the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). He said SERS is a very good scheme for estate rejuvenation but it is very limited in that it targets selected HDB blocks or precincts that have high development value yet to be unlocked. HDB estimates that only around 5 per cent of flats are suitable for SERS, and while there will be a few more such projects to come, many have already been done. That said, he revealed that more households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their 99-year leases are up. This will be done through a new Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) for when a flat hits age 70 and above. Residents in the precinct will have to vote for VERS, just like for HIP. If residents vote for it, the Government will buy back the flats and residents can use the proceeds to help pay for another flat, he explained. If they vote not to go for VERS, residents can continue to live in their flats until their leases run out, he added. He also stressed that VERS is a long-term plan and not one that will start for another 20 years, when the first precincts start reaching that age threshold. “We need the time to work out how to choose the precincts, how to pace the redevelopment out, the specific terms of the Government’s offer and so on,” Mr Lee said. “We also need to study how to afford VERS for the long term. “But I think such a scheme is necessary, and we will start planning for VERS now.” A “NATION OF BOUNDLESS OPPORTUNITIES” Mr Lee highlighted how the Government is planting the seeds now in terms of conceiving the plans, investing the resources and building the institutions, even though some of the benefits will only be felt generations later. “Very few countries can make such long-term plans and anticipate needs and opportunities into the distant future. But in Singapore, we can and we will,” he said. “This Government believes it owes it to you to look ahead, share our thinking with you, pool our ideas and work it out with you to make it happen.” He cautioned that the plans will not unfold exactly as predicted as nobody can tell what will happen over the next half century – whether there will be war or peace, technological disruptions or if countries big and small can work together. However, he said the Government knows what Singapore must strive for to give itself the best chances of success: A thriving economy and sound Government finances, political stability and outstanding leadership, and staying a united people and working together to build a better Singapore. “With what we now have, we can achieve so much more together,” Mr Lee said. “One hundred years from now, Singapore should stand out not just for its modern skyscrapers and world rankings, but for being a nation of boundless opportunities.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-ambitious-housing-healthcare-plans-in-the-works-10631432"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 09:35PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "Chew Hui Min", "title": "National Day Rally 2018: The 8 things you need to know", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled plans to upgrade and redevelop Singapore’s public housing, and measures to help Singaporeans manage healthcare costs in the National Day Rally on Sunday evening (Aug 19). In addition to addressing the cost of living, Mr Lee devoted a large part of his speech to housing concerns and revealed two major schemes to renew Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats. He also announced major changes to healthcare financing: A new healthcare subsidy package for Singaporeans born in the 1950s and the expansion of the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Here are 8 key takeaways from the rally: 1. VOLUNTARY EARLY REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME Addressing Singaporeans’ concerns about the 99-year leases of HDB flats running out in a few decades’ time, Mr Lee announced a new scheme to redevelop HDB flats, that will be implemented in about 20 years’ time. The Government plans to start redeveloping older housing estates and will begin doing so when the flats are about 70 years old, Mr Lee said.  This will be done progressively over a period of 20 to 30 years so that old towns can be rejuvenated in an \"orderly way\". Under the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS), residents in a precinct will have to vote to allow authorities to take back the flats. Those who do so will receive compensation, but this will be less generous than under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). Mr Lee also explained at length the reasons why HDB flat leases should not extend beyond 99 years. 2. HOME IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME More HDB flats will be upgraded as the Government expands the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) to homes built from 1987 to 1997. The programme originally covered flats built in the years up to 1986. Another 230,000 flats will benefit, including in estates like Pasir Ris, Yishun, Tampines and Jurong, Mr Lee said. HDB will also be upgrading older flats a second time at around the 60- to 70-year mark under a HIP II scheme, which will start in 10 years’ time. 3. MERDEKA GENERATION PACKAGE The Government will work out a Merdeka Generation Package which will help Singaporeans born in the 1950s with healthcare costs. The package will cover outpatient subsidies, Medisave top-ups, MediShield Life premium subsidies and payouts for long-term care for about 500,000 Singaporeans. The benefits will not be as extensive as those for the pioneer generation, who benefitted from the Pioneer Generation Package launched four years ago, Mr Lee said. The Merdeka package will help to relieve some of the healthcare worries of Singaporeans now in their 60s, he added. 4. MORE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS Medical subsidy programme CHAS will be extended to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions regardless of income, Mr Lee announced. However, the benefits will continue to be tiered according to income. The scheme currently provides subsidies to those in the pioneer generation, lower- and middle-income households for outpatient medical and dental care. The Ministry of Health will announce details of the changes later. 5. MORE POLYCLINICS More polyclinics will be built in Sembawang, Eunos, Kallang and Bukit Panjang by 2020; and in Tampines North and Nee Soon Central by 2023. “Some of these are to upgrade and improve existing ones, but we will make sure that there are affordable, accessible, high-quality primary healthcare services all over Singapore,” Mr Lee promised. 6. GEYLANG SERAI Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman has been appointed to lead a project to make Geylang Serai a culturally distinctive precinct. This includes the area stretching from the Tanjong Katong Complex to Kampong Ubi Community Centre. Dr Maliki will engage the Malay community and other Singaporeans to solicit ideas and make recommendations to the Government, Mr Lee said in his Malay speech. 7. COST OF LIVING The Government will ensure that the major costs of living – HDB housing, healthcare and education are affordable, Mr Lee said in his Mandarin speech. It is also helping to manage the cost of living by building more hawker centres. He pointed out that lifestyle changes, such as the prevalence of smartphones, eating out and a higher quality of life in general have contributed to cost of living pressures. “While the Government will do its part to alleviate people’s cost of living concerns, each of us also has a responsibility to 'look after our own wallets' – save water, save electricity and at the same time, shop around for the best prices and be a smart consumer,\" he said. 8.

The Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) is part of a “long-term plan” to allow the Government to progressively redevelop precincts, Mr Lee said in his National Day Rally speech. It will take place when the flats reach about 70 years of age, he added. Mr Lee said that the Government will compensate residents whose flats are taken back early, and will also help them get another flat to live in, just as they would if their leases had run out. But the terms will be less generous than that of the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), as there will be “less financial upside”. Hence, he said, the scheme will be voluntary, and residents would have to vote for VERS, just like they currently do for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). “If the residents vote yes, we will proceed,” he explained. “The Government will buy back the whole precinct, all the flats and redevelop it, and residents can use their proceeds to help pay for another flat.” “If the residents vote no, then they can continue to live in their flats until their leases run out.” However, Mr Lee said that the Government will need time to work out the details of the scheme, such as how to select the precincts, pace the redevelopments out and the specific terms of the Government’s offer. He added that they also need to study how to afford VERS for the long term. Hence, the scheme will not start for another 20 years, although planning for it will begin now, he said. \n\n\n\n\n NEED FOR REDEVELOPMENT TO BE STAGGERED In explaining the rationale for the new scheme, Mr Lee said that the Government has good reason to take back more flats, and redevelop them as they grow older, before their 99-year leases are up. He added that when HDB towns grow older and the leases in the estates are nearing expiry, it is necessary to also redevelop the towns. The Government, he said, wants to do this in an orderly way.  He explained that HDB often built in a “tremendous rush” in the early years due to the housing shortage, and several older HDB estates, such as Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok, were built within short periods. “If we do not plan ahead, 99 years later, all the leases in such towns will expire around the same time, and all the flats will be returned to the state in a few years,” he said. “We will have to find new homes for a lot of people at once, and HDB will have to tear down and rebuild all the old flats in a hurry, just like when we first built Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok,” he added. “I don’t think this is a good idea”, he said. “The towns will become construction sites all over again, with cranes all over the place.” Hence, Mr Lee said old towns should be redeveloped progressively, over 20 to 30 years, rather than within 4-5 years. \"And that means starting from when the oldest flats reach about 70 years old onwards,\" he said.  \"So some flats, you redevelop when they get to 70 years old, some 75, some 80, and you stretch it out over 20-30 years, and progressively, do things in a measured and considered way.\"  SERS LIMITED TO ABOUT 5 PER CENT OF FLATS  In his speech, Mr Lee pointed out that SERS is a very good scheme for estate rejuvenation. But he noted it is a “very limited scheme”, and HDB estimates that only about 5 per cent of flats are suitable for SERS. The issue of the lease expiry of older HDB flats has been in the spotlight recently, following a blog post last year by National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. He had said that SERS is, as its name implies, done on a selective basis, and said that home owners should not automatically assume that all old HDB flats would be eligible for it.  More recently, amid concerns about the impact of lease expiry on HDB resale prices, Mr Wong said in Parliament that there is still value in older HDB flats that can be unlocked for retirement.  Mr Lee said that there will be a few more SERS projects to come, but many projects with high redevelopment potential have already been done. He explained that SERS is meant for selected HDB blocks or precincts which have high development value that can be unlocked. Tanglin Halt, which is being redeveloped through SERS, is one such example.  But it was not built optimally, and the precincts, he said, were not always well laid out: There are low-rise flats, large surface car parks, many empty spaces and odd leftover areas. He said that in cases such as Tanglin Halt, it makes economic sense for the Government to take back the flats early and redevelop the site. “Because there is a lot of value unlocked, we share this value with residents through generous compensation,” he said. “And with generous compensation, we can make the acquisition compulsory.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-scheme-planned-to-redevelop-more-old-hdb-flats-before-10631458"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 09:10PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "NDR 2018: Expanded home improvement scheme to spruce up another 230,000 HDB flats", "content": " SINGAPORE: Another 230,000 flats will be upgraded as the Government looks to extend the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) to HDB blocks built in the years up to 1997, announced Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 19).  The expanded programme will also include a new component dubbed HIP II, which will give all HDB flats a second round of upgrading when they reach the 60 to 70-year mark.  These were announced in Mr Lee’s National Day Rally speech, in which he also talked about why HDB flat leases should not extend beyond 99 years.  Rolled out in 2007 to fix common maintenance problems at ageing HDB flats, the HIP scheme originally covered flats built in the years up to 1986 and those that had not undergone the previous Main Upgrading Programme (MUP).  It is heavily subsidised and the Government pays up to 95 per cent of upgrading costs.  As of Aug 1, HIP has been announced for about 242,000 of the close to 320,000 eligible flats, according to HDB. Upgrading works have been completed for 122,000 homes, with work underway in the remaining flats.  Mr Lee said the final batch of flats that qualify for this scheme will be announced by next year. When completed, a total of 450,000 flats will be upgraded under HIP and the MUP.  \n\n\n\n\n However, there are homes that missed qualifying for the HIP and are now starting to show their age, said Mr Lee.  For instance, estates like Yishun, Tampines and Jurong had flats that were built before and after 1986. There are also residents in Pasir Ris who collected keys to their flats in 1987.  “I know many HDB residents in these younger flats are also hoping for an upgrading.”  The expanded programme to include homes built between 1987 and 1997 will address this, said Mr Lee.  “After upgrading, these flats should be good for another 30 to 40 years. By that time, the flats will be 60 to 70 years old and i expect they will be showing their age again.”  So as to not let Singapore’s public housing “degenerate into ragged, squalid slums”, the HDB will be upgrading older flats a second time at around the 60 to 70-year mark under the HIP II scheme.  This will start in about 10 years’ time when the first flats reach 60 to 70 years old.  \n\n\n\n\n “HIP II will keep the flats safe and liveable, and also help them retain their value as their leases run down,” he said. “It should see the flats through to the end of their leases.”  “So in short, every HDB flat can expect to be upgraded twice during their lease.”  Mr Lee said the HIP II scheme is a “huge financial commitment”. The first HIP will cost the Government more than S$4 billion and the HIP II is expected to cost even more as the flats will be twice as old by then. But this is “well-justified” and will be done “so long as the Ministry of Finance has the money\", said Mr Lee.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-expanded-home-improvement-scheme-to-spruce-up-another-10631124"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 09:04PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018", "HDB"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "NDR 2018: Why are HDB leases 99 years long? PM Lee explains", "content": " SINGAPORE: The ongoing discussions surrounding Singapore’s public housing shelf life were tackled by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 19). Over 80 per cent of the population reside in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats - of which an increasing number are nearing the halfway mark of their 99-year leases, sparking both public and parliamentary questions about issues such as depreciating value and notions of home ownership. “There is one fundamental reason why,” said PM Lee on the issue of 99 year leases. “We need to be fair to future generations …  After (99 years), the flat comes back to the state, the Government redevelops the land, and builds new flats for future generations. This is the only way to recycle the land, to ensure all our descendants can buy new BTO (Build-To-Order) flats of their own. “If instead the Government sold you the flat on freehold … Sooner or later we would run out of land to build new flats.” He continued: “The owners would pass down the flat to some of their descendants ... Those not lucky enough to inherit a property would get nothing. Our society would be split into property owners and those who cannot afford a property. That would be most unequal, and socially divisive.”  This is why 99-year leases extend to private housing as well, said PM Lee. “There is also a practical reason why we can't extend the leases,” he added. “If you look at older buildings today, some look rather worn, even before they are 50 years old. After a century, I am sure the mechanical and electrical systems will be obsolete. The concrete will have deteriorated in our tropical climate. “And even if we could fix all that, the recurrent maintenance costs would be very high.” “So it is better to let the leases expire, take the blocks back, demolish, rebuild afresh ... newer, better, more liveable flats, blocks, townships - more suited to what our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will want to live in,” PM Lee said. “VERY FEW OF TODAY'S HDB OWNERS WILL OUTLIVE THEIR LEASES” Earlier, he also said that “actually, 99 years is a very long time”. “Let’s say you buy a new flat from HDB in your early 30s. After 99 years, you will be 130-plus years old - and I would guess you probably won’t need this flat anymore. If you have children, they will also be very old, almost as old as the flat itself, in their 80s or 90s. And if you have grandchildren, by then, your grandchildren will be grandparents.” said PM Lee. “When you retire after living in your flat for 30 or 40 years, the flat will still have a good 60 plus years of lease left. And that's long enough for it to retain substantial value, and be a good retirement nest egg.” He said retirees in such a situation could explore options such as to continue living in the flat, rent out a room for income if needed, and one day pass it down to their children. They could also “right-size” by selling the flat and moving to a smaller unit, or tap into the Lease Buyback scheme by returning the remaining lease to HDB. The Ministry of National Development is also working on helping residents monetise their older flats by expanding the Lease Buyback scheme or improving the liquidity of the resale market, said PM Lee. “Very few of today’s HDB owners will outlive their leases. HDB estimates that it will happen to less than two per cent of households,” he noted. “So it's not likely to happen to you. \"It could happen to your children if they inherit your flat. But this shouldn't be a problem if your children buy their own BTO flat, with its own 99-year lease, as many do. Because then an inheritance for them would be a gift and a bonus.” As for resale flats, with Singapore's oldest flats at most 52 years old, it leaves at least another 47 years on the lease - “still quite a long time”, PM Lee reiterated. He then said not to worry over exactly what will happen when a flat’s lease is up and it has to be returned to the state. “The Government will help you to get another flat to live in,” PM Lee promised. “It may be a BTO flat from HDB with a fresh 99-year lease … It may be a resale flat on a shorter and cheaper lease. Or it may be a two-room Flexi flat for retirement - different options depending on your needs and what you can afford.” “But whichever option you choose, you will have to pay for the lease,” he warned. “This is only fair, because you bought the original flat knowing when the lease would run out, and knowing that the flat would then have to be returned to HDB.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-hdb-lease-99-years-flat-national-day-rally-10631442"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 08:50PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "NDR 2018: ‘Merdeka Generation’ healthcare package for Singaporeans born in ’50s", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 19) announced a Merdeka Generation Package to help with the medical expenses of some 500,000 Singaporeans born in the 1950s. Speaking at the 2018 National Day Rally, he said details will be announced next year but the package – to be implemented using “a significant sum” - will include the likes of outpatient subsidies, Medisave top ups, premium subsidies for the MediShield Life insurance scheme and payouts for long term care. These are similar areas covered by the S$8 billion Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) launched in 2014 to assist with healthcare costs. \n\n\n\n\n So far more than S$1.3 billion has been spent on the PGP to help approximately 450,000 of these “pioneers”, said PM Lee. “We have taken special care of elderly Singaporeans,” he added. “When we introduced the PGP, we knew that Singaporeans a little younger than the pioneers would just miss out ... We have not forgotten this group.” For this generation, which the 66-year-old Prime Minister said he was “proud” to be part of, the meaning of the Malay word “Merdeka” - liberation, freedom, independence - holds significance. “They lived through the tumultuous years of the '50s and the early '60s,” he explained, citing political milestones such as the departure from British colonial rule, the formation of Government in 1959, merger and separation with Malaysia, and eventual independence. “WE OWE SOMETHING TO THEM” The prime minister described the Singaporeans born in the 1950s as having lived through “battles and upheavals” and also witnessing how their parents “scraped and slogged” for them. “They understood instinctively what was at stake … The men were among the earliest batches called up for National Service. They were the first of the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) - the Army, Navy and Air Force,” he added. “Many, especially the girls, didn't complete their education. They came out to work early, to support the family and younger siblings. “Some joined the workforce amidst economic uncertainty and high unemployment, as the British Forces withdrew from Singapore. All started working when wages were still low.”  PM Lee noted that most of the Merdeka Generation today would be in their 60s. “They have either left the workforce, or will soon be retiring,” he said. “Many have similar healthcare concerns as the pioneers. They are looking at their CPF (Central Provident Fund) savings and Medisave accounts, worried about having enough for their medical needs as they grow older. “I think we owe something to them.” But PM Lee cautioned that their benefits would not be as large as for the pioneers, who had “much less advantage in life”. “They (the Merdeka Generation) were born later, they benefitted from an extra decade of economic growth. And they were generally better educated than the Pioneers, especially the younger ones,” he explained. “The Merdeka Generation earned more over their lifetimes, and accumulated more CPF savings, because in the early '80s, wages increased sharply, CPF rates also went up significantly.” Still, the new Merdeka Generation Package will “go some way” to relieve the healthcare worries of these Singaporeans, PM Lee summed up.  “More importantly, it will show our appreciation for the Merdeka Generation and their contributions.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-merdeka-generation-package-national-day-rally-10631436"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 08:42PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018", "CHAS", "health"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "NDR 2018: CHAS to be extended to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, regardless of income", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) will soon cover Singaporeans with chronic conditions regardless of their income, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed in his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 19). The Ministry of Health (MOH) will reveal more details at a later stage, Mr Lee said, adding that the benefits will be tiered according to income. “We want all Singaporeans to have access to affordable, high quality healthcare,” he added. “No one should be denied medical care because they cannot afford it.” \n\n\n\n\n And as Singapore’s population ages, Mr Lee said more people will have chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. Asthma, dementia, osteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease are some examples of chronic conditions listed by the MOH. There are a total of 20 conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme. At last year’s National Day Rally, Mr Lee stressed the importance of tackling diabetes in the country, highlighting that one in nine Singaporeans has the disease. “But we can continue to live a full life if we manage these conditions – by taking good care of ourselves, eating healthily, taking our medications regularly and following up with our family doctor,” he said. “I think all of us will appreciate a little bit of help with the regular medical bills for such chronic conditions.” Currently, CHAS offers Singaporeans from lower- to middle-income households as well as those from the Pioneer Generation subsidies for their medical and dental care at participating clinics. And the scheme, which was introduced in 2012, has worked well, Mr Lee said. Jalan Besar Member of Parliament Lily Neo, who is also a general practitioner, has been seeing more elderly patients since then, he added. “She said that our old folks are very resilient and generally put off seeing the doctor until they cannot tahan (stand it) anymore,” he added. “But because of CHAS, they now come to her earlier, because now, she can treat them before their conditions worsen.” Mr Lee also gave an update on the new polyclinics that will be built islandwide. Sembawang, Eunos, Kallang and Bukit Panjang will have new polyclinics by 2020, he revealed, while Nee Soon Central and Tampines North will get them by 2023. \n\n\n\n\n “We will make sure we have affordable, accessible, high quality primary care all over Singapore,” he said. Mr Lee opened the new Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic in June, noting that it is “bigger and better, with more and improved services”. “In fact, Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic has become so popular that the staff told me they are getting ‘medical tourists’,” he said. “Not from overseas, but they come from Yishun, and even Bedok and Jurong.” Added Mr Lee: “All of you are very welcome in Ang Mo Kio, but actually you don’t have worry, because we are building more polyclinics across Singapore.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-chas-subsidy-scheme-singaporeans-chronic-conditions-10631428"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 08:30PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018", "Malaysia", "HSR", "trade war"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "NDR 2018: Fundamentals of Singapore’s relationship with Malaysia have not changed, says PM Lee ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore and Malaysia are closely bound by ties of kinship and history, geography and economics, and the fundamentals of Singapore’s relationship with its neighbour have not changed, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 19). In his National Day Rally speech, he stressed the need for both countries to work together to tackle common challenges, and find constructive ways to resolve differences when interests diverge. “If Singapore-Malaysia relations can stay stable and close, we can pursue win-win cooperation and we can each focus on our own domestic priorities,” he said. HIGH-SPEED RAIL, RTS LINK PROJECTS HAVE LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENTS  Mr Lee pointed out that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his team are determined to review and change many of the policies set by their previous government. But while he “appreciates their reasons”, he noted that some of their reviews affect Singapore’s ongoing projects with Malaysia, such as the High-Speed Rail (HSR) and Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link to Johor. After Dr Mahathir’s Pakatan Harapan coalition formed the new government in Malaysia after the country’s General Election in May, Malaysia took a stand to negotiate a deferment of the HSR project. “We entered into these two projects in good faith, after careful negotiations, because they benefitted both countries,” said Mr Lee, adding that both have legally binding bilateral agreements. “These set out clearly the duties of each party, and what happens if either party wants to change or to terminate the agreements,” he said. “Both sides have to carry out what has been agreed to, unless we mutually agree to vary the terms.” Dr Mahathir had also expressed displeasure with the 1962 Water Agreement, under which Singapore is given the full and exclusive right to draw up to a maximum of 250 million gallons of water per day from the Johore River. He had said that it was unfavourable to Malaysia, and wanted it renegotiated. Singapore subsequently said it will fully honour the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement and expects Malaysia to do the same. Speaking in Parliament earlier this month, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan reiterated Singapore’s “clear and consistent position” on the issue – something that Mr Lee also highlighted in his speech. “You know Singapore’s view – the Water Agreement is sacrosanct,” he said. “We must proceed strictly in accordance with its terms.” Nonetheless, Mr Lee said that Singapore has worked well with Malaysia over the years, and done “substantial projects with successive governments”. “I hope that with Dr Mahathir and his new team, we can build on our deep partnership, look ahead, and make further progress together,” he said.   Mr Lee was speaking about relations between Singapore and its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia. In the case of Indonesia, Mr Lee said he was worked well with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who will also be hosting him to their annual Leaders’ Retreat in Bali in October. “We will be discussing ways to do more together,” he said. WORLD SITUATION “MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN”, NEED TO STRENGTHEN ASEAN  In his speech, Mr Lee also stressed the importance of regional grouping ASEAN “in an uncertain world”, and work on relationships with all ASEAN partners. He said he hopes that the recent Trump-Kim Summit has helped to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but noted that Korea is not the only trouble spot in the world. Describing the world situation as “much more uncertain”, Mr Lee said that openness, globalisation and free trade have all come under pressure. The United States, for example, which used to promote free trade and the free movement of people, has now made “rebalancing trade” a top priority, he explained, and unilaterally imposed tariffs on imports from other countries. This includes the European Union, Canada, Mexico and especially China. These countries are retaliating and imposing their own tariffs on US exports. “This tit-for-tat affects business confidence, undermines the multilateral trading system, and threatens global prosperity,” he said. “There are no winners in a trade war.” “Small and open economies are especially vulnerable, and Singapore will suffer collateral damage.” But beyond economics, Mr Lee noted that world peace and stability are at risk, as the trade frictions have eroded trust, and sharpened tensions and rivalries between countries. The United States and Europeans, for example, have long been firm friends and allies, but are now “arguing fiercely” over trade and defence spending, he said. As for China and the US, Mr Lee said both powers have the “most important bilateral relationship in the world”. “They are interdependent, and they need to work closely together on global issues like climate change,” he said. “But the Trump Administration has named China as America’s ‘strategic competitor’, and President Xi Jinping has warned that China will punch back and will not ‘turn the other cheek’.” Mr Lee described this as an “unprecedented situation”, and a “turning point”. “We cannot be confident that the major powers will continue to work with one another, and that the existing international system which has held the world together for so long will still hold,” he said. “We do not know whether after a while, new rules and norms for international cooperation will form, or whether there will be prolonged tension and suspicion, mutual rivalries and hostile blocs.” “We hope all countries will act with restraint and wisdom, overcome the current challenges, and find a new way to move forward together,” he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-national-day-rally-singapore-malaysia-relations-10631434"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 07:37PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "NDR 2018: Singapore to nominate hawker culture as ‘intangible cultural heritage’ for UNESCO listing", "content": " SINGAPORE: Hawker culture will be nominated by Singapore for a possible listing on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Sunday (Aug 19) in his National Day Rally speech.  The list, which was developed in 2008, is made up of intangible cultural heritage elements from different countries that showcase the diversity of such things from around the world. This is with the aim of increasing their visibility and raising awareness about their importance so they can be safeguarded.  Speaking at the Institute of Technical Education College Central at Ang Mo Kio, PM Lee described hawker culture as a “cultural institution” that is a unique part of Singapore’s heritage and identity.  “Hawker centres are our community dining rooms,” said Mr Lee in his Chinese speech, noting how Singaporeans of all races, faiths and income groups are able to eat together in hawker centres.  Highlighting how hawker food remains the biggest draw for Singaporeans overseas and is the “best cure for homesickness”, he added: “Our hawker centres and hawker food resonate with many Singaporeans.”  Mr Lee said that Singaporeans approached during various consultations have expressed “widespread support” for the nomination.  “The UNESCO inscription will help to safeguard and promote this unique culture for future generations. It will also let the rest of the world know about our local food and multicultural heritage.”  Echoing that, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu said in a statement that hawker culture is an integral part of Singaporeans’ lives and is a reflection of the country’s multicultural heritage.  “Hawker culture is not just about the food. It is also about our hawker centres, being social and community spaces for people from all walks of life. It is also about our hawker food heritage, and the people behind the food - our hawkers. “I am very happy that there is widespread public support for it to be nominated to UNESCO,” she said.  Ms Fu said in March that Singapore is looking at the possible listing, and stressed that the chosen element has to be one that resonates with all Singaporeans and reflects its multicultural heritage.  The nomination will be spearheaded by the Federation of Merchants’ Associations, Singapore (FMAS), the National Environment Agency (NEA) as well as the National Heritage Board (NHB). The nomination documents will be submitted in March 2019, with the results expected in end 2020, said a joint press releases from the three organisations.  If successful, hawker culture will be Singapore’s first entry on the UNESCO list, joining the likes of batik from Indonesia, yoga in India as well as Malaysian Mak Yong theatre. WIDESPREAD POPULARITY  The selection of hawker culture was made after a series of public engagement efforts and focus group discussions earlier this year. Across these sessions, hawker culture was consistently highlighted as an intangible cultural heritage that best represents Singapore’s multicultural identity, said the release.  Three important characteristics of hawker culture were particularly highlighted in the focus group discussions – hawkers as dedicated masters of a trade, accessible hawker centres and hawker centres as a reflection of Singapore's multi-culture heritage, the release added.  These findings were similar to studies conducted in the past. For instance, a 2016 NEA study found that close to 85 per cent of respondents felt that hawker centres play an important role in community bonding. The same study also revealed that 9 in 10 respondents felt hawker centres are an integral part of Singapore’s identity.  “Hawker centres and hawker food have grown to become an integral part of the Singaporean identity, and is a reflection of our multi-cultural society,” said NHB chief executive officer Chang Hwee Nee. “Just as how our hawker centres bring people together through our shared love for food, I believe this nomination will help bond Singaporeans through the celebration of our living heritage, and make us feel even prouder to be Singaporean.  “Through the bid, we hope to put Singapore’s hawker culture on the world stage, thus increasing recognition of its importance, and ensuring its sustainability for the future.”  NEA CEO Ronnie Tay described hawker centres as “important communal spaces where people gather, interact and forge community bonds”.  “Recognising the key role that hawker centres play in the daily lives of Singaporeans, NEA will continue to work with all stakeholders to sustain the hawker trade and ensure that our hawker centres remain a popular and well-loved dining location amongst all Singaporeans,” Mr Tay added.  From now till end 2020, Singaporeans can pledge their support for hawker centres, hawkers and hawker food via www.oursgheritage.sg. There are also plans in October this year for public outreach initiatives such as a three-month travelling exhibition for Singaporeans to learn about hawker culture and support the nomination.  The exhibition will be held at more than 10 locations islandwide, including Our Tampines Hub, Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre and Yuhua Village Market, as well as selected libraries and shopping malls.  “Singapore’s nomination of hawker culture reflects the prized position that our hawker culture occupies in the hearts of Singaporeans,” said FMAS president Mr Yeo Hiang Meng. “We hope that more Singaporeans will actively pledge their support for our hawker culture. This will strengthen our bid and support its successful inscription on UNESCO’s Representative List.” HAPPY FOR THE RECOGNITION  Hawkers have welcomed the nomination, explaining that it provides much-needed recognition for their craft.  Others added that they are pleased that hawker culture can be showcased on a global stage.  Mr Alan Tan, who took over HarriAnns, his family’s Nonya Kueh and Teochew-style Glutinous rice business in 2013, said that the nomination is something for hawkers to be proud of.  He said: “I really think that with this nomination, hawkers can give themselves a pat on the back and say that ‘Hey, we’ve done it, we are proud of it’ and hawker centres can be put on the world’s culinary map.”  “It’s a good thing and can raise our profile,” added Mr Low Teck Seng, a second generation hawker who owns a stall selling soya bean milk at Tiong Bahru market. Mr Low took up the trade from his father, who started out as an itinerant hawker on Seng Poh Road.  “We feel very honoured by the nomination. Hopefully, those from outside Singapore can patronise our businesses as a result and business can get even better.”  He hopes that it will also encourage more young people to become hawkers. “My children are undecided on whether they will be taking over,” said Mr Low, who has a 28-year-old son and a 30-year-old daughter.  “It’s a difficult and arduous trade.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-singapore-nominate-hawker-culture-unesco-heritage-10631126"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 07:31PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "NDR 2018: Government will do its part to alleviate concerns about cost of living, says PM Lee", "content": " SINGAPORE: With Singaporeans still feeling the squeeze from rising cost of living, the Government will do its part to help alleviate these worries, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 19).  “People still feel cost of living pressures,” he said in his Chinese speech at the National Day Rally, where he highlighted four contributing factors to the worries about living costs despite Singapore seeing steady economic growth, low unemployment and higher wages.  “They sense that they have to spend more and that their earnings never seem to be quite enough.”  Mr Lee said the Government is looking at housing, education and healthcare costs “very closely” given that these major expenditure items are the top concerns among Singaporeans, especially young families and the sandwiched generation.  \"We will make sure that HDB housing, healthcare and education are affordable so Singaporeans do not have to worry about them.\" Meanwhile, price increases and an improved standard of living have also pushed up living costs.  Measures are in place to allay worries related to the rise in water and electricity prices, but Mr Lee said Singaporeans also have a responsibility to “look after (their) own wallets” amid lifestyle changes.  PRICE INCREASES The rise in prices of goods and services here can be attributed to inflation, which has been “relatively modest” according to statistics, said Mr Lee.  Singapore has also done better than most developed countries in terms of overall wage gains though this has not occurred across the board. “I know that not everyone’s wages grew,” said Mr Lee. “For some, their wages have stagnated. Others worry about losing their jobs because of economic restructuring. Some have lost their jobs but they are the minority fortunately.”  There are also retirees who no longer have incomes and are worried about their savings running out, he added.  “Therefore, for these Singaporeans, when prices increase ... they feel as if ‘their wallets have shrunk’.”  Mr Lee said the Government has tried to keep inflation low and prices stable, but it cannot completely prevent prices from increasing.  Water prices, for instance, have gone up for the first time in nearly 20 years following last year’s announcement of a 30 per cent hike that was implemented in two phases.  Mr Lee said the Government has put off the increase “for as long as (it) could” but it had to do it in the end given significant increases to the cost of producing clean water over the years, as well as the need to build more NEWater factories and desalination plants.  “Water will always be a precious resource for us, a strategic and security issue, as well as a sensitive foreign policy matter,” he said in his speech delivered at the Institute of Technical Education College Central in Ang Mo Kio. Moving on to the recent increase in electricity prices, Mr Lee said electricity tariffs today are actually lower compared to 2008 as he showed a chart that plotted the fluctuations of tariffs over the past 10 years. According to that chart, the electricity tariff stood at 25.07 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in the third quarter of 2008. Since then, it has gone up and down over the years and is now at 23.65 cents per kWh.  “Unfortunately, we all remember vividly when the electricity tariff goes up but when the tariff comes down, we forget quickly.”  With Singapore importing almost all of its energy, it cannot control electricity tariffs that track changes in global oil prices, said Mr Lee. On why the Government does not fix electricity tariffs, the prime minister explained that doing so will involve costly subsidies as Singapore is not an oil producing country.  “This is not financially sustainable in the long run,” he said.  In addition, having such a policy will mean that those who consume more electricity will receive more subsidies. With the well-to-do more likely to have higher consumption, subsiding the cost of electricity by fixing a low tariff is not the best way to help low-income families, Mr Lee said. The more effective way is to give direct subsidies to low-to-middle income families for their utilities bills, such as the U-Save rebates for all households living in HDB flats. \"I hope people will understand that we have adopted the best approach to lessen the burden of Singaporeans,\" he added. HIGHER SPENDING WITH LIFESTYLE CHANGES Lifestyle changes alongside economic growth and technological progress have also contributed to higher cost of living, said Mr Lee. Items that were once considered luxury items or did not exist before, such as air conditioners and smartphones, have now become daily necessities. People are also eating out more, while enjoying more entertainment and leisure options, he said. \"Our standard of living have gone up. That is a good thing because it means that our lives have improved. \"However to sustain this higher quality of life, people are spending more than before and that can put pressure on them,\" said Mr Lee. Handphones, for one, have completely changed lifestyles and how people communicate. With households doing away with landlines and every family member using a handphone, telecommunication bills have increased, with some low-income families having bills as much as S$300. This accounts for more than 10 per cent of their household incomes, said Mr Lee.  This compared to how telecommunications bill was about S$8 a month or S$100 a year in the 1990s, he added. Mr Lee also touched on how many young parents are concerned about the cost of infant milk formula in Singapore. For that, the Government has since set up a task force led by Senior Minister of State of Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon. The task force has attempted to tackle the issue in various ways, such as simplifying import processes, as well as bringing in more brands and parallel imports. Public hospitals have also begun offering more affordable brands, with private hospitals also coming on board. The Government has also indicated clearly that it will tighten regulations for the labelling of infant formula and put a stop to misleading advertising. Amid these initiatives, Mr Lee said the average price of formula milk has dropped. \"Through these efforts, there are now more reasonably priced options for consumers to choose from,\" he said.  \"More importantly, young parents are better informed. They are now able to make better choices, based on their needs and budget.\" Lastly, Mr Lee turned to how fewer families cook at home these days and are eating out more, given that it is more convenient especially for dual-income families. While this lifestyle change in completely understandable, he said it pushes up the cost of living. The Government will help Singaporeans manage the cost of eating out by building more hawker centres. Seven new centres have been built in the last few years and 13 more are on the way, he said. “Stalls in the new hawker centres are required to provide affordable food choices. Almost every stall will offer at least one economical meal option, priced at S$3 or less. “In other words when we tender out the hawker centres, we do not assess bids just on their tender price alone but also whether the operators can offer affordable options,\" said Mr Lee. But while the Government will do its part to alleviate concerns that people have about cost of living, Mr Lee said that Singaporeans also have a responsibility to look after their own wallets.  “Each of us has a responsibility to ‘look after our own wallets’ – save water, save electricity, and at the same time, shop around for the best prices and be a smart consumer,” he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government-cost-of-living-concerns-national-day-rally-2018-10631118"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 07:00PM", "tags": ["NDR 2018", "Geylang Serai", "Malay-Muslim community"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "NDR 2018: Geylang Serai to be made ‘culturally distinctive’, with enhanced night lights, more activity spaces", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Government will work with community stakeholders to make Geylang Serai more culturally distinctive, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said, as he revealed plans to make the place “even more vibrant and special”. In his Malay speech at the National Day Rally on Sunday (Aug 19), Mr Lee said “we can do more to make Geylang Serai a culturally distinctive precinct, stretching from the Tanjong Katong Complex to Kampong Ubi CC”. “WGS (Wisma Geylang Serai) can use the open field and car park next door for activities,” he added, referring to the new Malay-Muslim social, cultural and heritage hub beside the iconic Geylang Serai market. “We can beautify and coordinate night lighting, and turn the junction in front of WGS into a landmark to create a distinctive feel and sense of arrival.” South East District Mayor Maliki Osman, who is also Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs, will lead the project and work with local merchants, Government agencies and MESRA, the People’s Association’s Malay Activity Executive Committees Council. “He will also engage the Malay community and other Singaporeans to solicit ideas and make recommendations to the Government,” Mr Lee said. “I am sure that the next time I visit, Geylang Serai will be even more vibrant and special.” “WGS will be a centre for Malay activities, an icon that the community can be proud of,” he added. It will officially open in January 2019. The WGS will also host a joint-office for the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) and self-help group Mendaki, which Mr Lee described as a first step towards having Malay-Muslim organisations (MMO) work together and improve their services for the community. This new partnership, called M3, involves MUIS, Mendaki and MESRA combining their resources and volunteers and collaborating with the Government and other MMOs, Mr Lee said. “By doing so, they can make even more headway in tackling the challenges the community faces,” he explained. “These challenges include getting more young children to attend pre-school, empowering and mentoring youth, and supporting those who are left behind because of drugs or social problems.” In addition, the WGS will host a one-stop service centre jointly run by seven MMOs, including the Association of Muslim Professionals, Creative Malay Arts and Culture and Tabung Amal Aidilfitri, which collects donations and distributes them to the needy during Ramadan. This centre will serve multiple needs of the community and help improve the lives of residents, the Ministry of Communications and Information said in a statement on Sunday. “There is also opportunity for better collaboration on social assistance programmes and synergy to build better programmes for the community,” it added. Mr Lee called M3 a “positive development” that will need the community’s support to succeed. “Individually, each (organisation) continues to make major contributions to the community’s progress by looking after their cultural, religious, educational and social needs,” he said. “I hope more Malays will contribute to the community through M3, whether you are new volunteers or activists already in the mosques and various Malay-Muslim organisations.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-geylang-serai-culturally-distinctive-night-lights-10631186"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 06:30PM", "tags": ["HDB"], "author": "", "title": "HDB investigating after newspaper found stuffed within walls of flat", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) is investigating after a video surfaced online showing pieces of newspaper stuffed within the side walls of an HDB flat balcony.

He devoted a significant part of his speech to housing issues, addressing 99-year leases and announcing new schemes to rejuvenate Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats.  On healthcare, Mr Lee announced that medical subsidy programme CHAS will be extended to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, regardless of income. There will also be a new healthcare subsidy package for the \"Merdeka Generation\" - Singaporeans born in the 1950s.  Here are the highlights from the National Day Rally, which took place at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College Central campus in Ang Mo Kio. 9.29pm: Singapore can achieve more together Concluding, Mr Lee said 100 years from now, Singapore should stand out for being a nation of boundless opportunities. It should be “a society where every skill and talent is recognised, developed and celebrated”, he added. “And those who have done well contribute back to society, and help others do better.” 9.22pm: Not just material needs, human spirit must flourish, says PM Lee Singaporeans are encouraged to follow their passions, break new ground and do the country proud, said Mr Lee, sharing the stories of several people who have done so. Mark Ong: Artist who loved drawing as a child. He designs customised sneakers for celebrities and shoe companies after winning an online competition in 2003. Darius Cheung and Roshni Mahtani: Husband and wife who founded property platform 99.co and theAsianparent.com, respectively. Wong Kah Chun: At 32 years old, he is the chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra in Germany. Next year he will be a guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for the Chinese New Year concert. He also co-founded an initiative to bring music to less privileged and special needs children in Singapore. 9.21pm: Schemes will stretch over 50 years and more Mr Lee said the plans to improve healthcare and housing are “fundamental commitments by my Government to you”. 9.13pm: JUST IN – New scheme called VERS (Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme) to be introduced in 20 years This is primarily for older estates like Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok. The Government will compensate residents whose flats are taken back early and help them get another flat to live in. The scheme is voluntary and residents will have to vote “yes” for it to proceed. The idea behind VERS is to avoid a situation where 99-year leases in older estates all expire at around the same time, leaving authorities with a situation where homes will have to be found for a lot of people at once. \n\n\n\n\n  9.09pm: SERS is one option but it is “a very limited scheme” Touching on the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), Mr Lee said HDB estimates that only 5 per cent of flats are suitable. The scheme is meant for selected HDB blocks which have high development value which can be unlocked, he explained. 9.06pm: JUST IN – HIP II to be introduced (Second round of upgrading) HDB flats get HIP about 30 years after they were built. HIP II will be the second round of upgrading for these flats when they are about 60 to 70 years old. “In short, every HDB flat can expect to be upgraded twice during their lease,” said Mr Lee. This will cost the Government “probably even more” than S$4 billion, which is what will be spent in the first HIP which was launched 10 years ago. \n\n\n\n\n 9.05pm: JUST IN – Home Improvement Programme (HIP) to be expanded HIP will be expanded to include HDB blocks built up to 1997. The programme currently covers flats built up to 1986. With the expansion, another 230,000 flats will benefit – in estates such as Pasir Ris, Tampines and Jurong. \n\n\n\n\n  8.59pm: Why are HDB leases 99 years? This is the only way to ensure that all our descendants can buy new BTO flats of their own, said Mr Lee. Homeowners may pass their flats down to future generations, but those not lucky enough to inherit a property will get nothing, he explained. “Our society would split into property owners and those who cannot afford a property. That would be most unequal and socially divisive.”  8.57pm: Will I outlive my flat’s 99-year lease? Very few of today’s HDB owners will outlive their leases, said Mr Lee. It will happen to less than 2 per cent of households, including those who bought resale flats, he added. But it could happen to homeowners’ children if they decide to pass the flat down to them. “But this should not be a problem if your children buy their own BTO flat, with its own 99-year lease, as many do,” said Mr Lee. 8.56pm: 99-year leases – MND working on expanding lease buyback scheme Mr Lee said the lease buyback scheme may be expanded to help HDB homeowners monetise older flats. The scheme allows elderly homeowners to sell the tail end of the flat’s lease back to HDB in exchange for a cash bonus. The National Development Ministry is also working on improving the liquidity of the resale market, said Mr Lee. 8.47pm: JUST IN – Government will work out a Merdeka Generation Package Remember the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) launched four years ago? That was for Singaporeans born in 1949 and earlier. Those born in the 1950s - who just missed out on the PGP benefits – have not been forgotten, said Mr Lee. The Merdeka Generation Package will help those born in the 1950s to meet their medical expenses. \n\n\n\n\n 8.43pm: The Merdeka Generation Mr Lee spoke of what he termed the \"Merdeka Generation\", those born in the 1950s who experienced the changes as Singapore merged with Malaysia, separated, then gain unexpected independence. 8.38pm: CareShield Life – financial support for long-term care Confused about what CareShield Life is all about? You’re not alone. It is the most difficult of the healthcare schemes to explain to the public, according to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. Mr Lee said CareShield Life is important because as many as one in two Singaporeans will at some point no longer be able to perform three Activities of Daily Living. 8.35pm: More polyclinics to be built There will be polyclinics in Sembawang, Eunos, Kallang and Bukit Panjang by 2020; and in Nee Soon Central and Tampines North by 2023. \n\n\n\n\n 8.30pm: JUST IN – CHAS will be extended to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, regardless of income The benefits will continue to be tiered according to income, Mr Lee announced. CHAS, or Community Health Assist Scheme, previously covered middle to lower-income Singaporeans by giving them subsidies at participating clinics. \n\n\n\n\n 8.30pm: Attention to housing, education and healthcare “We will spare no effort to ensure you can afford them,” said Mr Lee. 8.27pm: KL-Singapore High-Speed Rail project Both the KL-Singapore High-Speed Rail and Rapid Transit System have legally binding bilateral agreements, Mr Lee reiterated. “Both sides have to carry out what has been agreed to, unless we mutually agree to vary the terms,” he added. On the water issue, Mr Lee said: “The Water Agreement is sacrosanct. We must proceed strictly in accordance with the terms.” 8.25pm: Bilateral ties with Malaysia When Mr Lee visited Putrajaya shortly after the watershed election, he told Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad that he wanted to work with him to take the bilateral relationship forward. “He agreed that we should, because we are each other’s closest neighbours,” said Mr Lee. 8.20pm: US-China trade war Continuing on the theme of external developments, Mr Lee reiterated that tit-for-tat trade wars affect business confidence and threaten global prosperity. “There are no winners in a trade war,” he said. “Small and open economies are especially vulnerable. Singapore will suffer collateral damage.” 8.17pm: Trump-Kim summit Mr Lee began his English speech by talking about the Trump-Kim summit which Singapore hosted. “It was a daunting task, but we rose to the challenge,” he said, thanking the officers who worked hard to organise and secure the event. Mr Lee said an officer from the Gurkha Contingent told him that during the event, a woman had leaned over a crowd barrier to say: “Thank you for keeping Singapore safe!” 7.30pm: Hawker culture as part of UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage? Possibly! Singapore will nominate hawker culture to be inscribed in UNESCO’s list. This will help to safeguard and promote the “unique culture” for future generations, said Mr Lee. “It will also let the rest of the world know about our local food and unique multicultural heritage.” 7.25pm: More hawker centres being built Seven hawker centres have been built in the last few years and there are 13 more to come, with stalls required to provide affordable food options. This is to help Singaporeans manage the cost of eating out, said Mr Lee. He revealed that dishes from nine hawker stalls will be catered at this year's rally reception. 7.20pm: Ways to bring down the bills Avoid using 4G to watch movies when you are out of the house, and tap on Wireless@SG where it is available, Mr Lee suggested, using mobile phone bills as an example of how to manage costs.  Another example is the cost of infant formula. Mr Lee said there are now more reasonably priced infant milk formula to choose from so parents can make choices based on their needs and budget. 7.16pm: Why can’t the Government fix the electricity tariff? Because Singapore imports almost all its energy, the Government cannot control electricity tariffs, said Mr Lee. And if the Government introduces fixed tariffs, it would mean costly subsidies which are not sustainable, he added. Also, that would mean people who use more electricity would receive more subsidies. 7.10pm: Quiz – have current electricity prices gone up or down compared to 10 years ago? Answer: Today’s tariff is lower – at 23.65 cents/kwh – compared to 25.07 cents/kwh in the third quarter of 2008. (Although the tariff has gone up and down over the years) The Government has tried to keep inflation low but cannot completely prevent prices of items such as water and electricity from going up, said Mr Lee. 7.06pm: Four reasons why Singaporeans feel cost of living pressures - First, young couples grapple with the cost of buying their first home and starting a family; - The “sandwiched generation” worry about looking after both their parents and children; - Quality of life has improved and people aspire to have more - Inflation 7.02pm: Singapore had “a good year overall” Mr Lee started his Mandarin speech with a positive picture of the economy, which he said is growing steadily. 7pm: The 3Ms – MUIS, Mendaki and MESRA Mr Lee highlighted the importance of these three institutions in strengthening the Malay-Muslim community. Going forward, they will pool their resources and work more closely together to tackle challenges such as getting more children to attend pre-school, mentoring youth and dealing with social problems. “Singapore must remain a country where all Malays can achieve their aspirations,” said Mr Lee. 6.32pm: Geylang Serai to be turned into a culturally distinct precinct Speaking in Malay, Mr Lee said more can be done to make Geylang Serai a culturally distinct precinct. Senior Minister of State Maliki Osman has been appointed to lead this project, and will work with local businesses, government agencies and MESRA to make the area more vibrant and special. He highlighted Wisma Geylang Serai as an icon in the precinct. The social and cultural heritage space - housing a community club and other facilities - was recently completed. 6.46pm: Good luck to Team Singapore athletes Mr Lee kicked off his speech by wishing Singapore athletes taking part in the Asian Games in Indonesia all the best. \"We are cheering for them. Go for gold!\" 6.40pm: Key issues in last year's National Day Rally In his 2017 speech, Mr Lee spoke about upgrading pre-schools, fighting diabetes and building a Smart Nation. 6.24pm: Mr Lee's team posts a photo of him arriving ahead of the National Day Rally  6.15pm: National Day Rally 2018 to begin at 6.45pm PM Lee will begin his address to the nation at 6.45pm, speaking first in Malay and then in Mandarin. He will deliver his English speech at 8.15pm, at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College Central campus in Ang Mo Kio. The rally will also be livestreamed on Mediacorp's Toggle and channelnewsasia.com, PMO's YouTube channel, PM Lee's Facebook page and the REACH Facebook page.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-day-rally-2018-pm-lee-hsien-loong-10630850"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 02:10PM", "tags": ["gender equality", "women"], "author": "Nabilah Husna", "title": "Commentary: Gender equality is not just a 'women’s issue'", "content": " SINGAPORE: According to a survey of 809 teenage boys that AWARE published last year, nine in 10 teenage boys reported facing pressures to be “manly” through experiences of harassment, bullying, teasing, social exclusion, and psychological and physical violence.  The most common forms of such pressure are being told to “man-up” and to “take it like a man”.  Many of us accept that this pressure which boys and men so regularly face is one way gender inequality manifests. Yet when we actually talk about gender equality, many mention visions of greater female representation on boards and in government, or something basic, like women’s rights to education and work.  In thinkpieces and social discourse, gender equality is often framed as a responsibility that is largely in the hands of women and girls - that women ought to be more “outspoken” or “assertive” to get that promotion at work or muscle their way up the career ladder.  It too easily becomes a conversation about women’s “shortcomings”, and how women should behave, participate and contribute to right this deeply-entrenched imbalance.   Where are the men in this picture? It's clear that men also have a stake in gender equality.  Indeed men may have a greater responsibility to work towards it, as a group with collectively more power, influence and capital than women. But striving for equality won’t just improve society’s treatment of women and girls: Men, too, benefit. CHALLENGE GENDER ROLES EARLY A society that prioritises gender equality would start teaching boys and girls about the harms of gender roles early.  In Singapore, this can be done through implementing mandatory gender equality and comprehensive sexuality education in the school curriculum, which encourages young men and women to strive for more healthy and equal relationships. If Singapore had such a curriculum in place, we probably would hear fewer stories about the gender stereotyping and sexist beliefs that young people are often subject to or reinforce – some examples in recent years include officially-distributed pamphlets telling young people about “female doublespeak”, and university orientation games that make light of sexual violence and gender-based violence. These unhealthy messages would have less room to grow if young people are taught values of gender equality, respect and diversity, the same way they are taught racial and religious harmony in school. MEN ARE ALSO AFFECTED  Boys and men are directly affected by narrow ideas about gender. Through the survey cited above, we found that 54 per cent of respondents have hit, punched, shoved or spat on another boy, while 74 per cent have experienced some form of physical violence.  “If (the bullied) said how they felt when someone insulted them, (the bullies) would say to “take it like a man” and “stop being such a girl”, one respondent said. Some reported how boys seen to be “weak” or “girly” were even sexually abused.  The harms of pressures to conform seem fairly obvious. Everyone should be free to behave in ways that feel comfortable without the threat of violence. By reforming traditional ideas about gender, we can start to move away from real or implied threats of violence, and leave more than just overt gender-based violence behind. After all, gender inequality doesn't only lead to violence - it restricts individual expression, contributes to economic inequality, and limits men and women's role in their households and communities, among others. CAREGIVING SHOULD NOT BE ONLY A WOMAN’S RESPONSIBILITY Let’s take the issue of caregiving in the family - a big part of many people’s lives in Singapore, especially with our ageing population. Myths about how women are more naturally nurturing and caring than men seem to shape our national policies.  For instance, mothers receive 16 weeks of maternity leave, while fathers receive only two weeks of paternity leave. Fathers are allowed to share maternity leave, though only up to four weeks.  Might this be the reason for why women assume a heavier caregiving burden?  According to Ministry of Social and Family Development’s survey of informal family caregivers of older adults, 60 per cent of caregivers were women. The message is unfortunately loud and clear – childcare and eldercare remain primarily “women’s issues”. We see this translate into women’s inability to fully participate in the labour force, which result in their financial stability and livelihoods suffering.  78 per cent of prime-age working women who were out of the labour force two years ago in a survey by the Ministry of Manpower cited “family responsibilities” as their main reason for not working, compared to 9.6 per cent of men.  This ripples into old age: Women have 11 per cent less CPF savings in old age than men do, an analysis by the Central Provident Fund found last year.  A STRONGER, AND MORE EQUAL, SINGAPORE What would Singapore look like if men were equal contributors to care and household labour? We would see greater economic growth, with women returning to the labour force after being freed up from unpaid care responsibilities that otherwise would fall entirely on them.  Dual-income households generally fare better in an expensive city like Singapore, so the pressure for men to be sole income earners is likely to lessen. In parallel, we would hopefully see national institutions improve at a greater pace to support this progress. We already see a thirst for flexibility and more family-friendly policies in workplaces. There is a slow but growing normalisation of flexi-work arrangements among more progressive companies.  Employers are recognising their staff as more than just workers, but as individuals with care, domestic and personal responsibilities and needs as well. Employment policies that support family life and promote gender equality would enable all workers, including men, to better juggle work and care.  It's no wonder, then, that there are higher rates of retention and greater job satisfaction when employees feel like their contributions are supported and valued, beyond their office doors. So it’s not just women who would benefit from initiatives like paid caregiving leave or equalised parental leave. Many fathers are starting to be more active parents, and healthy workplace allowances are encouraging egalitarian family structures, rather than one that is determined by gender.  After all, the underlying assumption that men are simply not interested in playing a bigger role in their children’s lives, or caring for their own family members, is unfair to men. DON’T TAKE TOO LONG It sounds like an all-around win, for men and women to strive towards gender equality. So what’s taking us so long to get there?  For gender equality to truly be achieved, much has to change. Individual attitudes and beliefs about gender need to be reformed, of course, but this would do little unless there are also accommodations made in our workplaces, educational institutions and communities.  Our laws and policies need to also address gender-based barriers – for instance, by increasing paid paternity leave to encourage equal caregiving. Gender equality is not a pipe dream. But for it to be a reality, men need to recognise how gender inequality creates unfair, narrow and even toxic versions of themselves and their roles in society; and they need to see it equally as their responsibility, too.  And then they, as allies working alongside women, need to act.

For millions of commuters worldwide, Uber has changed the face of transport, allowing people to find rides with an ease previously unheard of. From a start-up in 2009, it has grown into one of the world’s most valuable private technology companies, valued at some US$62 billion (S$85 billion) today. The behemoth made its foray into Southeast Asia with a launch in Singapore in 2013, followed by tiny start-up Grab later that year. Five years later, however, the San Francisco-based firm conceded defeat and said goodbye to the region – its assets, offices and drivers now under the control of its rival. The story of how a Singapore-based champion outgunned this ride-hailing giant is told in the new season of Inside the Storm – a series about how major companies are run, the high-pressure decisions and risks they take, and how they adapt in times of crisis. A DISRUPTIVE, IRREVERENT COMPANY Uber started out in San Francisco as UberCab, a limousine service that could be ordered via text or a tap of a button on one’s phone. It was an immediate hit. Back then, there were numerous complaints about how expensive taxis were in the United States and how difficult it was to get them, said Assistant Professor Yang Nan of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School’s strategy and policy department. Uber was a great alternative, as its location-based app made hiring an on-demand driver easy. “It was so successful because the industry there was ripe for disruption,” said Dr Yang. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The then CEO, Mr Travis Kalanick, set the culture for the company, with “this idea of a disruptive, irreverent company that wanted to break all the rules”, said former BBC correspondent Mark Worthington, now the managing director (Singapore) of Klareco Communications. It was probably that energy and originality that led to Uber's very early and very rapid success. Between 2011 and 2014, Uber’s value jumped from US$60 million to US$17 billion as it expanded into 100 cities across North America, Europe, India, China, and Southeast Asia. In 2012, Mr Vidit Agrawal became Uber’s first employee in Asia, at a time when few had heard of the brand in this region. “When I told my parents I was going to join Uber, they were like, ‘Are you going to become a taxi operator?’” said Mr Agrawal, who started out as an operations manager in the company. Uber’s expansion strategy of “go in, think later” involved scaling up rapidly and getting as many users and subscribers as it could. The company did not, however, actively seek out and work with regulators, pointed out Nanyang Business School Adjunct Associate Professor Zafar Momin. “That worked pretty well in the US”, but when Uber got to some markets in Europe and Asia, it “encountered a few difficulties”, he said. “One is that the regulatory framework wasn't as kind or welcoming.” NOT LOCAL ENOUGH In addition, Uber lost its monopoly as copycat apps cropped up and competition heated up in all of its markets, such as Lyft and Gett in the US and Didi Chuxing in China. In Southeast Asia, Grab had grand ambitions: To provide safe and convenient taxi services in Malaysia and the rest of the region. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Its co-founder Tan Hooi Ling recalled how, growing up in Malaysia, she constantly tried to convince her parents to let her take a taxi, as they were concerned she could be robbed or raped. “Because of certain bad apples in the system, the entire industry got a tremendously bad reputation. So we were trying to solve this from a holistic perspective,” she said. The company carved out a niche for itself, focusing on local needs and cultures. A local understanding of the market is something that cannot be underestimated, said Mr Lim Kell Jay, the head of Grab Singapore. “Every city is different, even within the same country,” he said. “So you need to understand all those nuances to serve your customers better.” For example, recognising that many Southeast Asian cities had monstrous traffic jams, the firm unveiled GrabBike – motorcycle taxis that can weave in and out of traffic – in Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand in 2014 and 2015. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While Uber cars were stuck in traffic, Grab cruised ahead in the market with their bikes. Uber eventually caught on – 17 months too late. That “hyper-local approach” was important, which a global company “sometimes takes for granted”, said Ms Tan. WATCH: How Grab won the David-and-Goliath battle against Uber (Dur 3:27)  While Uber was designed for the global market, it did try to localise, said Mr Agrawal. But competitors like Grab and Go-Jek “had people (and) engineering teams on the ground, and their decision-making could've been a lot faster than ours”. In under three years, Grab had expanded into 21 Southeast Asian cities. And by 2016, it had become a major competitor to Uber. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The latter also failed to understand that cash was king in Southeast Asia, accepting only credit cards for two years in some parts of the region before introducing cash payments, and it cost the firm dear. Mr Lim noted: “We started out with cash, and that helped us tremendously in competing with the other players.” DISTRACTED BY SCANDALS Despite its efforts, Uber was falling behind in foreign markets. And it was being dogged by scandals – taxi companies have protested its presence in their cities, and it was banned in Delhi after one of its drivers raped a woman. Last year, when US President Donald Trump enforced the refugee ban, taxi companies joined American protesters at New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport in a show of solidarity, by refusing to pick up passengers. But Uber continued operating and profited from the strike, a politically-laden decision that sparked the #DeleteUber campaign. Barely a month later, the company was found using a software called Greyball, which barred certain individuals, including law enforcement officers, from using its service. Around the same time, a video of Mr Kalanick berating an Uber driver went viral; and former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post accusing the firm of fostering a misogynistic corporate culture. An investigation report made 47 recommendations as to how to change its culture, and 20 employees were fired owing to a separate harassment probe. Associate Professor Chu Junhong, from the NUS Business School’s department of marketing, said: “(There were) lots of PR crises. It really damaged the company's public image.” The issues of political alignment, profiteering, sexual harassment and the conduct of the CEO himself made last year a terrible one for Uber, noted Mr Worthington. “When you're hit by all of these in a short period of a few months, unless you do something very drastic, there's always going to be a danger that what people are questioning isn’t the individual incident but the company as a whole.” Grab, on the other hand, had an advantage over Uber when it came to staying out of trouble. It was “seen as friendlier – as, in some ways, more in tune with the needs of their customers”, he added. With Uber spending resources putting out fires in the US, it left its other markets vulnerable. Mr Agrawal admitted: “It did affect the focus, and it also gave an opportunity to our competitors – Ola in India, to Grab. They weren’t leading the market, but they could easily focus on these markets. They doubled down on their initiatives and led a lot of the markets. PRICE WAR In China, Uber’s grand plans to defeat homegrown company Didi Chuxing ended with its exit in 2016 and billions lost. “Didi could concentrate all its resources in the Chinese market to compete with Uber, but Uber couldn’t concentrate all its resources in the Chinese market because Uber had so many markets to take care of,” said Dr Chu. Its departure from China galvanised its Southeast Asian competitors. Said Mr Lim: “We started thinking, ‘Hey, a homegrown local company is able to overcome a global giant.’ And that's when the belief started.” Last year, Uber and Grab launched a price war. The end goal was presumably for one to force the other out of the market. Dr Momin said: “It’s like having a fuse burning at both ends. And that's a way to burn up cash very quickly, which is what happened for both companies.” In March this year, Uber decided to exit Southeast Asia, with its competitor acquiring its operations and assets in eight countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. Said Ms Tan: “It was a big milestone for us because it was a reinforcement (of our belief) that we were doing the right things and that the crazy journey we had started was worth it.” Dr Momin does not see it as a failure on Uber’s part, however, but rather as the company trimming its portfolio to focus on a few countries, instead of “trying to fight a battle on so many fronts”. “So in some ways it's a smart move on the part of Uber,” he said. “It's even good because it gets a stake in Grab, which now has a high valuation.” While Grab is now a household name in Southeast Asia, its long-term profitability is questionable, as with that of Uber and Didi. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “If you take other disruptive companies like Amazon, they’d also lost money for a long time, but eventually they did start turning positive profits,” Dr Momin added. “But Uber hasn’t turned positive profits; neither has Grab, and I don’t think Didi has either.” For now, Grab can enjoy being the victor of a David and Goliath battle, whose outcome few would have predicted five years ago. “We don’t take that good fortune lightly,” said Ms Tan. “We take it as a very significant responsibility because we’ve been fortunate to be able to do what we get to do now.” Grab “did a very good job” of catching up with Uber, acknowledged Dr Yang. “How it successfully operated here … catered for the local demand, understood the local market and designed products to fit the local demands – you have to give it credit.” The new season of Inside the Storm tells the stories of the high-pressure decisions and risks taken by some of the world's biggest brands: Uber, Apple, Haier, Japan Airlines and Starbucks. Watch the series here.

Many have offered their views on what it means to have a home in Singapore and how we can help lower-income families put a better roof over their heads. It is heartening to see that there is no lack of passionate champions for the vulnerable. As a former employee of the Housing and Development Board, I have been following these discussions keenly. I am intrigued by one suggestion that we should build bigger public rental flats, and create a larger subsidised public rental housing programme catering to a higher share of the population.  It is not difficult to build more and bigger rental flats. The more fundamental issue is this - what is the best way of allocating the limited quantum of housing subsidies within the Government’s budget?  RENT OR OWN? Some countries prefer to allocate the subsidies in favour of rental. For example, in Hong Kong, about 29 per cent of the population live in subsidised public rental housing, with more renting from the open market.  There is little prospect of young couples owning a decently sized home when they are ready for marriage, something we have almost taken for granted in Singapore.   We have opted for a different approach to housing here, right from the early days of nation building. It is one that emphasises homeownership as a key pillar of our social compact. Today, more than 90 per cent of residents in Singapore own their homes, with about 80 per cent of Singaporeans living in HDB flats. Even among the less well-off in our society – 83 per cent of the bottom 10 per cent of households in terms of income own a home, and this figure stands at 87 per cent for the bottom 20 per cent of households. The success of our public housing story is well documented and remains a model many nations aspire to. If we had weighed our subsidies towards rental, the housing outcomes for Singapore would have been quite different.  MORE HELP TO OWN A FLAT In fact, HDB used to offer 3-room rental flats. This was discontinued in 1982. At that time, many existing tenants preferred to buy their own three-room flats, as it made more financial sense for them to do so, given the highly subsidised pricing for such new flats. They could also use their CPF savings to pay for it, instead of paying rent in cash, and they got to own the flat at the end of the day. Since then, the Government has continued to enhance subsidies for home ownership.  Housing subsidies are more generous and also designed to be progressive and fair. Grants such as the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) are means tested, with lower-income families receiving larger grants. Effectively, low-income families buying new HDB flats can receive up to S$80,000 in grants, on top of the already subsidised flat price. Eligible families buying HDB resale flats can also receive up to S$120,000 in grants. There are also specific schemes to help rental tenants achieve homeownership, including giving them priority in the ballot for new flats, and additional grants under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. MANY STILL ASPIRE TO OWN THEIR OWN HOME My sense is that most rental households today continue to aspire to have their own homes. In the last five years, about 3,700 households living in subsidised rental flats have moved on to homeownership.  Last year we saw a record high of almost 1,000 of such households moving on to own their homes. This upward trend is a positive development.  I expect many of them are first-timer households, who would qualify for significant housing grants, are typically younger and can take a larger loan due to the longer tenure.  But even among the second-timer households who live in public rental flats, the desire for homeownership is strong, looking at the positive response towards the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. WE NEED AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO HELP VULNERABLE FAMILIES However, each family has their own journey, and we cannot rush them into buying a home if they are not ready. Some may need more time to work on stabilising their finances and family circumstances before buying a flat, and we should respect that and support them to become ready. The discussion so far has shown that housing the vulnerable is complex because it is not just about bricks and mortar – the cement of homes is the stability of family relationships. When these break down, while housing support is important, social support is also crucial. We have seen differing philosophies and approaches among social work practitioners on how to provide such support.  I would like to suggest a few areas to focus on.  First, we should consider how to better integrate the various modes of social assistance, and intensify the handholding and support we provide to families in rental flats. Such an operating model has shown some positive results in Project 4650, where tenants of two Interim Rental Housing blocks in Bedok South were offered intensive assistance in their homeownership journey. Families in public rental often face multiple challenges - financial difficulties, unemployment, family conflict and so on. Currently, they have to approach different agencies for help with each challenge, and each agency may not have a complete picture of the family. Guiding rental tenants towards owning their homes thus requires extensive coordination between the Government and voluntary groups to better understand the challenges tenants face.  The various parties have to jointly build a comprehensive view of each family’s situation. They should also agree on a shared approach to help the family so that the various forms of assistance provided complement one another and holistically tackle their challenges.  In this regard, I welcome the recent announcement by the Ministry of Social and Family Development to set up social service hubs in and around rental housing precincts. Mindset changes are also needed to ensure the success of these social service hubs.  Instead of operating in silos, frontline staff supporting our rental families must be empowered to take an integrated approach, putting families, not organisations, at the centre of their work.  IMPROVE PUBLIC RENTAL FLATS Second, there is scope to improve the physical environment in public rental blocks. The newer HDB rental blocks, with better ventilation, natural lighting along the corridor and larger, elder-friendly toilets, do have better designs and are much more liveable compared to older rental blocks. I have seen examples of both. So we should expedite the replacement and renewal of older rental blocks with new and better designed ones. Third, we can do more to integrate rental and sold units within the same block or precinct. HDB has started building mixed blocks which contain both rental and homeownership flats. But it is disappointing to see negative reactions to this announcement. Some people were concerned that the rental flats would devalue the neighbouring homeownership flats; others made disparaging remarks about the habits of rental tenants. HELP MUST COME FROM ALL OF US This brings me to my final suggestion, which is that helping others is not only the job of Government agencies. It is up to all of us to provide mutual support and care for fellow Singaporeans. We can step forward with our skills. Retired teachers have volunteered to tutor children at the Homework Cafe in Project 4650. We can also offer our time and energy. The Cassia Resettlement Team helped elderly rental tenants move from their old flats to their new ones in Cassia Crescent, and continue to befriend them and help them with their daily needs. These examples show that ordinary citizens can come together to make extraordinary difference in helping others. I have great respect for the social work practitioners, public service officers, and volunteers who already give their effort and understanding to others in need. More of us can and should do the same.

In an era where many major bookstores have closed down, his independent bookstore BooksActually has survived and is going strong after 13 years. When I arrive there, he is behind a stack of books next to the cashier. He wears a nondescript T-shirt and glasses. The only thing that is easily visible from afar is his spiky black hair. It’s a weekday and only a handful of people are browsing the rows of books that stretch from floor to ceiling at BooksActually at Yong Siak Street in Tiong Bahru. We move into a backroom to talk. The 40-year-old answers questions with aplomb, but it feels as if I’m speaking with someone who is more a booklover than a businessman. However, to survive in this business, you “necessarily have to be both”, he concedes.  To listen to the full interview, click here. The business turned a modest profit of S$80,000 last year. For a single bookstore, “that’s actually quite ok”, he says. To a great extent, the figure is modest because he has been pumping more money into boosting the bookstore’s publishing arm, Math Paper Press, through which he often publishes local work that may not always make money, but that he considers important to “put out there”. “When someone sends you a manuscript, whether it’s fiction, non-fiction, or a children’s book, they are trying to tell a story. Especially if it is a Singaporean who has submitted the manuscript to you, they’re trying to tell you a particular narrative of their own. And that narrative is as important as us winning an Olympic gold medal. Because that’s part of who we are, that’s part of our history.”  Investing in publishing has slowed down his progress towards buying a permanent retail property for the bookstore.  While he and his co-founder have been making the business work entirely on their own dime so far, they recently started a fundraising effort to rope in investors to help them do this.  “It’s more sustainable than paying rent and we hope we can do this through this crowdfunding effort.” Over the last 13 years, they have moved three times, each time due to an increase in rent but for the last seven years, they’ve managed to establish some stability in Tiong Bahru. The current rent is about S$10,000 a month but he’s not complaining. “If you’re a good business owner, regardless of what the rent is, low or high, (if) you know that the location works for you and the numbers are proving right, you’ll just stay. So for now, it’s fine. But in the future, we don’t know what’s going to happen and who wants to be a sucker to any landlord who’s going to increase your rent by 50 to a 100 per cent?” While he bemoans high rents, he doesn’t believe, as some businessmen do, that the authorities should intervene to control them. “That’s just how the free market economy works. If you expect the landlords to reduce rent or if you ask the Government to intervene to reduce retail rents, you’re just being lazy and asking to be spoon-fed. We have to remember that it's not free money. Rental subsidies will have to come from taxpayers.  \"Business people should just accept this is the way it is, crunch your numbers well and do more to make your business successful. That's what we have been trying to do. But if the price is too high, then you have to move. That's just how the economy is. But we also want to explore other options such as having our own property.” I remark that his public fundraising effort for this could be construed as \"asking to be spoon-fed\".  He disagrees.  “We are aware that nobody owes us a living. It's your private money. If you decide to help or invest, then do it. If you decide not to help, it's fine too,” he says decisively. We talk more about the numbers and his strategy to convince people to help later but to understand Mr Leck’s motivations it’s necessary to take a step back. WOULD HE AMOUNT TO NOTHING? He came from a low-income family. His father was a taxi-driver and his mother a housewife. They both recognised the importance of reading. “My mum was a typical parent who read a lot of self-help books about parenting. While she encouraged me to spend a lot of time in the library, she was also never stingy when it came to buying books for me.” He attributes his desire to own books instead of simply borrowing them from the library, to a “covetous” instinct that he believes many book lovers possess. “My mother would never say no. She would crunch her own numbers and figure out how she can transfer money from her household expenses to buy me books. I remember in school when there was an opportunity to buy several sets of encyclopedias, she bought them for me on a three-year instalment plan.” He dropped out of an accountancy and taxation diploma course in a local polytechnic just two semesters before graduation and went to work at Borders before co-founding BooksActually in 2005. He picked the polytechnic course for a very specific reason. “My dad fell very ill when I was 17 so the family needed me to come up with a solid income after National Service (NS). I chose all the business-related courses, and I ended up with Accounting and Taxation. It was a very clear route. If you’re there, after NS you can just go on to do your accounting papers, and eventually you can become a chartered accountant which pays really well.” But things changed. His father became better and landed a well-paying job at a church. This helped seal his decision to turn his back on school to pursue his dreams. His polytechnic course manager at the time actually told him he would amount to nothing. His memories of this are still very vivid. “I remember this person, but I understand why she said it. It was the context of that time. I think many people didn’t believe that you could succeed without paper qualifications. I was actually doing well in school. I was probably one of the top 10 students and I enjoyed studying things like taxation. But I also knew it’s not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.” His parents seemed to understand his decision. “I told my dad I wanted to quit, and broke down the number of years that would be saved if I were to quit immediately, and he told me to go ahead. That’s what my parents have given to me. Since I was a kid, they’ve always trusted me to make my own mistakes, and to own them to make decisions, whether good or bad.” BOOKSTORES HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO BLAME Working at major bookstores such as Borders and Tower Books taught him what not to do. He has said in previous interviews that the mistake many of these stores made was to sell non-book merchandise such as stationery, movie posters, gadgets and even snacks. He admits now that he was guilty of this too, albeit to a much more limited extent today. \"Booksellers are guilty. All of us are guilty. There were phases of this bookstore when we brought in non-book products because they brought in the money. As we went on, we realised that we are a bookstore, so why are we selling all these things? If we’re a bookstore, let’s work harder at selling books.\" His focus is on displaying and marketing the books well and to that end, he sets up pop-up stores around the island. He believes that consumers should not be blamed for losing interest in reading or in physical books. “The bookstores that haven’t made it have only themselves to blame. I’m in the business so I know. Sometimes, they receive stock and they don’t display it.  They’ll leave it somewhere in a box. Three months later, they’ll tell you that the books don’t sell. So who is to blame? Is it the consumer, or is it the bookstore manager that managed the outlet? Or is it the top not managing the business well enough to ensure that when the books come in, they get processed and displayed?  \"And not just displayed in terms of shoving it in, but making a nice visual display, and doing enough marketing and branding.” FEAR AND ANXIETY He set up his first bookstore in Telok Ayer Street with less than S$25,000. “We borrowed $20,000 from my co-founder’s mom. We had maybe S$1,000 in our bank accounts. I borrowed S$700 from my dad. I remember because my dad had to take the loan from a fellow church member, and I had to pay it back within the month, so the number was very clear-cut. “We picked up quite a bit of contractor skills. We actually made our display tables from discarded wood mounted on Ikea shelving units. We did quite a fair bit of painting ourselves. A lot of our marketing materials were made in-house. The do-it-yourself philosophy became more pronounced as the years went by. The current wooden wine crates that you see in the bookstore today were all mounted and put together by us. We sourced the wine crates, planned the layout, and then fitted it into the walls.” When they first started out, there would be days when there would be no sales whatsoever. He remembers the fear and anxiety he felt then. “I think for any retailer, bookstore or otherwise, that’s the scariest thing that could ever happen. I remember that happening a few times in that first year. One day I fell ill, so I decided to take a break. The second day, I was actually feeling okay, but I was feeling so demoralised that I decided to stay at home another day. Then another. On the fourth morning, I woke up and I decided I shouldn’t do that, no matter if there are sales or not. I should just suck it up, open it up because you never know what’s going to happen.” He calls that period a turning point. “If I was serious about running the business and if there’s zero sales, it means that I’ve to do something about it whether it is organising an event, doing more marketing, doing more branding, get people in and get the sales.” He was to face even more challenges later though. He sold a 3-room HDB flat that his mother left him when she died and with the S$200,000 he made from it, he set up a second bookstore at Club Street which failed. “I miscalculated. The space there was huge and we had to buy stocks from scratch. We had to buy a lot to fill up that huge space that we had. And the money burned faster than you could ever think.” They had to close it eventually, but thankfully have managed to continue sustaining at least one store till today. WHY INVEST IN A BOOKSTORE? I ask how his fundraising efforts to purchase a commercial retail property for the bookstore are going. The BooksActually Shophouse Fund has only made S$20,000 to date. They'll need much more for a downpayment.  “An ideal location in Jalan Besar where it’s got a good vibe and slightly, but not totally gentrified, in total, will set us back about S$5 million. For a not-so-ideal location, but a location that we still like, it’ll be about S$2 million.” He is considering the Balestier area. I ask him what his proposition to donors is. Why should people contribute to this fund? “I guess it’s about possibilities. Over time, we have connected with a lot of people, formed relationships and we have discovered simple things. For example, just two months ago, a customer who used to visit us at our previous location came back from the UK after completing her studies and she told us that she’s so happy to see us still around, because now she can show her kid what the bookstore meant to her when she was still studying in Singapore.” I remark that it all sounds merely sentimental. What’s the business rationale? “There’s no business rationale. There’s only that very intangible part of it. Everybody’s always asking where are our roots? Where is our commonality in this country, right? If they like to ask that but they tell you that actually we have no roots in this country because everything is changing so fast and places are disappearing, they are obviously not looking hard enough or not investing in it.  \"Maybe someone down the road that you might be married to, or your kid might end up being a writer, might end up being a musician, might end up being an artist who we end up supporting. When you invest in us, it comes back around to you.” But it seems as if he hasn’t managed to convince many people with that argument. He ascribes the dismal contributions to a lack of publicity for the fundraising efforts and intends to ramp them up progressively. STANDING FOR SOMETHING But he reveals that “quite a handful” of private investors have actually offered to contribute, but once they realised what he stood for, they retreated. “Bookstores tend to have a certain amount of character, and the character here is derived heavily from me – the person running it. For example, I am against discrimination and injustice, so a few years ago when the National Library Board pulled some books from their shelves because they highlighted different types of families including same-sex parents, we took a stand. We went to Amazon and bought all the 300-odd copies of And Tango Makes Three left in stock and sold them at our bookstore. “We stand up against anything that discriminates against another person but some of our potential investors with deep pockets are of a certain social standing, and they are not comfortable aligning themselves with such causes.” He clearly would rather reject the money than relinquish his ideals. For now, he concedes that his modest profits will not get them far in terms of acquiring property, but he is determined to soldier on. His ultimate goal is to have one large bookstore modeled after The Strand Bookstore in New York City. In other respects, he is happy to continue living humbly. “I currently only draw an allowance that covers food and transport, and I rent an apartment near the bookstore which doubles up as our publishing office, and storage area for our book stocks, plus bookstore supplies.  \"I don’t take any holidays. For the first nine years of the bookstore's existence, I did not travel because that was an unnecessary expense. When I had the chance to go to Bangkok after being invited to be a speaker in 2015 for the Bangkok Literary Festival they paid for all my expenses.” Considering that at this time, he can't afford to expand or buy his own retail property, clearly the bookselling business, on the scale he does it, has its limitations.  I ask if wealth is even a goal of his. “I want to achieve wealth but I want to achieve wealth that enables me or the bookstore to help those who need it most because I’ve experienced what it’s like to grow up in a low-income family. I’ve seen how my folks struggled to make ends meet and not deprive their two kids of basic material comforts. “The lowest point was when my father fell ill, nearly died, and with the loss of the sole-breadwinner in the family, we were suddenly at a loss. I was 17 that year doing my 'O' levels. We were either very, very lucky or blessed or both. His major hospital bills were close to 80 per cent subsidised by the government based on our income level, and for the rest, our church stepped in. That kind of support meant that my mother could ease her way into a job.” Experiencing this “lack of wealth” has put him on a path to be as self-sufficient as possible but it has also ingrained in him a deep belief that any wealth gained must be used to help another person in need. In his business, he classifies budding writers as “those in need”. Through the publishing arm, Math Paper Press, he goes out of his way to help them in spite of the fact that some of the work lacks quality. “There’s definitely a quality deficit. Over the years, it has of course improved by leaps and bounds, especially in the last decade. But we’re always going to have a quality deficit because there’s not enough being pushed out. How are you going to reach higher standards when you only have three or four serious publishers, compared to a city like London where they have many more. They also have a longer history than us. “But we already have some really good work too that gets ignored because sometimes local publishers don’t push it hard enough. We have to do a better job.” In the meantime, he sees it as his responsibility to give all writers a “good debut”. He contributes to society in other ways by sponsoring books for community reading programmes for children from low-income families. Recently, he also contributed several thousand dollars to helping pay rent for a shelter for transgender individuals. STAYING RELEVANT As we turn to talking business again, he concedes that in some quarters it’s believed that physical books will become passé no matter how well they are marketed. “I think the covetous side of book lovers - the fact that we are tactile beings - will ensure there'll be a market for books. But I also know that there are questions about how environmentally-friendly all this is.” I point out that e-books have a carbon footprint too, but ask him to justify why he continues his business in spite of his concerns. He thinks the trade-offs are worth it. “With books, we push knowledge and insight. All of us have been impacted by one or a handful of books. I think that’s where the value is. You are consuming resources, but we are producing books for pushing conversations, for keeping narratives, for pushing the envelope. Using paper to produce a book is much more valuable than using the same resources to produce a memo-pad.” Some suggest that in a country with very good public libraries, buying books may in fact be wasteful too. But he insists that book lovers’ covetous instincts that he alluded to earlier can make bookselling a viable business long into the future. In fact, he welcomes competition.   “If we want to become a nation of readers, you need to have more bookstores. People today would rather open a cupcake shop than a bookshop, but they don’t know how to crunch numbers. They’ll always tell you that there’s a great number of people who will eat cupcakes, but soon many of these businesses will fold. I believe if they crunch the numbers right and did the right marketing and publicity, they’ll see bookselling can be viable.” Competition, he believes, will also keep him and his team from becoming complacent. His advice to budding business owners is simple. “Don’t go in with the mindset of trying it for just two to three years and falling back on something else you’re more familiar with. If you go in with that mindset, you’re setting yourself up for an easy failure.  If you’re faced with a life-and-death situation, you will think of more ways to stay alive, right? In business it’s the same thing, if you are presented with one problem, there can be multiple solutions. But if you go in with that mindset, you won’t even be able to see these solutions. You'll just give up.” While running a sustainable business is clearly important to him, when asked what impact he’d like to ultimately make in the industry, his answer has very little to do with monetary concerns. “I always say the best way to die is to be just sitting in a chair reading a book, and to suddenly just expire. But throughout my life, I remember the individuals who’ve left a huge mark on me, whether teachers, parents or friends. I think that’s the most valuable thing. In your toughest times, you look back and know that those individuals have propped you up, put you on their shoulders so you can walk better. Hopefully, I can be that support for others in my personal and business life.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/kenny-leck-bookstore-owner-booksactually-on-the-record-10625364"}, {"datetime": "19 Aug 2018 06:26AM", "tags": ["football", "S-League", "Singapore Premier League"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'I can never say no to football': The Singaporean who played on 5 different continents", "content": " SINGAPORE: South Africa, Australia, USA, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Thailand, Mongolia, Iceland, New Zealand, Italy, Cameroon, Portugal and the Netherlands. The list of countries which 34-year-old David Low has visited reads like a traveller's dream. His usual itinerary, however, is a straightforward one: Eat, sleep, football, repeat. Here is a footballer who never played professionally in Singapore, but since 2007 has turned out in foreign leagues that no Singaporean had ventured to. The midfielder's career had taken him to five continents: Africa, Australia, North America, Europe and Asia. He has had to brave racist remarks and Malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, all because he had one goal in mind: To test himself as a footballer at the highest level possible. \"Football is my passion, I just fell in love with the game,\" said Low. \"I wanted to challenge myself to be the best I could.\" OUT OF AFRICA Low's love for the game blossomed on South Africa's streets, rather than Singapore's street soccer courts. His father decided to relocate the family to the city of Newcastle to pursue business opportunities there when Low was 10. \"I didn't have a proper coach,\" Low recalled. \"I played in school; I played street football all the time.\" Much to his parents' annoyance, too. Low would tell them he was attending extra lessons in school, when he was actually out playing football. His parents would eventually find out what he had been up to. \"When I didn't do well in school or my grades were poor, they would ban me from playing,\" Low said. \"But that only made me more determined to make it.\" Life in South Africa for the family was different, too. The crime rate there was high - his parents had their car windows smashed twice and Low remembers hearing gunshots on the streets - and so the family eventually returned to Singapore.  In 2002 Low enlisted for National Service in the Army. After he completed his stint he trained with Tampines Rovers' Prime League team, but nothing came out of it. \"I thought I had a good chance to break into the team,\" he said. \"But I was told that the National Football Academy (NFA) and the Under-18 boys were given preference as they came through the system and were mostly 18- to 20-year-olds while I was already 22.\" Undeterred, Low decided to look abroad. In January 2007 he left for Australia, where he signed a contract with semi-professional side South West Phoenix FC. \"It wasn't very far from Singapore, the flight didn't cost much and I have a family friend there,\" he explained. \"(At that point) I was (already) prepared to be kicked out of the house for football - I had to do what I had to do.\" But an ankle injury meant that Low had to fly back to Singapore for treatment later that month. \"I was not used to playing with big, physical players,\" he said. \"Their fitness was on another level ... the way they trained, the facilities, they were very professional.\" He returned to Australia in June and remained there until the end of the year. He was not offered a new contract, so he left for the US in 2008.  But later that year, Low got an opportunity to attend a training camp with German fifth division side Freiburger FC.  It's one of Germany's oldest clubs, but Low was unhappy with the way Freiburger's coaches treated him.  \"They looked down on Asian players, especially if you're not from Japan, Korea, China or the Middle East,\" he said.  Instead Low signed with Offenburger FV, another fifth division team, where he played for eight months. HOME NOT SO SWEET HOME Stints in Switzerland, Hungary and Thailand followed before Low returned home to try out once again in the S.League (now Singapore Premier League). But he did not make the cut at one club and his wage demands proved a stumbling block at another. \"I just felt I deserved to be in but the coaches had their own opinions,\" said Low. \"It didn't really bother me anyway.\" His next stop: Mongolia, where he played for Khoromkhon FC in the country's top division in 2012. \"Some of the Mongolians had no clue Singapore even existed,\" Low recalled. \"I had to tell them 'Malaysia? Do you know Malaysia? It's somewhere around there'.\" Due to extreme weather in Mongolia, clubs would play outdoors in the summer and indoors - in a 5-a-side futsal league - during the winter, Low said. And things were going well on the pitch. Low was part of the side that won the Mongolian Cup and the team finished runners-up in the league. Yet he was already aiming for bigger and better things. \"I had already pre-planned that I was not going to stay put,\" Low said. \"While the season was ongoing, I was already talking to agents and coaches from other countries.\" He went on to play in Iceland, France, New Zealand, Italy and again in the US.  \"After Italy and US, I told myself, 'That's it for me',\" said the globetrotting Low. \"My parents were telling me that I'd better settle down and get married. I said okay, I will try to please my parents for once.\" That was until he received a call from former Cameroon international Emmanuel Maboang Kessack, who knew the Singaporean from his short stint with a recreational side of African players in Paris. Kessack asked if Low was keen on a trial with a Cameroonian side in the top division.  \"Without hesitation, I packed my bags and left,\" Low said. THE 'CHINESE MAN OF COSMOS' Landing in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde in 2015, he saw a city unlike any he had seen from his travels.  \"There were no malls, no high-rise buildings,\" he said. \"A lot of the terrain was rocky and mountainous. Everything was different.\" The locals found him strange, too. \"I was the only white guy there,\" he explained. \"The last time an Asian played there was in 2007. I was an alien.\" Fans would swarm Low for photographs after training sessions. He also recalled attending a trial match where the opponents wanted pictures with him as well. \"They would come in hordes,\" said Low, who signed for Canon Yaounde after a two-week trial. \"The fan clubs there had power. If you didn't play well in training sessions, they would tell the coaches not to play you in games.\" Low joined his second club in Cameroon the following year, linking up with Cosmos de Bafia. \"I was loving it in Cameroon,\" explained Low, who was given the nickname Cosmos Chinois (Chinese in French) or Cosmos Le Blanc (the White) by fans. \"I was being tested at a high level of football and that was what kept me going. I had a place to stay and my basic necessities were met, so I was happy.\" \"The mosquitoes were the most difficult thing about living in Cameroon,\" he added. \"We had to burn a lot of mosquito coils and use a mosquito net. There could be 10 in a room if you didn't close your door at night!\" He returned to Singapore in mid-2016, preparing to wind down his career.  A TOUGH TRANSITION The following year, Low found a job as a security systems administrator in a bank. For a man who has travelled all over the globe, being bound to a desk was the hardest part.  \"I was a bit depressed because I was not playing competitive football,\" he admitted. \"I felt that I was not in my element, I could not express myself and living a fake life doing a nine-to-five office job. But I have no complaints because I know this is the way it is in Singapore.\" Earlier this year, Low turned down an offer from Cameroon champions Coton Sport due to concerns over accommodation and safety - the club are based in the country's North, not far from the Nigerian border where militants Boko Haram rule. But just days after his interview with Channel NewsAsia, he jetted off to the Netherlands - signing as a non-contract player for Dutch side NEC Nijmegen.   He will be based there till Christmas, playing with the top-tier side's third team and assisting with youth coaching. This time around, Low has got his parents' blessing. \"The funny part is that before I went to Holland, they told me to go and enjoy myself, go and do what I love. They saw that I was struggling when I was working the nine-to-five job,\" he said. Low is adamant that youngsters who aspire to be full-time footballers should be in the game for the right reasons. For him it was never about the money, he insisted. \"Whatever the clubs could give me, and whatever is a decent wage for a single man like me, I would take it,\" said Low, who earned a monthly wage of between US$1,500 and US$2,500 in Mongolia and Cameroon. He does not foresee himself playing at the professional level for much longer. \"Maybe after Holland, I might stop playing,\" he said. \"But for me to go into coaching is also a no-brainer ... I can never say no to football, it's part of me now.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-pro-contract-singaporean-played-football-five-continents-10621466"}, {"datetime": "18 Aug 2018 11:16PM", "tags": ["SMRT"], "author": "", "title": "Track fault causes late-night delay on East-West Line", "content": " SINGAPORE: A track fault on the East-West Line caused delays of more than an hour between Tampines MRT station and Pasir Ris MRT station on Saturday (Aug 18) night.

He (Dressel) didn't do as well this year - that's not bashing on him, that's just the nature of the sport. \"It's a brutal sport and sometimes you've got to just keeping fighting through and see what you come out with.\" Schooling shot to fame at the last Asian Games in Incheon four years ago when he captured gold in the 100m fly, silver in the 50m fly and a bronze in the 200m fly. Despite his wake-up call in Hungary last year, Schooling backed himself to bounce back in Jakarta. \"The Asian Games is always huge,\" he said. \"It's up there with the world championships and a bit under the Olympics. \"I've had some good training under my belt,\" added Schooling, who has dropped the 200m fly for the 50m freestyle and also goes in the 50m fly and a couple of relays. \"Whenever you can sub a 200 for a 50 it's awesome.

So, I will still be swimming, hopefully another Asian Games in four years. So, that's where I see myself.\"  Schooling, who skipped the Commonwealth Games earlier this year, will have a heavy schedule at the Asian Games when swimming competitions begin in Jakarta on Sunday.  He will be competing in the 100m butterfly, 50m butterfly, 50m freestyle, 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m individual medley. The 23-year-old has shed 4kg and is likely to be in better shape to defend his 100m butterfly title than he was when he was beaten by India's Virahawal Khade at the Singapore championships earlier this year. When asked about his choice to compete in the 50m butterfly event instead of the 200m race, Schooling said the swap helped him “sleep a lot easier”. \"Whenever you can swap a 200 for a 50, it's awesome. I sleep a lot easier. I am excited for that. I wanted to do the do the 100 freestyle, but it kind of clashes with 50 butterfly or something like that,\" he said. “So I am trying the 50 freestyle. I am working a lot on speed. I don't know. I am very excited to swim three less laps in a single race,” he added.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) and North East Community Development Council (CDC) announced this initiative on Saturday (Aug 18), at the launch of the “Switch and Save – Use LED” @ North East programme. Households can reap \"both energy and cost savings\" by replacing incandescent or compact fluorescent lights with LED lights, said NEA and North East CDC in a joint release. More than 13,000 households in the North East District will benefit from this programme, they added. According to the Household Energy Consumption Study conducted by NEA in 2017, only 28 per cent of households in one- and two-room public housing flats use LED lights - the lowest adoption rate among household size types. Lights are one of the top five electricity-consuming applicances in a home, according to the study. “If all these households switch to LED lights, they are expected to collectively save about 360,000 kWh annually – equivalent to more than S$70,000 in energy savings – and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 150 tonnes per annum,” said NEA and North East CDC. Due to a growing population, Singapore’s total household electricity consumption has gone up by about 17 per cent in the last decade, said the two bodies. \"As electricity is largely produced by the burning of fossil fuels, lowering our electricity consumption can help reduce the environmental impact of resource mining and emissions produced to generate electricity,” the statement added. All eligible households in the North East District will be notified via mail to collect their vouchers from designated collection points, such as their nearest community centre. The S$25 voucher can be used at all Home-Fix, Selffix and Sheng Siong stores across Singapore, Philips Light Lab, as well as roadshows organised by NEA and North East CDC. More details can be found at NEA’s Clean & Green Singapore website.  \"Taking care of the environment can be done though simple ways,\" said NEA Chief Executive Officer Ronnie Tay. \"By choosing energy-saving appliances, households can not only save energy and reduce their utility bills, but also reduce carbon emissions.\" “Switching to LED lights is a simple first step all can take.

The RAD Race will be held in tandem with the Ultra Great Britain.  \"I have been blessed to be able to run for good causes with much support and encouragement since 2005, I hope to be able to contribute more and also to motivate people to take up exercise as part of their lifestyle,\" added Mr Lim.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ultramarathoner-lim-nghee-huat-345km-ultra-great-britain-10626570"}, {"datetime": "18 Aug 2018 06:29AM", "tags": ["teenage", "suicide"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "‘I thought of my mother’: Moving on from the teenage suicide pact that shook Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: Looking back to his life 10 years ago, Andy (not his real name) didn't think he would be where he is now. The 26-year-old recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with an engineering degree, and he is about a month into his first job. Every weekday, he leaves his home in Tampines at 5.30 in the morning to catch one of the first few trains to his office in Boon Lay. He only gets back at 8.30 in the evening. But he doesn't mind as it's a decent job, he says, which allows him to work on driverless vehicles and protect their systems from being hacked. This, however, is a big turnaround from the events of Aug 23, 2008, when Andy was a taxi ride away from what he firmly believes would have been the end of his life. “If I had sat inside that taxi, I wouldn’t be here talking to you,” he told Channel NewsAsia over lunch at a McDonald’s near his workplace. “Witaya said ‘faster come in, we need to go back and do this'.” Andy was referring to Ku Witaya, the teenage student who jumped from a ninth-floor window and died in a suicide pact involving seven other friends. A coroner’s inquiry held a year later revealed that Witaya, 16, had convinced the group that another world war was coming, and their job was to destroy demons and save the world. But to do so, they first had to die and be resurrected as “slayers”. In the wee hours of that August day, Witaya and his friend Sia Chan Hong, also 16, leapt first. The rest were supposed to follow in two batches of three, but backed out after seeing their friends below. Andy is adamant that had he followed them in the cab to Witaya's home at Bedok Reservoir, he would have been in the first three to jump. Earlier, the group had been celebrating one of their birthdays at a barbecue at East Coast Park. “I said no, I want to go back,” he said, adding that Witaya tried convincing him up till they got in the taxi. “Because I thought of my mother.” SHINING IN SCHOOL The incident happened as Andy, a struggling Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) student in Tampines Secondary School, was about to take his N-Levels. He had only been narrowly promoted after failing all but two of his subjects in Secondary 3. Andy was still grieving as he took a Chinese composition paper, so he found himself writing about his friends and repeating the same phrase over and over: “It’s very painful to lose them.\" “My teacher singled me out and talked to me,” he said. “She said you really need to move on.” That was a turning point in his journey towards a brighter future. Andy’s teachers became his pillar of support. His form teacher Ms Tan Shin Shin, someone he described as very patient and his biggest inspiration, advised him to work hard for his N- and O-Levels. “You will see the fruit of your labour,” he remembered her saying. “Your parents will get old one day and you will need to support the family.” Andy gave everything he had in those final few months. He said he’d never studied harder during all his years in the school. It paid off: Andy aced the N-Levels, and continued getting good grades through to his O-Levels. “Slowly, I shifted focus,” he said. “Instead of focusing on their deaths, I focused on my studies.” His report card, filled with ‘F’s in Secondary 3, gleamed with ‘A’s a year later. His class position, he recalled with a smile, went from 38/40 to 1/40. Andy also topped his Normal (Academic) cohort for his prelims, then came in second for his O’s. “From there I saw the success of the work I put in,” he added. “I saw that if I put in this amount of hardship in my studies, I can achieve this. It was quite a good recognition.” The hard work never stopped while Andy was studying Biomedical Engineering in Temasek Polytechnic, and this eventually earned him a spot in NTU. Back at McDonald’s, Andy whipped out his phone and proudly showed off his post-convocation photo, which he also sent to Ms Tan in a WhatsApp message thanking her for her support. Ms Tan is still teaching at his old school. In the picture, Andy is beaming in his graduation gown and standing beside his parents. His mother, donning his mortarboard, is holding his certificate and some flowers. “My mother cried over the incident,” he said. “It was lucky that I didn’t follow them. If I did, I wouldn’t have been able to take this photo with them. That’s why I’m very grateful.” BROTHERS FOR LIFE During their days in Tampines Secondary School, many in the group followed and looked up to Witaya, whom Andy described as a natural leader who was fearless and charismatic. Most of the nine friends met as Secondary 1 classmates, and like many of their peers they bonded over basketball and video games. They also gathered regularly at Witaya’s home. “He really took care of us,” Andy said, referring to Witaya. “He really did it for you.” When one of them ran into trouble with bad company, Witaya was the first to stand up to them. When another one ran up huge gambling debts, Witaya was the first to sell his Sony Ericsson phone to help pay it off. While the group stayed tight-knit throughout the years, school threatened to divide it. At the end of Secondary 3, some of the members, including Witaya, were retained because they did poorly in their exams. Andy got labelled the smart one because he was promoted. “We are still brothers,” he had insisted. Andy admitted to drifting slightly apart, but still got invited to that fateful barbecue. It was an ideal occasion to get together like the good old days. “I hugged Sia Chan Hong, I hugged him for very long,” Andy said, recalling what happened at the barbecue. \"He was very sad; he just said goodbye to me.” The incident dominated the headlines a decade ago. Reporters appeared at the group's homes and spoke to their relatives.  And while many years have passed, the incident is still mentioned by some. For instance, it appears on The Smart Local website in a list of incidents that \"shook\" Singapore. It is also used as a law case study at a Taiwanese university, Andy said. LEAVING THE PAST BEHIND But for the group, Andy said they have moved on and the scars have healed.  The boys still meet once or twice a week, and more frequently during holidays like Christmas and Chinese New Year, though some have drifted a little because of work and family. Still, Andy is in a WhatsApp group with three of them, who are now an interior designer, wedding photographer and undergraduate also doing engineering at NTU. Two others are helping with a family construction business and the last member is a fitness trainer. “I pulled him with me and mentored him,” Andy said, referring to the undergraduate who’s also the youngest in the group. “I told him he must really study and shift his focus to the right track.” “Most of them are okay now, able to survive and find their own livelihood,” he added. They don't talk about the incident either. Instead, topics involve applying for Build-To-Order flats or their current jobs, which means complaining about difficult design projects or getting lowballed for a wedding shoot. “It’s been too long already,” Andy said. “Everybody was like okay, life goes on.” For Andy, what remains of the past are his regular Friday visits to Witaya's home. When he's not too busy with work, he goes there with a few of the group to care for Witaya’s elderly grandmother and help with the housework. FAMILY AND REGRETS Nevertheless, details from a decade ago, like their statements to the police and testimony to the coroner, are still easily recalled. “It really hurt you a lot, so you remember,” Andy said. But when asked if he regrets not doing more to stop the incident, he paused to think. “If you took my mindset now and looked back, I would have gone and punched Witaya and asked him to stop all this,” he said. “But last time, we were still young and not mature in our thinking.” That is not the case now, as Andy offered some advice for teens who might be tempted by friends to do something they would later regret. “Think of your family first,” he added. “Friends come and go, but family is the one that never leaves you.” Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

Don’t hinder them from returning to work", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mother, Member of Parliament, and partner at a legal firm. Rahayu Mahzam’s juggling of work and motherhood has been an uplifting tale for readers this week. Her return to her MP duties one month after giving birth to her son Ayden has earned her the moniker of “super mum” among inspired readers. She credits the help she gets from loved ones. But the unfortunate reality for many new mothers is that re-entry into the workforce is neither easy nor seamless, especially for those without extended family support. WHY SO HARD TO RETURN TO WORK? Some say mums opt out because they find work less appealing after experiencing the joys of full-time motherhood. But many mothers say it’s because their bosses see them in a different light – as being less committed and more saddled with family distractions. Such attitudes lead them to feel less valued by their organisations. There may not be wrongful dismissal or overt discrimination against pregnancy or motherhood that provide grounds for action to be taken against employers. But small things can add up, like when mothers say they cannot can’t stand the looks from supervisors when they have to take urgent leave because of unforeseen child emergencies, an experience some dads say they share. These frustrating but familiar dilemmas can be easily resolved if mums negotiate for themselves, some say. Do new mothers know what they need to balance career duties and the new demands of motherhood? Are they upfront with their bosses about their expectations? Yet we cannot ignore the reality that mothers bear most of the caregiving burden for young children and feel powerless to insist that their company accommodates them at every stage of their kids’ development. Societal norms may be part of the issue. Through the school years, just think about who schools are more inclined to call first when a child falls sick or gets into trouble – mum or dad? NOT WORKING HARMS WOMEN TOO Mothers who drop out, even for a little bit, suffer adverse effects in terms of income and career progression. This is worrying when national trends show the workforce participation rate in Singapore for women dips after age 25. Much as the situation has improved, the Government recognises this challenge and the impact it has on women. Manpower Minister Josephine Teo highlighted in Parliament in March that fewer women achieve retirement adequacy in terms of being able to meet their CPF Basic Retirement Sum compared to men, when more stop working because of reasons like childcare. The best way to tackle these issues is to enable women to remain in the workforce and continue to advance in their careers, she concluded. STRONGER CHILDCARE SUPPORT IS CRITICAL Strengthening childcare support can give working mothers the peace of mind her kids are in good hands and a better chance of holding down a job. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s announcement to increase pre-school places by 40,000 over the next five years at last year’s National Day Rally is a step in this direction to broaden access to affordable and quality childcare, and has received strong public support. Many agree childcare is one area that deserves more attention for some groups of mothers. Enhancing childcare options by licensing child minders and providing night childcare services, were a few of the recommendations made by local advocacy group AWARE this week, to help new mothers from lower-income households who may have to work shifts get back to work. READJUSTING TO WORK NOT EASY While childcare is critical, it is not sufficient in helping mums adjust to work after some time away. Mothers themselves recognise this and are doing something about it. Since last year, a new programme by local group Mums@Work helps match companies to PMET mothers who took a career break. It also helps mothers get used to a working environment again. But are companies buying it? Only half of surveyed companies in Singapore say they’ve hired a woman who wants to rejoin the workforce, according to a 2017 study by recruitment agency Robert Walters. Perhaps the best approach is to ensure mums don’t leave in the first place, like what Mrs Teo said. COMPANIES MUST BE MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY Companies have the power to make their workplaces more family friendly and aid mothers in this regard. After all, they have a vested interest in retaining this talent pool, since mothers who drop out are likely to be as qualified and competent as their male counterparts. The key may be not to single out mothers by giving them some sort of special dispensation but improve work-life integration as a whole. Some know this and give all staff time off or allow them to start later. Local precision engineering firm Feinmetall does this, despite being a small company with 50 or so employees. Surely larger enterprises can adopt more aggressive flexible work arrangements, including telecommuting and giving their staff the option of working part-time. You might not expect those in a fast-paced sector like banking to afford these kinds of practices, but OCBC has seen at least one vice-president take the plunge into part-time work for more than a year to spend time with her children, according to news reports. This would certainly require firms to have sufficient backup coverage, so that co-workers having to pick up the tempo to compensate doesn’t become the norm and lead to resentment. I also wonder whether organisations will be brave enough to abandon the time clock altogether and switch to a results-only system, where performance is measured against whether timelines are met and objectives achieved. This may be near-impossible for those in operational roles. But for others, it’s worth noting that research shows organisations with strong work-life practices enjoy higher productivity, stronger employee engagement and satisfaction, and higher rates of retention. WE NEED A DIFFERENT CULTURE Perhaps mindsets are at the core of this issue. Do we over-value presentism and face time? Do colleagues cast judgment if someone needs to take off because of a child emergency, regardless of whether the child is a toddler or a teenager? Do bosses trust employees to fulfill their responsibilities? And do they have their employees’ welfare at heart, or do they expect them to shed their personal identities, emotions and responsibilities when they get to work? Instead of a fixation about what is lost when companies give employees more flexibility, can we focus on what is gained? The most equal and happy societies have companies with admittedly ambitious pro-family practices, but it’s worth looking at them to think out of the box. Swedish company IKEA’s move to offer fathers, including those working in Singapore, month-long paternity leave is one refreshing example of how family-friendly organisations help mums - by giving dads the space to do more at home and be equal partners in the endeavour of raising kids. MORE THAN A VILLAGE TO HELP MUMS RETURN TO WORK It takes a village to raise a child, but it will take more to help a mother get back to work. There is a happy ending to Mdm Rahayu’s tale of returning to work. Things are less hectic now as Ayden’s schedule has settled into some sort of regularity, she says. As deputy chairperson for the Government Parliament Committee for Social and Family Development, I have no doubt Mdm Rahayu will do her best to facilitate more of such positive stories of working mothers returning to pick up where they left off. Meanwhile, there is much to be done to help other “super mums” get there, and we should all be part of this tale.

That is a question that might spring to mind following the dip in retail sales figures at department stores in June. Although the Great Singapore Sale (GSS) was underway at the time, retail sales fell 7.3 per cent compared to the month before. Year-on-year, retail sales for department stores were 1.9 percent lower. Food retailers, supermarkets, sellers of furniture, household equipment, optical goods and books did not fare well either. However, executive director at the Singapore Retailers Association, Rose Tong, was not disappointed by those results. She explained why in this week's Asia Business First podcast. \"In the month of June, COE prices for cars were the lowest. There were windfalls from en-bloc sales. All this, I imagine, led to shoppers thinking, ‘I have more money right now. I can go on more extended holidays.’ There were also more property launches, so that’s where all the money went. “GSS is actually a household name today and definitely one that is known worldwide. If you search for ‘GSS’ online, it will pop up all over and it is recognized as one of the top five shopping festivals. I do not think people have fallen out of love with GSS. But expectations have been raised that GSS has to be better. “Shoppers have been conditioned to seeing sales all year round, so right now [the GSS] is not quite the sale worth waiting for.” Michael Chiam, senior lecturer in Tourism at Ngee Polytechnic, agreed. “In the past, you only have sales at certain points in the year – four times a year. But today you have sales almost every day. If you want to make the GSS something extraordinary, it has to be out of the norm. You must have sense of excitement to engage customers.” To bring back the buzz, Ms Tong said the Singapore Retailers Association has been exploring the idea of shortening the GSS period, which is currently 10 weeks long. “I think 10 weeks long could be a bit limiting and exhausting. And if we have it too long, it could reduce the urgency to shop.” Another possibility is renaming the Great Singapore Sale. “We would still keep the acronym 'GSS' because it is great for branding. But we might not call it a 'sale'. Calling it a 'sale' limits the ability to do other things and there are some retailers who do not want to be specifically associated with a sale. So we thought it could be a Great Singapore Shopping Festival.” Mr Chiam also said that the notion of a sale could have negative connotations. “I think a carnival or festival may be a better thing than a sale, because a sale can be associated with cheap things.” With the preponderance of chain stores in local shopping malls, the Singapore Retailers Association is well aware of the need to promote products that are “uniquely Singapore” in nature, so as to attract both local and foreign shoppers alike. Ms Tong gave a hint of what to expect in next year’s GSS. “We want to promote Singapore, and this is where the Singapore brands could be largely promoted. And if you don’t call it a ‘sale’, the Singapore brands will feel that they will not be associated with the sale. I think it is time to take the Singapore brands to the fore and see them as being able to help Singapore differentiate itself.” To hear the suggestions for revitalizing Singapore’s retail scene, listen to the full podcast here.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/right-now-it-s-not-quite-the-sale-worth-waiting-for-how-to-10626406"}, {"datetime": "18 Aug 2018 06:20AM", "tags": ["crime", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Derrick A Paulo,", "title": "Inside the women’s prison: Empathy, rigour and help to turn inmates' lives around", "content": " SINGAPORE: The prison officer waited outside the room as the inmate spoke to her family. These opportunities, which come twice a month for prisoners, can be joyful or upsetting – this time, it was the latter. When she came out, she was hysterical. “Her brother had passed away in his sleep the night before,” said Rehabilitation Officer 2 (RO 2) Nurul Hazirah Abdul Halim, 25, who knew that the two siblings were very close. What added to the inmate's grief was that her family didn't ask for her to be allowed to attend the funeral. And RO 2 Nurul Hazirah, her personal supervisor, was there to console her. Being a source of comfort might seem a job for counsellors, rather than prison officers. But the latter are now spending more time engaging inmates meaningfully, as CNA Insider found out after gaining an unprecedented level of access to Singapore’s only women’s prison. Institution A4, formerly known as Changi Women’s Prison, houses approximately 1,200 inmates, one tenth of the prisoner population. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n And at the heart of it all – from the programmes and workshops for inmates, to the counselling and family visits – are the all-women team of approximately 90 officers running the prison. They are not only warders but also a listening ear, both for inmates unburdening their angst about personal problems as well as for more mundane requests that range from changing cells to changing the food boxes. The role of the guard has been evolving more towards inmate rehabilitation, and for the officers it means adding more tools to their repertoire – beyond the batons and pepper foam that are a part of their standard carry – like empathy. Said Assistant Superintendent of Prisons 1 Evelyn Tan, 25: “While we empathise, it’s not because we pity them, I think. It’s more because we want to understand what they’ve been through so that we can help them to be better.\" And the inmates typically have been through a lot to end up in jail, the officers note. WHY THEY ARE THERE Relationships, alcohol and traumatic experiences like sexual abuse were some of the starting points for many female inmates. RO 2 Nurul Hazirah said: Sometimes when you speak to the inmates, and you find out they’re here because their husband forced them to take drugs and all that, as a woman you get very angry. Among young inmates, especially those from broken families, it often started with peer pressure and the need for attention and love. “When they found a group of friends who were willing to like, ‘let’s do this and stuff’, then they felt accepted,” said Sergeant 3 Alysa Naqeera Mohd Isa, 23, a business diploma holder who joined the prison service to learn why people commit crimes and to teach them alternatives. Many inmates also told the officers that a lack of control was their downfall. Deputy Superintendent of Prisons 1 (DSP 1) Ottilia Hoo, 35, said: “So in a moment of folly, they took drugs, they went with their friends to do some shoplifting, things like that.” Sometimes the drug-taking happened because of body image issues. Whatever the reason, some 75 per cent of the women inmates are drug offenders – not that their officers view them through the prism of their crime. “They can be murderers or drug addicts, it doesn’t matter,” said RO 2 Nurul Hazirah. “Our job is to just render help when needed.” WATCH: An unprecedented look at life behind bars (8:39)  And to help, these officers must take a professional approach. DSP 1 Hoo, an 11-year veteran, said: “I think it’s very easy to judge when you read the papers and you read about crimes that in your opinion are horrific. “But at the same time, it’s knowing that when we put on the uniform every day, we have a duty to discharge, and it has to be done impartially, regardless of how we’re feeling.” She has also seen enough to know there are misconceptions about prison and its occupants. “People think we’re dealing with hardened criminals because of what they see in popular fiction,” she said. But at the end of the day, you realise that an inmate is still a person. This person could have been your neighbour or someone you sat next to on the bus. The officers themselves come from varied backgrounds – from those with a degree in history and Southeast Asian studies, to those who had worked in other Home Team agencies and wanted to do more than catch the bad guys. And just as the inmates do not easily fit the stereotypes of them, the officers too are not quite what some expect. For example, when DSP 1 Hoo was just a job applicant who “thought the chance to interact with people and hear their stories sounded like a meaningful career”, someone questioned her suitability for the role of prison officer. “He looked at me and said I reminded him of an office lady,” said the diminutive woman. “I think it’s the way I look.” WHAT INMATES GO THROUGH While the officers believe that prison is about second chances, the inmates must adjust to the rigours of incarceration before they can be rehabilitated. In the first stage of their jail term, known as the deterrence phase – which varies in duration depending on each inmate’s sentence and needs – they are confined to their cells for 23 hours a day. This means minimal rehab programmes. They are allowed one book at a time, and no visits are permitted, except from lawyers, embassy officials or counsellors. The experience allows them to “reflect on their past actions”, according to the Singapore Prison Service (SPS). Their cells are spartan. Spotted in one were four transparent boxes of the occupants’ belongings, lined neatly against a wall. An arm’s length away, white flannels hung from four of the five hooks on the wall. All inmates are issued a standard set of toiletries, a wrist tag they must wear wherever they go, and for their bed, they have a straw mat. A low wall separates the sleeping area from the toilet. There are no mirrors to be found, only a polished stainless steel plate hung in a sports hall, their Recreation Yard. It is the only way inmates can catch their reflection, and queues are common in the one hour of free time they are allowed outside their cells each day. It gets better for inmates when they move on to the “treatment phase” of their sentence. They can have up to six books – three from their family and three from the library – in their cell. Unlimited letters from their family are allowed, while they get to send two letters a month. Importantly, they can receive two visits a month, either a combination of a 20-minute face-to-face meeting and a 30-minute teleconference, or two 30-minute teleconferences. In the day room, the area right outside their cells, there is a television and newspapers in Singapore’s four official languages. With no internet access, these together with the family visits are the inmates’ touchpoints for the outside world, although certain articles like crime reports are screened out of the papers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CNA Insider’s visit was a rare sight for the inmates. But it also necessitated DSP 1 Hoo’s reassurance to them that neither their faces nor their identity would be revealed. FOCUSING ON REHABILITATIVE WORK As the Officer in Charge of the institution’s Housing Unit 1, she is responsible for its overall management. Yet, despite the weight of the daily operations, she went about with a smile, even bantering with the inmates about prison food. The use of technology has freed up officers like her for their higher-order work of rehabilitative engagement. In the Recreation Yard stood an example of the automation of routines. At a blue kiosk, two inmates were peering at the screen to check the status of their requests, such as for dental treatment and religious reading material. Called the Inmate Self-Service Kiosk, it allows inmates to make administrative requests, obtain inmate-related information and even redeem privileges like the purchase of snacks, stamps and greeting cards. But it is not just technology that is transforming the nature of the officers’ work. In recent months, pilot workshops have been run for them so that they can work more closely with the correctional rehabilitation specialists. This helps the officers to relate to the inmates better. “The rehabilitative effort is a concerted effort of everybody,” said DSP 1 Hoo. But dealing with the issues from day to day is largely (done) by officers. We engage more, we see them more. She leads a team of Housing Unit officers and personal supervisors, and the latter oversee the welfare of inmates and their daily activities. There are about 20 inmates under each personal supervisor, and through their interactions in their respective Housing Units, the officers come to know the profiles of their inmates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Now that the officers are being taught by the correctional rehabilitation specialists, however, they are better able to reinforce the psychological skills training the inmates receive and to encourage them. Ms Charlotte Stephen, SPS senior assistant director of Correctional Rehabilitation Services (Women), explained: “So when (an inmate) gets angry, the officer would remind her, ‘Do you know what you’ve learnt? Instead of shouting, practise your deep breathing, capture your thoughts … and then do it in a way that’s more acceptable.’” Correctional rehabilitation specialists like her do group interventions, each comprising about 10 inmates in the treatment phase. The psychological-based programme typically runs for six to nine months, with two-hour sessions held thrice a week. Such rehabilitation remains a work in progress, as part of efforts to reduce the female reoffender rate of nearly 25 per cent within two years of release. Inside the prison, however, Ms Stephen can see the gains being made with the inmates, who were responsive and relaxed during one such session that CNA Insider observed. As one of them shared, “I’m quite a quick-tempered person. But as time went by during my incarceration here, I managed to mellow down and change a lot of my thoughts and behaviours, to overcome problems I’ll face in future.” LOOKING FOR HAPPINESS BEHIND BARS Apart from the programmes that aim to address stress, drug addiction, anger management and violence, there are family programmes tailored to meet the inmates’ needs as mothers and daughters. There is also vocational training. The institution includes an art room and a bakery as well as a hair salon opening this year. The certified courses already available include hairdressing, baking and Microsoft Office, besides the academic ones. Only during such times, when the inmates have rehabilitation activities, do they get to have their meals in the dining hall instead of their cells, if that is more convenient. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There is also a work programme – a tailoring workshop for inmates to mend linens for hospitals – which they can qualify for if they meet the eligibility requirements. These include good conduct and personal interest. They can save the allowance they receive and use the balance to buy items from the self-service machines in prison. They are also encouraged to send the money to their families. “Doing actual work, instead of just programmes that equip them with basic skills, gives them an opportunity to have a sense of contributing back to society,” said DSP 1 Hoo. The pursuit of happiness behind bars is no easy feat. That is why even the little things count for the inmates – like Ms Stephen’s choice of the “beanbag room” for one group session, which prompted a delighted inmate to go “Whee!” Or take, for example, the pre-recorded TV programmes they are allowed to watch. They get “quite a wide variety” of shows, including films, but they have their favourites. “In general, inmates do prefer watching variety shows such as America’s Got Talent. Things that have a feel-good factor help them to feel happier,” said DSP 1 Hoo. That explained the bright colours of their Housing Unit and the murals of motivational messages around them. “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending,” read one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For one inmate CNA Insider spoke with, satisfaction comes from her role as a Housing Unit attendant who DSP 1 Hoo said “helps inmates to go from point to point”, like when they have programmes in rooms on another floor. The foreigner, who has been incarcerated for about two years now, used to speak very poor English, but the officers encouraged her to learn the language slowly. The other inmates did not listen to her initially, but now they do. When DSP 1 Hoo asked how she felt about that change, she replied: “Very happy lah. Sometimes I’m scared the officers (would) scold us, but now okay.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WHAT THEY GET OUT OF THE JOB When people think of prison, fear might be a word that comes to mind – that inmates are afraid of the guards, acknowledged Sergeant 2 (SGT 2) Nazurah Mohamad Nassir, who started service this year. “But I think we’re approachable. We listen to them a lot,” said the 22-year-old, the youngest of the officers. The officers’ hope is that the inmates do not fall into hopelessness. “No matter how many times (they’re incarcerated) – it can be the first or the fourth – at some (point), they’d realise that there’s someone who wants to help them,” said SGT 3 Alysa Naqeera. The journey to becoming an officer is not easy, however. The training at the Home Team Academy is the same for both genders, entailing the physical aspect, tactical skills as well as classroom lessons on legislation and prison rules. “At the end of every day, you just lie flat on your bed and you’re like, ‘Why did I do this?’ But it was what I expected,” recalled DSP 1 Hoo. Her parents are supportive, though her mother initially had some concerns about her safety and “continues to worry till this day, as mothers do”. “But she knows I’m doing well. I think they see that I’m happy, despite being tired,” said their daughter. “I guess the fulfilment shows on my face when I get home.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The officers have eight- to 12-hour working days. But it is also the “emotional journey” of steering the inmates and hearing their stories – of striving to live up to the tagline Captains of Lives – that can be draining. “Sometimes, as a woman, you feel for them. You can get angry on their behalf. At the same time, you have to bring them back and tell them to make the best of their time here,” said DSP 1 Hoo. But it takes just a thank you for the officers’ help to make the job rewarding, “simple and cliched as it sounds”, said SGT 3 Alysa Naqeera. “Just seeing that little happiness from them when we get to answer their questions makes me feel like, at least I did something good today.” Her boss added: “And when they see you’re willing to help them genuinely, they warm up to you. They respect you.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/singapore-women-prison-inmates-changi-institution-a4-guards-10625324"}, {"datetime": "18 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["cna insider", "conversation with", "china", "US"], "author": "Lua Jiamin", "title": "US-China relations moving in a “dangerous direction” over Taiwan, says China expert", "content": " SINGAPORE: A Chinese foreign policy expert has warned that the current United States administration’s apparent warming attitude towards Taiwan could cause US-China relations to become “very explosive”. Professor Jia Qingguo, who is the Dean of Peking University’s School of International Studies, pointed out: “The Trump administration – well at least the (US) Congress – has been very aggressive in terms of pushing the Taiwan issue. So as far as I can see, the US policy on Taiwan is moving in a dangerous direction.” On a scale of one to 10, he told the programme Conversation With, the danger levels “are near… (if) not crossing over five”. (Watch the episode here.) Prof Jia is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory body to the Chinese government. In December 2016, Mr Donald Trump, who was then the US President-elect, took a controversial phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. The call was the first contact in nearly four decades between a leader of Taiwan and an incumbent or incoming US President. It caused a diplomatic uproar in China, where some fear that Trump will roll back the longstanding “One China” policy which underpins US-China relations. China sees the self-ruled island of Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day, and the “One China” policy is the US’ diplomatic acknowledgement of China’s position that there is only one Chinese government. Adding fuel to the fire, Mr Trump signed into law two provocative bills that would forge closer ties between the US and Taiwan: The National Defense Authorization Act that allows for the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the US; and the Taiwan Travel Act which paved the way for mutual visits by US and Taiwan officials. Prof Jia cautioned: “If (Trump) acts on these things – if he sends a warship to Taiwan’s harbour, if he sends a senior official to Taiwan – I think the Taiwan issue will be very explosive. The China-US relationship would enter into a kind of confrontation mode. I’m not bluffing.” THE RED LINE In a pointed message to Taiwan in March, President Xi Jinping warned that “any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history”. Beijing has also stepped up its campaign to assert Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan in recent months: It ordered foreign airlines and businesses to stop referring to Taiwan as a nation on their websites. Three US airlines have bowed to the Chinese government’s demands. In response, Taiwan’s President Tsai has defiantly declared that “no one can obliterate Taiwan’s existence”.  Prof Jia noted that Taiwan “has been the most sensitive issue in the China-US relationship since the founding of the People’s Republic of China”. “This is an issue that no Chinese leader can take a step backwards. There is a red line there. So we hope that the (Trump) administration would understand and appreciate this,” he said. This interview was recorded on May 28, 2018.

This follows an in-house study that found that patients under such a team-based care model have better health outcomes. In a media briefing on Friday (Aug 17) where NHGP shared their findings, it attributed this result to the strong bond patients develop with their care teams. \"EVERY VISIT I SEE HIM, IT'S A JOY\" Mr Arul Subramaniam, 68, was diagnosed with diabetes six years ago, but his condition did not take a turn for the better until 2015 when the group rolled out team-based care for chronic patients. Mr Subramaniam, who started seeing the same doctor each time he visited the polyclinic, said it is all about the relationship. \"You can confide in him, even personal problems, other problems apart from medical. You can tell him and he will advise you which is good. And the prescription he gives you, you follow. Every visit I see him, it's a joy.  \"It's different from the previous doctors who are very strict. There's so much of care and concern,\" he said. Each care team has two doctors, a care manager who is a nurse, as well as support staff such as a care coordinator who follows up with patients on appointments.  The idea is to have a dedicated team monitor a patient holistically - from their medical to social needs.  BUILDING TRUST WITH PATIENTS Ahead of their first appointment, patients are scanned to see if they are suitable for the care model. They are then divided into different categories, ranging from simple to complex cases, depending on their medical conditions. This allows each care team to tailor its approach.  Once patients are on the programme, their well-being is tracked on a digital dashboard to see how treatment can be adjusted. For instance, a diabetic patient who does not show any improvement in his blood sugar level will be given an appointment with a dietician. Between July 2015 and end 2016, the group studied about 20,000 patients with chronic diseases, of which half were on team-based care.  Almost all patients in the study had high blood pressure while about 60 per cent were diabetic.  The group found that patients in dedicated care teams had better control over their diabetes and were less likely to visit the emergency department. Patients were also more likely to go for preventive health screenings.  \"We believe that we build on a patient's trust. Over time, the relationship is strengthened and this really goes a long way to empower our patients to take charge of their health, to have better self-awareness and to enable them to change their behaviour,\" said Dr Karen Ng, director of clinical services at NHGP. Across NHGP's six polyclinics, more than 100,000 patients with chronic conditions are being cared for by dedicated teams. The group aims to get all of such patients on board by mid-2019.  It currently has more than 200,000 patients that visit its polyclinics for chronic conditions.  The goal is to expand the service to family members of patients as certain chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes are hereditary.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chronic-patients-to-get-dedicated-care-teams-at-nhg-polyclinics-10627230"}, {"datetime": "17 Aug 2018 07:32PM", "tags": ["crime", "scam", "Haj"], "author": "Nurul Azliah Aripin", "title": "Well-known religious teacher charged with cheating in Haj tour scam", "content": " SINGAPORE: A well-known religious teacher was on Friday (Aug 17) charged with one count of cheating in a case involving a Haj travel package.

Launched in 2011 in Jakarta, Go-Jek - a play on the local word for motorbike taxis - has evolved from a ride-hailing service to a one-stop app allowing clients in Southeast Asia's largest economy to make online payments and order everything from food, groceries to massages. \"We're seeing enormous online to offline traction for all of our businesses and are close to being profitable, outside of transportation,\" said the 34-year old CEO. The startup is expected to be fully profitable \"probably\" within the next few years, Makarim added. Already a market leader in Indonesia, where it processes more than 100 million transactions for its 20-25 million monthly users, Go-Jek is now looking to expand in Southeast Asia. Ride hailing services in Southeast Asia are expected to surge to US$20.1 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025 from US$5.1 billion in 2017, according to a Google-Temasek report. Go-Jek said in May it would invest US$500 million to enter Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, after Uber struck a deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to Grab - the bigger player in the region. Go-Jek is seeing strong funding interest from its backers as it targets an aggressive expansion, Makarim said. \"Since its Aug 1 launch, the app has already grabbed 15 per cent of market share in Ho Chi Minh,\" Makarim said. The firm this week opened recruitment for motorcycle drivers in Thailand. The startup expects anti-monopoly concerns swirling around the Grab-Uber deal, which Singapore said had substantially hurt competition, to help clear a path for its expansion. \"We're bringing back choice. The Singapore government is particularly eager to bring back competition,\" Makarim said, adding that the order of overseas rollouts had not been set. OVERSEAS PUSH Go-Jek's offshore push comes at a time when Singapore-based Grab is stepping up funding to expand in Indonesia and transform itself into a consumer technology company, starting with a partnership with online grocer HappyFresh. \"Mimicking Go-Jek's strategy is the highest form of flattery,\" laughed Makarim. He believes Go-Jek's understanding of food merchants will give it an edge over Grab, which counts investors such as Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp among its backers. Makarim, who sees food delivery as Go-Jek's core business, said he was not concerned about funding, without giving details. Go-Jek was reported in June as being in talks to raise US$1.5 billion in a new funding round and was valued at about US$5 billion in a prior fundraising, sources have told Reuters. The firm had said in March it was considering a domestic IPO. Makarim noted Go-Jek's backers were sharing both capital and expertise. The company is collaborating with Alphabet Inc's Google on platform mobility, Tencent on payments strategy, JD.com on logistics operations, and Meituan Dianping on merchant transactions and deliveries.

Five other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. According to court documents, a female prostitute whom Goh engaged told him last March that \"there are always female prostitutes looking for units to rent for lodging and work\". The prostitute suggested that he rent a unit and sublet it to other prostitutes as he would be able to earn twice the amount of rental. After doing some research, Goh began posting advertisements on online platforms Carousell and Shi Cheng BBS. He asked for tenants to rent units under their names for him, directing people who responded to his ads to sign for tenancy agreements of units. He paid them between S$500 and S$800 in return. After obtaining the keys to the unit, Goh sublet the rooms to Chinese nationals who worked as prostitutes.

Heavy rain because of the tropical storm caused a dam in Laos to collapse, flooding villages.  “At the national level, the disaster management agencies of Laos worked with the military, local NGOs and regional partners.

The scholarship was launched in March this year to develop and nurture a pool of next-generation leaders who will spearhead the national digital transformation. It is jointly offered by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Government Technology Agency (GovTech), and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). “We will invest in our long-term engineering capabilities, to ensure that we have a core group of passionate innovators to lead and drive technology change, both within the civil service and across the private sector,” said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative. He pointed out that the Government had outsourced much of its software development services to other countries a decade ago, but that has since changed. Dr Balakrishnan added that attracting and retaining local talent was necessary as global competition for talent has never been stronger. The Smart Nation Scholarship recipients were selected through a rigorous assessment process comprising aptitude tests, management interviews, and agency-specific assessments. They will pursue undergraduate studies in information and communications technology (ICT)-related disciplines such as computer science, information security and mathematics at local and overseas universities. WOMEN IN TECH Ms Ong Jing Yin is one of two women awarded the scholarship. Noting that the industry is conventionally male-dominated, she revealed that people are usually surprised to find out her area of study. “Most people would say: ‘Why would a female join this field? Isn’t it for guys?’. But I would like to correct this stereotype because after studying computer science and learning more about it, women can be equally capable and contribute to this field too.\" She added that as cybersecurity becomes increasingly important, the ratio between men and women in her computer science course has improved. Ms Ong - who won the bronze award in the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp Competition last year - become cognizant of the immeasurable threats associated with hacking during the contest when her team’s assets were hijacked and used to infect all the other participants’ without their knowledge. “What if the hack was not just on my team, but a greater scale like an attack on Singapore? Many people could lose money, industries could be impacted,” she said.  ANSWERING A CYBER CALLING Less than stellar grades in secondary school derailed Mr Alan Low’s plans to go to a Junior College.  Noting his natural inclination towards technical subjects, his secondary school teacher advised Mr Low to consider the polytechnic route. \"In a way you could say this was a silver lining, because given that I had a very strong passion in IT, why not take a career in IT? This is the time where cybersecurity is the 'in' thing, with all the recent cyberattacks,\" he said. So Mr Low joined the information security diploma in Republic Polytechnic (RP), where he excelled and was on the RP Director’s Roll of Honours every year. He will enrol in NUS’s Information Security course and intends to pursue a career with the CSA. While data science, artificial intelligence and software development count among the hottest skills today, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that a strong cyber ecosystem needs to be fortified with lawyers and scientists as well. Unlike the rest of his peers, Mr Marcus Ho chose an unconventional path under the Smart Nation scholarship. He will read law at Cambridge, instead of pursuing an ICT-related degree. His choice of study comes after being inspired during his internship at Rajah & Tann. But Mr Ho admits that tech is still his first love. \"Growing up, tech was one of my passions. This has driven me to a critical intersection where I’d like to engage in a very niche area related to technology law and regulations,” he said.

Atika, who goes by one name, began working as a domestic helper in the victim's home in October last year. The girl's parents entrusted Atika, a 25-year-old Indonesian, with the task of caring for the girl, who has a developmental condition and is unable to talk. Atika physically abused the child at least five times between January and May this year. She did this because she \"got frustrated when taking care of her\", court documents said. At about 8pm on May 9, Atika was helping the child use the toilet when the victim vomited into the sink. Feeling unhappy with the child, Atika pinched her hard on the arm. The next day, she washed the child roughly during a shower and scratched her on the back. After showering, the girl urinated on the toilet floor. Atika was irritated by this and pinched the child hard on her upper lip, the court heard. Later that day, the girl's mother called the police, saying that Atika admitted to her that she had hit her child. \"She said she used a spoon to hit my child,\" said the mother. \"I have been noticing scars on my child.\" The girl was taken to a hospital, where a medical report listed several injuries she had suffered. These included two small fresh healing scars over the front of the neck, one abrasion over her upper lip, six abrasions on her forearm and a bruise over her shoulder blade. Atika pleaded guilty to two charges of ill-treating a child, with three charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kong Kuek Foo asked the judge to impose a sentence of 10 months' jail, saying that the victim was vulnerable and defenceless against the accused. \"Given her condition, she was unable to report the abuse she had suffered,\" said the prosecutor. \"Instead of discharging her duties as a caregiver, Atika abused the trust placed in her by physically abusing the victim.\" Atika was unrepresented but wrote a mitigation plea to the judge, saying that she was remorseful and knew she should not have done what she did.

Exports rose 11.8 per cent in July year-on-year, data from the trade agency Enterprise Singapore showed, accelerating from the revised 0.8 per cent rise the month before. This was better than the 6.7 per cent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll. NODX to seven of the top 10 NODX markets saw growth in July, unlike in June when only four NODX markets saw growth. The key drivers were the US, Japan and Indonesia, while the laggards were South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand.  On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports expanded 4.3 per cent in July after declining a revised 11.1 per cent in June. The poll called for a 0.2 per cent expansion from the month before. The better-than-expected jump was thanks to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, which rose 109.2 per cent in July from a year earlier. OCBC Bank's head of treasury research and strategy, Ms Selena Ling, said that July's NODX print marks a healthy start for Singapore's exports in the second half of the year. However, she also noted that pharmaceuticals output and exports can be rather volatile depending on the turnaround for each production cycle, therefore it is unclear how long this current uptick will sustain beyond the immediate few months ahead.

From the moment trailers of the movie began circulating online several months ago, it became clear that there were high expectations of director Jon M Chu’s screen adaptation of Singapore-born author Kevin Kwan’s bestselling novel about the lives of ultra-rich Chinese families in Singapore. Many have lauded it for being the first major Hollywood studio movie in 25 years to feature an all-Asian cast and believe it could herald a sea change in terms of how Hollywood deals with diversity. However, many have also censured it for not being an accurate representation of Singapore society. In fact, there are fears it might even fuel more pernicious caricatures and stereotypes of what Singapore, Singaporeans  and Asians are about. In this respect, indeed Crazy Rich Asians could be more damaging than helpful. However, let’s face it. The movie does not purport to be an accurate or holistic representation of Singapore society. It is, pure and simple, a romantic comedy about Crazy Rich Asians and generally, comedic films play off caricatures. Considering this, should we really have such high expectations and repeatedly condemn the movie for not meeting them? Seeing caricatures and stereotypes of one’s society is naturally frustrating, and this wouldn’t be the first time that Singapore is misrepresented in the movies or on television. We often rightfully worry about how the world will see us if these depictions are all they are exposed to. But if we took a step back, we might see that the solutions to this are not completely out of reach. WHY REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT Popular culture and the arts can help us understand ourselves, our societies and facilitate such understanding for societies elsewhere. Singaporean filmmaker Kelvin Tong, in a recent On the Record interview, discussed how seeing Singapore on film in Jack Neo’s Money No Enough several years ago moved him immensely. Not only did I see Singapore on the big screen, I heard Singapore on the big screen. There’s a certain satisfaction to that. Asian stories need to be told, but stopping at a single story could have injurious effects on not just others’ views of us, but our own views of the places and communities we live in. While the onus is partly on individuals to seek out diverse stories for consumption, there is clearly a need to create these stories in the first place. A SINGLE STORY CANNOT BE AN ANTIDOTE  Most movies aren’t fully representative of the societies they portray. For instance, we don't expect a single Hollywood movie set in the US to represent every facet of American society. What America has going for it is a variety and volume of work. Each work portrays a different facet of society. It is this variety, seen as a whole, that has the potential of reflecting a more authentic picture. Instead of desiring any one story to be an antidote for Asian and Singaporean stereotypes, we need to think about how to encourage more Asian and Singaporean work that can collectively represent our societies more holistically on the local and global stage. TELL AND RECOGNISE DIVERSE STORIES BY DIVERSE PEOPLE It’s about who tells the stories, how they are told and also how often they are told. Other artists I’ve spoken with recently in On the Record interviews have expressed as much. Award-winning Singaporean filmmaker, K Rajagopal expressed his frustration at a dearth of stories about racial minority groups on the big screen and on stage. “There were local plays with minority characters but I think they were caricatures. There was no identity, no proper representation. I’m Indian and I’m Singaporean but when I looked around, there was nothing about my community or where I came from, what I’m familiar with, the language, or the people.” His solution was to create his own work. He was also quick to explain that he has no expectations of others to do so. “If a Chinese writer feels that they want to write about their own experience and that does not include a non-Chinese person, you can’t force them to create work for the purpose of being inclusive. You have to stand up and create your own work.” TOWARDS A MORE COMPLETE NARRATIVE Actor and filmmaker, Glen Goei who is also Co-Artistic Director of one of Singapore’s leading professional theatre companies, Wild Rice, echoed this sentiment during our interview. He has had his own battles with international film agents who subscribe to Asian stereotypes. His movie, Blue Mansion was ignored by them simply because it featured Chinese Singaporeans speaking English. “They are not used to Chinese people speaking English. It’s a stereotype which has been perpetuated over the years. They couldn’t imagine Singaporeans speaking good English.” But instead of cowing to pressure, he went ahead and kept in English. For him, the film was a powerful representation of the world he grew up in. “I wasn’t going to make the film in Mandarin because that’s not the world I grew up in. That’s not the world I live in.” This proves another point. Singapore, like any other place in the world, is not a monolith. Each of our experiences in this country is distinct. Goei grew up in an English-speaking environment. You might have grown up in a largely Hokkien-speaking or Malay-speaking Singapore. Goei’s Blue Mansion is simply representative of one facet of Singapore and he acknowledges it. Let’s also acknowledge that a movie like Crazy Rich Asians is not and cannot be a definitive depiction of what and who we are. We can censure such depictions, but criticism alone provides few solutions. We must take it upon ourselves to tell more stories. To ensure that these stories are heard, we also have to believe enough in ourselves to create and support a variety of work that demands local and global attention to form a more complete narrative of who we are.

Before that, I laid out some targets and luckily enough, we achieved them last year.” This includes meeting a profit target set for the firm’s 20th year and exceeding it by more than 20 per cent, according to Mr Pang. Koufu also renewed the lease for its premium food court brand at Marina Bay Sands, and secured approval to rent an industrial property in Woodlands. The latter will be home to a 20,000-sq-m integrated facility that Koufu is betting on to fire up growth. The success of Kimly – the first publicly listed traditional coffee shop operator in Singapore – also had some effect, Mr Pang replied candidly when asked. A favourite among market analysts, Kimly shares have risen more than 30 per cent above its initial public offering (IPO) price since debuting on the Catalist board last March. “I don’t deny that I was somewhat influenced by them,” the entrepreneur said. “A favourable performance for F&B businesses in the stock market did set me thinking.”  MORE THAN JUST A FOOD COURT CHAIN Koufu, a name that has since become synonymous with food courts, started 16 years ago after Mr Pang sold his coffee shop chain Aik Hua and decided to cash in on the growing demand for air-conditioned food courts in the heartlands. From the first location in Toa Payoh Central, it has since expanded to 47 food courts in Singapore catering to different market segments, such as the premium Rasapura Masters and halal-focused Fork & Spoon. Koufu also runs a food court in Macau. Its outlet and mall management business also includes a chain of 14 coffee shops, Jurong West Hawker Centre and Punggol Plaza. Under its F&B retail business, which contributes slightly more than half to overall group revenue, Koufu owns 81 F&B stalls, five F&B kiosks like bubble tea brand R&B Tea, as well as 14 restaurants. Altogether, Koufu whipped up a net profit of S$26.8 million and revenue of S$216.7 million last year. Its shares have thus far moved up from its IPO price of S$0.63 – a performance that Mr Pang said has put him more at ease. He admitted that he felt “disappointed” when the stock finished flat on its debut. “I even asked why it turned out this way but they told me not to worry or be bothered by this. The company is fundamentally sound and all I have to do is to focus on what I need to do.” Describing the listing as a “brand new start”, Mr Pang said the company will look to deepen its corporate management and is hungry for more growth. It has been actively filling up new senior management roles, with one already being tasked to oversee the building of the integrated facility due to be completed in 2020. This seven-storey building, which is allocated about S$30 million of IPO proceeds, will house a central kitchen and dishwashing facility, as well as a research and development centre among other things. Mr Pang highlighted this as the project that he is most looking forward to. For one, a bigger central kitchen will help to boost productivity and operational efficiency. Koufu is also eyeing potential collaboration with other food manufacturers to produce semi-finished or finished food products for third-party businesses. “It will be a modernised central kitchen with new technology systems, as well as one that fosters cooperation,” explained Mr Pang. “For example, we can bring in other companies to make products that can be sold to other businesses, apart from being supplied to our own food courts and coffee shops. We’ve been a business-to-consumer (B2C) company but we can start having a business-to-business (B2B) model too.” The new facility is also set to give Koufu another modern update to its operations, following the roll-out of smart tray return robots and mobile ordering apps at its F&B locations. Even as it remains in a traditional industry, Mr Pang stressed that the business has to move with the times. He declined, however, to reveal the amount spent on technology-driven initiatives thus far. “You may not be able to reap the benefits now but that doesn’t mean that it is something we can ignore.” Meanwhile, overseas expansion is also on Koufu’s plate. Mr Pang said talks are underway to launch brands, such as R&B Tea and Elemen, in markets including China, Malaysia and Australia. It remains more cautious, however, when it comes to exporting its food courts overseas. This boils down to the huge costs involved and the fact that food courts are still a foreign concept beyond Singapore. When Koufu first set up shop in Macau’s Sands Cotai Central in 2012, it battled with a host of challenges from finding suitable vendors to having a menu that would appeal to the local taste buds. “We went in with the Singapore model but did not know how to make adjustments,” said Mr Pang. “We had to endure a few challenging years before turning around the situation in what was a money-losing business. “We will not rule out food courts (in our overseas plans) but we will be very careful because of the huge investment needed.” “I’M NOT DONE GROWING KOUFU YET”  When asked how he would build up investor confidence and assuage some concerns from analysts about the company wading into unfamiliar territory with capital-intensive projects, Mr Pang stressed that these plans are key in ensuring Koufu grows sustainably. “Being in a traditional industry, it hasn’t been an easy journey for us to develop to where we are,” he said. “With our new business plans underway, we will continue to evolve. Though I can’t predict the scale, I believe we will become a sustainable enterprise.” The chief executive also revealed that he had turned down a buyer keen on acquiring Koufu last year. “If we have a plan for the company that can bring about sustainable growth, why should I sell it?” he said, though he declined to reveal details about the buyer and the offer. “I’m not done growing Koufu yet.” This emphasis on growth and adapting to changes has been a constant theme in Mr Pang’s life. Before becoming a hawker and starting Aik Hua, he spent more than 10 years as a vendor at the now-defunct Sungei Road flea market. “I started when I was 13. Sungei Road was where I grew up … Over the years, I’ve sold everything from watches, toys, fruits to chicken rice.” While the memories as a street vendor – even if it involved being on constant lookout for the police as he did not have a licence for a couple of years - never fail to bring a smile to Mr Pang’s face, they were borne out of unhappy circumstances. Mr Pang’s father died when he was 13. His mother’s pay as a labourer at a wood manufacturing factory was never enough for the family of eight. “We were poor and no work means no food on the table,” he recounted. “I was the second child but the eldest son. After a few months at secondary school, I told my mother I wanted to start working.” He found work as the assistant of a street hawker at Sungei Road. “I was running around making deliveries every day so I knew everyone. Maybe I was young so all of them treated me well. “During my breaks, I’ll pop by the stalls to chat with different people or just observe how people bargained or made a deal. I learnt a lot.” The hustle and bustle of a thriving, maze-like flea market could have been intimidating for others his age but not for Mr Pang. “I wouldn’t think of it as tough … In fact, without the experiences there, I wouldn’t be who I am today.” When asked about his recipe for success, the entrepreneur said his only guiding principle is to never stop learning. For what he lacked in paper qualifications, he made up for it through his voracious appetite for reading. The Fifth Discipline published in 1990 by management guru Peter Sanges is one of Mr Pang’s favourite books. “It changed the perception of learning by talking about how people needed to be proactive and learn continuously so as to achieve results. He also mentioned how there’s a need to change your mental models and reflect on the presumptions that influence your actions. “And that’s what I think is important: Whatever you do, be brave to make changes and never give up on learning something new.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/koufu-foodcourt-ipo-overseas-expansion-10610696"}, {"datetime": "17 Aug 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Singapore Night Festival"], "author": "Jeremy Long", "title": "In pictures: Interactive Night Light installations at the Singapore Night Festival 2018", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos  SINGAPORE: This year’s Singapore Night Festival kicks off this weekend with the interactive Night Lights installations.

The Public Service can only succeed if it is built on trust; trust that public officers will uphold Singapore’s best interests,\" she said. \"We must serve with empathy, and put the needs of others before ourselves,” she added. The President’s scholarship is the highest accolade to be given to an undergraduate, and is typically awarded to students with a strong ethos for public service. It is awarded in addition to another public sector scholarship, such as the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Scholarship, Singapore Police Force (SPF) Scholarship and the Public Service Commission (PSC) Scholarship. This year's recipients are SPF scholars Inspector Alden Tan and Inspector Stefan Liew, SAF scholar Officer Cadet Sharmaine Koh and PSC scholars Penny Shi and Tan Xin Hwee. RESILIENCE AND EMPATHY For 19-year-old Sharmaine Koh, growing up in an extended family of boys saw many of their conversations inevitably revolve around the army. And since she couldn’t beat them, she joined them. Her uncle, for example, was in the armor unit, a vocation that she will be joining when she returns from her studies at Yale University. “I thought to myself, 'if I feel that defending the country was very important ... if not me to defend, then who else?'” she said. The officer cadet is among 22 female recipients awarded scholarships by the Singapore Armed Forces and Defence Ministry this year - a number that MINDEF said has doubled from a decade ago. Sharmaine will study history and politics at Yale, two subjects she believes will help inform her decisions as a strategist and leader in the army. \"A lot of things - like our geopolitical realities, why Singapore makes policy the way it does - is very much informed by our historical experiences. (History and politics) also shapes the national psyche, so I felt that (those subjects) will be able to help me formulate more appropriate and meaningful policies.” Sharmaine’s degree of choice is a surprising one, considering her less-than-stellar history grade at Hwa Chong Institution. But regular coaching sessions by her history teacher helped her understand how the subject is applicable to the present, and she gradually excelled in it. FINDING THE CONNECTION Meanwhile, 19-year-old Tan Xin Hwee, who is from Raffles Institution, feels a need to connect with the characters in her life. The Public Service Commission scholar, who will be pursuing a degree in philosophy and psychology at Oxford University, has stepped into the shoes of a wide spectrum of characters over her seven years in theatre. “The process of crafting theatre is essentially an exercise in empathy. When you borrow these notes you learn in theatre, you’ll see that people around you have very varied needs. They have different experiences from you, but still have needs that are very important,” Xin Hwee said. \"In public service, when you're crafting policies, there's a very human aspect to it. You really need to understand the people you are trying to help, otherwise you will be addressing needs that don't exist, and you're going to spend a lot of resources on things that people don't actually need.\" Philosophy and psychology are subjects that she believes will help her reach out to the public more effectively. “Many times, policies are created with the intention of helping people on the ground. But the benefit may not be always so apparent to them. I hope to value-add by applying an overarching perspective and critical thinking skills to dissect policies and address needs more accurately,” she said. Xin Hwee eventually hopes to contribute to the education and social services sector.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/future-leaders-dedication-humility-president-scholarship-10622304"}, {"datetime": "16 Aug 2018 07:51PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Changi Airport Group chairman suspected maid of stealing for years, but tolerated her behaviour", "content": " SINGAPORE: Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong had long suspected that his maid had been stealing items from his family home, but he \"tolerated\" her behaviour, he told the court on Thursday (Aug 16). Mr Liew was testifying in an ongoing trial of his former maid, Indonesian Parti Liyani, who is accused of stealing items worth more than S$50,000 from his family. \"My secretary worked for me for 36 years,\" Mr Liew said. \"My driver worked for me for 15 years. I don't let people go unless there is a reason. I tend to overtrust.\" The maid had worked with the Liew family for eight years, until they began suspecting that the 44-year-old had been stealing their belongings. They fired her in October 2016. The alleged stolen items include two Longchamp bags belonging to Mr Liew, a damaged Gerald Genta watch valued at S$25,000 and a S$1,000 Prada bag. After firing her, the family opened three boxes that she had left behind to be couriered to Indonesia, and found the missing items inside it.  Mr Liew filed a police report that same month and Parti was arrested in December 2016 when she returned to Singapore to seek employment. LIEW MUN LEONG HAS A 'PROPENSITY FOR BAGS' On Thursday, the 72-year-old, who is also the founding president of CapitaLand Group, told the court that he had \"a propensity for bags\". He objected to defence lawyer Anil Balchandani's assertion that two of the missing bags had been discarded, and it was Parti who retrieved them.  \"I don't think so. I cannot imagine somebody would throw it away,\" he said. Mr Liew said his wife would give some items that he no longer wanted to his son Karl, before disposing of them or giving them away to charity if he did not want them. Mr Balchandani alleged that his wife would also offer Mr Liew's discarded items to Parti. Mr Liew said this was \"not possible as she knows I love bags\". \"She would have talked to me,\" he said. \"She is a very stingy and frugal person so I really cannot imagine her discarding them.\" Mr Balchandani then said: \"You have so many bags. What do you do with them?\" Mr Liew joked: \"That's also something I'm thinking (about). (I) can start a bag shop.\" However, he insisted that he hardly discards any bags, despite buying new ones. DEFENCE ASKS IF MR LIEW OFTEN MISPLACED HIS ITEMS The pair tussled over several other issues, such as Mr Balchandani's suggestion that Mr Liew could have misplaced the allegedly stolen items.  At one point, Mr Balchandani asked: \"Is it possible that you have a lot of things and you misplaced a lot of things? You would, also, after misplacing things, find them?\" Mr Liew's reply: \"Most of us can't find our handphone, can't find our keys.\" The defence lawyer then asked him if he had misplaced a hearing aid worth S$1,000 in or around 2014. \"No, it cost S$11,000,\" Mr Liew answered, before agreeing that he misplaces his hearing aid \"quite often\". Mr Balchandani said that the device was found by Parti, and asked if Mr Liew accused her of taking it. \"I don't think I will accuse her, because the hearing aid is a personal item,\" he said. \"My point is that most of the time something is missing, you will blame Parti,\" charged Mr Balchandani. Mr Liew objected strongly: \"Not true. This is rubbish.\" He also denied that he was accusing Parti of stealing to \"fix\" her. \"There is no motivation for a person like me to go against a maid,\" said Mr Liew. \"I am trying to avoid (her coming back to steal things) for the good of Singapore.\" The defence put it to Mr Liew that if Parti had wanted to steal, she would have taken one of his expensive watches. \"No,\" said Mr Liew. \"The watches are in my safe, and I think those items would have been very glaringly missing if they were stolen.\" The trial resumes on Friday.

Over the past few years, a growing number of these mystery box machines have popped up across the island. One example is Takara Box, which offers customers the chance of getting gaming consoles, laptops and luxury handbags for just S$5. Takara Box vending machines can be found in at least 15 locations across Singapore, including at shopping malls like Plaza Singapura, The Star Vista and Tampines 1. But the police said that merchants who operate vending machines that dispense random mystery prizes upon receipt of cash payments\" in public places are breaking the law. \"As this is a form of public lottery, it is an offence under Section 5(a) of the Common Gaming Houses Act,\" it said. \"Existing merchants operating such vending machines are advised to cease these operations.

Takara Box did not respond to queries on its Facebook page or calls to a number it provided on the page.  However, it said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that it is \"upgrading\" its service and will return \"soon\" with a new concept, without elaborating. It is unclear if this is in response to the police advisory.

Criminal lawyer Sunil Sudheesan told Channel NewsAsia establishments might be unaware that such machines run afoul of the law. As these machines involve an element of chance, he explained, they are considered public lottery. Those who use the machines can also be caught and prosecuted, Mr Sudheesan said, referring to Section 8 of the Common Gaming Houses Act. Nevertheless, criminal lawyer Luke Lee said the police should not enforce it if the machine deals in stakes that are not high. He said: \"It may technically be a crime, but who does it harm?\" Mr Sudheesan said while the machines should be regulated, \"licences should be given out upon application so that this can be monitored\".

This includes tender-related documents submitted through government e-procurement portal GeBIZ. The initiative is one of two that the Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) announced on Thursday (Aug 16) to streamline regulatory requirements and reduce compliance costs for business-to-government (B2G) transactions. According to quotations given by five customised stamp makers in Singapore, one rectangular- or circular-shaped stamp that is smaller than the palm costs an average of S$30. The initiative comes after feedback that the requirement for the sole purpose of identity verification was “outdated and unnecessary”. Companies gave feedback that the process was “cumbersome and time-consuming” since they had to download, print, physically stamp, scan the documents and then send it back to agencies by email. The removal of the stamping requirement also comes as other forms of verification, like digital platforms and signatures, now provide alternatives to the traditional method, as the government moves towards the digitalisation of services. The other initiative by the PEP removes the requirement for the submission of audited statements when companies with an annual sales turnover of less than S$5 million want to apply for, or renew their Government Supplier Registration status. From June this year, these companies were already able to submit unaudited financial statement with underwriting for registration. According to the Ministry of Finance and PEP, the initiative was welcomed by small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and is expected to benefit an estimated 3,900 suppliers. Companies have given feedback that the requirement to provide an audited statement was costly to businesses, in particular for SMEs which have an annual turnover of less than S$5 million, according to authorities.  With this initiative, companies do not have to furnish the same documents each time a government agency requires them to provide financial information when they bid for a tender.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/companies-not-required-to-stamp-government-forms-from-october-10622128"}, {"datetime": "16 Aug 2018 04:14PM", "tags": ["health", "Health Sciences Authority"], "author": "", "title": "Slimming products Body Slim Herbal, Sparkle Twins contain banned substance: HSA", "content": " SINGAPORE: Two slimming products - Body Slim Herbal and Sparkle Twins - have been found to contain the banned substance sibutramine, said the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Thursday (Aug 16).

The result is healthier food that stays fresh longer, said NTU on Thursday (Aug 16). Researchers found that by adding genes of a plant to baker’s yeast, it produces natural preservatives with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties – two key elements of preservatives that prevents bacteria growth. “This organic food preservative is derived from plants and produced from food-grade microbes, which means that it is 100 per cent natural and more effective than artificial preservatives,” said Professor William Chen, director of NTU’s Food Science and Technology programme. NTU said tests carried on meat and fruit juice showed that the natural preservative kept samples fresh for two days without refrigeration. On the other hand, the samples with artificial food preservatives became contaminated with bacteria within six hours. The study comes amid growing scrutiny on the health risks of consuming food, especially meat products, with artificial preservatives. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for instance, expressed concern last month about chemical preservatives such as nitrates and nitrites, which it said can interfere with thyroid hormone production. The chemicals have also been linked to gastrointestinal and nervous system cancers. NTU said its team of scientists is in talks with multinational companies to further develop the new food preservative, and hopes that it will be available commercially within two years. “This may open new doors in food preservation technologies, providing a low-cost solution for industries, which will in turn encourage a sustainable food production system that can produce healthier food that stays fresh longer,” said Prof Chen.

However, more often than not, the restaurant is privately owned and hence, not listed on a stock exchange. However, a private stock exchange, which is described by Mr David Kuo, CEO of the Motley Fool Singapore, and Mr Robson Lee, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn, as a stock exchange for privately held companies, could give rise to the possibility that you could own shares in that favourite restaurant of yours. Mr Kuo and Mr Lee further described a private stock exchange as a market mechanism for shareholders of a private company to sell or buy more shares. For example, employers and employees who may be given shares in a private company could use the platform to liquidate or partially liquidate their shareholdings, by having an interested investor buy over them. Typically, for these shareholders to liquidate their holdings, they would have to wait for an initial public offering (IPO). Mr Kuo said another appeal a private stock exchange has is that it provides private companies access to capital, whereby companies need not go for a full listing on the Singapore Exchange but can still reach out to thousands of potential investors. “Many companies don't want to take that leap from being a privately owned business into becoming a full listed company so this way is almost like a halfway house where they can list onto a softer exchange and raise the capital that they want,\" he said. “And when they find their own feet and they think: I’m quite comfortable having outside shareholders. Then, they could actually take that second leap and become a fully listed company.\" According to Mr Kuo, this would have a positive effect for the Singapore Exchange because the bourse would see its IPO pipeline grow as a result. As such, Mr Lee said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) should take steps to prepare for and embrace this new development. “This is so that we will still be able to enable high tech companies to come here and raise funds, and set up shop, for investors to acquire stakes in potentially profitable companies,\" he said. For example, the likes of Facebook, Alibaba and companies which are going to be major players in their industries and markets.\" ARE PRIVATE STOCK EXCHANGES AUTHORISED TO OPERATE HERE? A MAS spokesman said: \"An entity that operates a platform to facilitate secondary trading of securities is required to be licensed as a recognised market operator under the Securities and Futures Act.” The authority also expects all entities to be responsible for ensuring that their activities comply with all relevant laws. The statement by MAS came after crowdfunding firm FundedHere had to put the brakes on its planned private stock exchange FundedX, because FundedX hasn't been authorised as a \"recognised market operator\" by the central bank. FundedHere clarified on Aug 2 that FundedX is not a \"private stock exchange\" as it initially claimed, but instead, is one where buyers and sellers can register their interests to buy or sell a particular company stock at the pre-determined price set by FundedX. FundedHere had initially described FundedX as a \"new private stock exchange to facilitate the trading of shares of high-growth startups and privately held companies in South-east Asia\". 1exchange is a similar platform to FundedX that facilitates the trading of private securities, and it is backed by investment syndication platform CapBridge and SGX.  However, when asked about its stance on private stock exchanges, SGX declined to comment. FAIR SHARE OF RISKS INVOLVED All in, Mr Kuo and Mr Lee agreed that there is a fair amount of risk involved when investing on private stock exchanges. For one, the private firms on the exchange are under no obligation to report their financial results quarterly. Mr Lee said: “Such companies in a private stock market will not be subjected to the disclosure regime that applies to all publicly listed companies.  \"They would not have safeguards like audit committees for example, which are imposed by the listing rules of a stock market. The lack of timely disclosure obligation could be a huge risk factor for investors who would want to enter into such investment transactions.” Mr Kuo pointed out that the lack of scrutiny is a huge concern, especially when it comes to startups because investors will not be able to tell if the company is financially sustainable. “The statistics for startup companies is not really that great,\" he said.  \"Nine out of ten of them will fail, so out of ten companies you might put money in, only one will succeed. If you like those kind of odds, then this kind of platform is probably good for you.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/private-stock-exchanges-singapore-what-are-they-10621658"}, {"datetime": "16 Aug 2018 01:59PM", "tags": ["animals", "wildlife"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Strong support for tougher wildlife protection laws in Singapore: Survey", "content": " SINGAPORE: There is strong support for tougher wildlife protection laws in Singapore, according to findings from a REACH survey released on Thursday (Aug 16). The online survey had questions drawn from amendments proposed for the Wild Animals and Birds Act (WABA) by the Wild Animals Legislation Review Committee (WALRC). The committee, formed by Member of Parliament for Nee Soon GRC Louis Ng in February, is made up of stakeholders from the nature community, pest control companies, religious organisations, town councils and grassroots organisations. The survey was posted on Government feedback site REACH from June to July and received over 1,000 responses and comments.  Among the findings, 81 per cent of respondents felt that the release of animals without a permit should be disallowed.  Seventy per cent felt that the feeding of wild animals should not be allowed.   According to the report, 61 per cent felt that all wild birds including crows, mynas, and pigeons should also be protected from being killed, kept or captured without a permit.  Eighty-one per cent felt that the deployment of nets and traps outside private premises and nature reserves should be regulated.  The findings also revealed 57 per cent felt that selected citizens should be given the power to assist the Government in enforcement, while 66 per cent felt that current penalties are inadequate in deterring individual offenders.  Ninety per cent felt that the penalties for repeat offenders should be more severe, and 89 per cent felt that the penalties for corporations should be more severe than for individuals.  Eighty per cent felt that organisations need to be specifically trained and licensed if they wish to provide wildlife removal services.  Eighty-three per cent supported having a code of conduct for wildlife photography, while 89 per cent wanted a code of conduct for general activities in nature areas.  PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO WABA The committee proposed 10 amendments to the WABA ranging from suggestions to ban the feeding of wild animals throughout Singapore as well as banning the release of animals without a license throughout Singapore. The initial amendments proposed by WALRC have been tweaked according to the observations gathered from the latest public feedback.   For example, the amendments included selected marine invertebrates such as horseshoe crabs and corals for protection after input from the marine biology research community.  The committee also deliberated initially on a total ban of possessing traps in public but tempered its stance after public feedback that it would be troublesome for researchers, recreational fishers and pet owners. The proposed amendment was revised to a lighter ban of deploying traps for all wild animals and birds by unqualified individuals. During a media briefing, Mr Ng added that the amendment to prevent unauthorised trapping is targeted at poachers, who have made use of loopholes in the current version of WABA to capture certain birds. Six species of birds, including the house crow, common myna, and white vented myna are excluded from current protection laws.  \"A lot of times on the ground when you go to someone trapping the bird, the fellow will say, 'I'm just trapping a common myna' and there's nothing we can do because trapping a common myna under WABA is legal,\" he said.  These amendments will be subjected to further public consultation and discussions with stakeholders in October before being presented in Parliament next year.  “Currently, animals receive a full suite of protection when they are in nature reserves and national parks. The problem is that the animal loses some protection once the animal leaves the nature reserves and national parks,\" said Mr Ng, who also chairs the WALRC. \"This is the gap we are trying to fill in the amendments to the WABA. Ultimately, the animals don’t know where the boundaries of the nature reserves and national parks lie, and the same animal should receive the same protection regardless of where the animal is.\" The proposed amendments will also align WABA with other nature-related legislation, which feature stronger penalties and protection for wildlife, Mr Ng said.  The WABA is the principal legislation that protects wildlife in Singapore and was enacted in 1965, with its last revision in 2000. While there have been seven revisions to WABA, Mr Ng said that they are \"consequential revisions\" to WABA due to revisions to amendments made to the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority Act, and were not specific to WABA.  \"If you look at the WABA at this point, it's just focusing on kill, keep and take. But if you look at other pieces of legislation under the Parks and Trees Act, it also includes release, feed and disturb. We have the first three now in WABA, and we're trying to add three more to make sure the animal receives similar protection regardless of where the animal is,\" Mr Ng.  \"Things have changed a lot in Singapore [since 1965]. The landscape has changed a lot. So the legislation has to be updated and changed,\" he added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wildlife-protection-laws-in-singapore-louis-ng-10620890"}, {"datetime": "16 Aug 2018 12:25PM", "tags": ["Singapore Police Force", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Man honoured for helping police nab upskirt video suspect at Marsiling MRT station", "content": " SINGAPORE: A man was given the Singapore Police Force's Public Spiritedness Award on Thursday (Aug 16) for his part in helping capture an upskirt video suspect last month.  Mr Goh Tong En was on an escalator at Marsiling MRT station on Jul 27 when he noticed that the man in front of him had placed a mobile phone underneath a woman's skirt.  Mr Goh approached the 27-year-old and detained him at the station, according to the news release.  \"Commuters are advised to be vigilant to their surroundings when travelling in the public transport network,\" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Evon Ng, who is Deputy Commander of Public Transport Security Command.  \"Besides being able to prevent themselves from becoming victims of crime, they can also help the police keep the public transport network safe by becoming our eyes and ears on the ground,\" she added, thanking Mr Goh for his display of public spiritedness.  \"Such acts go a long way to help deter crime on the public transport network.” Mr Goh's efforts were recognised in a ceremony at the Public Transport Security Command. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-award-catch-upskirt-video-suspect-marsiling-mrt-10621290"}, {"datetime": "16 Aug 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["retirement", "savings", "CPF", "eldely", "work"], "author": "Patrick Chang", "title": "Commentary: Saving too little, starting too late, do we have enough for retirement?", "content": " SINGAPORE: John Ng, aged 40, plans to retire at 65 with S$3,000 monthly to spend in real terms. He hopes to enjoy such an income in his old age for 20 years. By the time he retires, he must set aside a retirement sum of almost S$1.15 million, assuming a long-term inflation rate of 3 per cent.  What can John do now? CPF LIFE, INSURANCE TERM POLICIES PROVIDE OPTIONS  John is a member of the CPF LIFE scheme, which is a compulsory annuity plan that pays out lifelong income. He is confident he can meet the full retirement sum of S$181,000 when he retires.  Depending on CPF Board’s pending projections, that probably provides a lifelong guaranteed monthly payout of slightly over S$1,500. But this is still short of his ideal S$3,000. To reach a payout of S$3,000 a month, John must invest S$10,100 a year assuming an annualised return of 8 per cent. If he had started his retirement investment five years earlier, he would have only needed to invest S$6,510 annually with the same annualised returns. But if the annualised returns is only 6 per cent, then he has to invest slightly more than S$13,600 every year to achieve his retirement financial goal. Another option for John is a retirement income plan which insurance companies offer but these usually do not provide lifelong income. Although they come with lower risks, they may also have lower returns compared to other investment options. A third option would be the Supplementary Retirement Scheme, which provides an account that allows for investment gains to accumulate tax-free and tax relief for contributions to the account. STARTING TOO LATE  John’s example highlights the arduous challenges most people must confront as we plan for our retirement. A 2014 survey by DBS Bank showed that many Singaporeans aged 18 to 29 are saving late and not enough. 73 per cent of respondents polled said they plan to retire between 55 and 65, yet 85 per cent also expect to live on retirement income of S$3,500 per month. The same survey also found that while providing for retirement is a priority for 76 per cent of respondents, only 49 per cent have a financial plan. When so many of us put off planning for our retirement, we give ourselves a shorter runway to grow our retirement fund. Most of us only think about retirement after 40. Surveys have also shown most Singapore workers have only their CPF savings to depend on for their retirement. Yet, as we have seen from John’s case, the payout from the CPF LIFE scheme may not be sufficient to meet your retirement income needs, unless you are prepared to review your lifestyle.  To overcome these issues, one option is to invest more aggressively. But this is a risky move if we start too late, as it gives little time to regroup our portfolios and recoup losses, if the investment tide turns. The best time to begin retirement planning is when you get your first salary. But few individuals do that because retirement planning is not a priority – funding a home, paying for the kids’ education or going away on holiday might be more acute financial imperatives for many of us. Yet many of us recognise that we ignore our retirement needs at our own peril. A survey done in 2015, found that two thirds of surveyed retirees wished they have started their retirement plans earlier. ARE YOU SAVING TOO LITTLE? Even after we start planning, most of us may save too little. Attitudes to retirement study by BlackRock found more than half are still unsure how much they truly require for their retirement. Without the necessary knowledge and tools, they will either guess or apply heuristics, such as using current expenses to estimate their retirement needs. But any sum estimated is likely to be insufficient, as they negate external factors, such as the impact of inflation. In 20 years, today’s S$100 would only be worth S$54, assuming an annual 3 per cent inflation. John may have assumed that he only needs S$720,000 (S$3,000 monthly x 20 years) for his retirement. But in real terms with inflation, it means he actually needs to set aside an additional S$430,000. Many also tend to be overly optimistic about their physical and mental well-being, and overlook making provisions for additional medical expenses incurred in old age. START NOW, BE BOLD It is better to start earlier but it’s never too late to begin. We can all take the first step by adopting a mindset change and make retirement planning one of our top priorities necessary to ensure we retire comfortably, instead of seeing it as something we do only after our other financial obligations have been squared away. I often tell people that we need to apply the Law of the Farm when thinking about retirement adequacy. Like the planting of trees and harvesting of apples, investment needs time to grow.  The earlier we begin, the more we might have for retirement. Time is investment’s best friend, as compound returns over time will grow your investment many folds.        Some level of discipline can introduce greater consciousness and thoughtfulness into how much we set aside for our retirement. Perhaps think of having different bank accounts.  One blunt but systematic way is to funnel your income into different bank accounts for savings, expenses, investment, children education funds, retirement funds, and so forth. Each account then has a clear purpose and specific objectives. You also must not withdraw from other accounts, if one has been depleted. Applying some system discipline can help us all manage our finances more effectively.  Even the most financially savvy of us can benefit from seeking independent and professional financial advice, to better understand our current financial position, our future financial needs and the best options that provide payouts at critical junctures in our lives. The mapping of a comprehensive financial road map, and pinpointing with finer precision of how much we need after retirement, with regular reviews of that amount, can help us gain control over our retirement finances. FOREST, NOT TREES Retirement is an important phase of our lives often overlooked for several decades because of a lack of an urgency to plan. Immediate needs, such as building one’s career and grooming children, take centre-stage but it need not be a zero-sum game. Let’s not miss the forest for the trees. We can all start today to plant the seeds for the fruits we need in our old age.

Their suggestions include training more frontline staff in and beyond the healthcare sector to recognise the signs of depression and suicide risk, encouraging more employers to hire older workers and for families and the community not to make light of any talk of suicide by anyone.

Figures show the that 129 elderly people in Singapore committed suicide last year, six cases more than in 2016. While the number has gone up, the suicide rate among this group has in fact fallen over the years, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. Except for a slight increase compared to 2016, the suicide rate of 16.4 per 100,000 people aged 65 and above in 2017 was lower than the rates in the several years preceding that. Singapore’s suicide rates were also lower than Hong Kong, where the suicide rate for people over 65 in the city stood at 24.2 per 100,000 people in 2016, and South Korea, where there were 78.1 deaths by suicide per 100,000 population aged over 80 years in 2016.  KEEP THE ELDERLY EMPLOYED Still, experts said that one suicide is a suicide too many. Senior lecturer in the Master and PhD in Gerontology programmes at the Singapore University of Social Sciences Helen Ko said that older adults have typically had the highest suicide rates.  She pointed to physical illnesses and mental disorders, especially depression for this. Life stressors such as unemployment and the loss of loved ones are other contributory factors, she added.  She believes that keeping more elderly people employed could be a step in the right direction in improving the situation in Singapore. Dr Ko, who is also the executive director of Beyond Age, a consultancy that deals with ageing issues, said there are many benefits from employment.  “There’s the social aspect. And the elderly also feel a sense of usefulness, of contributing to the workplace and the society,” she said. While suicide is complex, employment is “certainly one way forward”, she said.  She added that the income they receive gives them a sense of independence. She acknowledged however that there are challenges, as employers are reluctant to hire older workers despite their wealth of experience. Dr Ko, who has 30 years of experience as a counsellor in the sector, added that there are other preventive steps to be taken before the elderly reach a depressive state. She highlighted active ageing programmes initiated by the Government and volunteer welfare organisations as positive steps, as they keep the elderly engaged, and their minds healthy. Such programmes give the elderly something to look forward to, she said. She gave an example of a Seniors Sports Day that was jointly organised by Singapore University of Social Sciences, St Luke’s ElderCare and SASCO Senior Citizens’ Home recently.  “I believe we need to have more such preventive programmes,” she said. While she lauded the many day care centres that have sprouted up, she cautioned that there are costs involved that not all can afford. MORE TRAINING TO SPOT THE SIGNS Dr Ko also suggested training more professionals like nurses, doctors and the police to pick up warning signs of elderly at risk of suicide. Assistant Director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation Wang Jing echoed the same view that more people should be trained. “Eldercare professionals like physicians, social workers and counsellors, especially, ought to make it a point to look out for signs of emotional wellness and distress and to screen and use standard assessment scales to identify risks so that action can be taken promptly,” she said. She added that as the Government is actively promoting befriending of older persons as a volunteer service, the volunteers could be given training to recognise indications of depression and suicide ideation. They should also be provided with protocols and channels for them to flag out persons-at-risk to their professional caregivers or other trained service staff at Family Service Centres and similar agencies, she said. Psychiatrist from Nobel Psychological Wellness Clinic Dr Seng Kok Han said that family physicians are a good starting point as most elderly with depression are seen by their family physicians. “However, geriatric depression is often under-recognized and undertreated, in part because they frequently have multiple medical disorders presenting as possible causes of patients’ symptoms, health care providers are often more focused on medical problems,” he said. Some of his patients who contemplated suicide include those whose children visited them only once a year, who suddenly found their lives without meaning after retirement, and who regretted neglecting their families previously and families now abandoning them.  MORE EDUCATION NEEDED ON DEPRESSION, SUICIDE SIGNS He also said that that the elderly who talk about suicide should not be taken lightly. “Studies have shown that people who committed suicide tend to have mentioned suicide to someone before,” Dr Seng said. Ms Wang said that one point to note within the family is that living under one roof is not enough - what makes the difference is making time to listen to and support one another.  \"Signs of low mood, self-neglect, stray statements on wanting to end their life can all point to deeper distress and should not be just dismissed and brushed aside,\" she said. There also needs to be more public education on depression, which is a major reason behind suicides, said Dr Seng, who was previously chief of the Department of Geriatric Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health. “Depression is not a normal aspect of ageing,” he said. Ms Wang shared the same sentiment about public education. “Through awareness and acceptance, there will be less stigma around feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts and a better chance of dealing with them before it’s too late,” she said. Ms Wang said that around 5 per cent of clients with Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching concern suicide ideation, a figure that has been fairly stable over the year. Interventions have been successful so far, she said. WHAT HAS HELPED IN SOME CASES Consultant in the Department of Geriatric Psychiatry at IMH Dr Richard Roshan Goveas gave examples of some early signs of elderly with suicidal thoughts. These could include changes in behaviour such as becoming increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, the direct or indirect expression of suicidal ideation or impulses including symptomatic acts such as giving away valued possessions, making a will and storing up medication, and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness in the family and social network. Someone has to watch over an elderly person who is highly suicidal or attempted suicide, Dr Goveas said. This is usually done in a hospital setting, he added. “The underlying mental illness like depression must be treated. When the mental state of the elderly patient improves, other agencies may need to be involved, depending on each case,” he said adding that the agencies may include family services centres, counselling service, day care or senior activity centres and befriending services. Elderly patients with suicidal thoughts have been helped with medications such as antidepressants, he said. In patients with chronic pain, better pain management helped. In patients who were socially isolated,  attending day care or senior activity centres helped. In patients with poor family relationships, referral to counsellors helped, he said.  Ms Wang said that in one instance, a client with uncontrolled diabetes, who was scheduled for a leg amputation and warned he could go blind, feared his independence would be so compromised that he wanted to end his life. However, the timely intervention of the Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching team, and the provision of practical aid in collaboration with other services helped to change his mind. He is coping well on his own with the help of a motorised mobility aid, she added. Dr Seng encouraged family members to recognize and acknowledge any fear or anxiety experienced by elderly family members facing depression. “Be sensitive. Do not make judgmental remarks or stressful demands such as expecting him or her ‘to simply snap out of it’,”he said.

These two boxers have gone on to become household names in the sport. Now it is Ridhwan's turn for a shot at glory. Ridhwan, 30, will take on Namibian former world champion Paulus Ambunda, 38, at the Marina Bay Sands on Sep 29 for the International Boxing Organisation (IBO) super bantamweight (up to 55kg) world title. But there's more than just a world title at stake. The IBO is considered the biggest organisation outside the sport's four major bodies: the World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Council and World Boxing Organisation (WBO). Pacquiao and Joshua won the IBO super lightweight and heavyweight world titles respectively before achieving greater heights, and Ridhwan acknowledged the significance of a victory next month. \"Our goal is to get bigger fights, tougher fights, whether locally or internationally,\" he told reporters at a media event on Wednesday (Aug 15). \"Maybe one day one of the big boys will call and say Scott, I want to fight one of your guys, Ridhwan,\" he added, referring to his manager and promoter Scott O'Farrell. \"And that’s the fight that we will want.\" However Ridhwan, who earned his title shot after beating Filipino Jeson Umbal for the IBO intercontinental featherweight title in April, said he is not getting carried away.  Ambunda is a formidable opponent who knows what it takes to win an IBO world title, having clinched the super bantamweight world title in August 2015 before losing it almost a year later. \"We are not undermining our opponent so we are still focused on this fight,\" Ridhwan added. TRASH TALK Still, there was no love lost between the fighters as they upped the ante ahead of their high-stakes bout. \"Scott, why are you making me punch an old man?\" Ridhwan asked, teasing Ambunda about his age. \"As a boxer, he's done. He's going to retire after this fight, he is going to thank me after that for helping him make a decision.  \"In terms of his boxing, he hits good but he's nothing great. He's slow because going forward, he's a walking punching bag.\" Ambunda, who's also a former WBO world bantamweight champion and Olympic quarter-finalist, didn't back down. \"I’m not yet old, I’m fresh and young. He’s my boy, and I’m his father. I will be his teacher on the 29th,\" he said. \"Ridhwan is a great boxer, up-and-coming, but he's still got a lot of mistakes in him. I have to teach him how to respect an elder in the ring. \"The fans of Ridhwan will break down in tears because they will see him counting stars.\" PREPARATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS On a more serious note, Ridhwan said his team will prepare for the fight by flying in a pair of sparring partners who are also world title contenders. His gameplan? Launching an offensive when Ambunda slows down and going for the knockout. \"I don't want Paulus to make excuses (after a potential defeat),\" Ridhwan said. Ridhwan doesn't want to make excuses for his career either, telling Channel NewsAsia afterwards that he wants to be \"the best professional boxer Singapore has ever seen\". Within the next five years, he said his target is to win a title from one of the big four boxing organisations. \"I don’t know if there will be a step up in weight, but I will definitely want to get one of those titles and bring it to Singapore,\" he said. \"With careful planning, hard work and dedication, I think we can reach that.\" O'Farrell said winning an IBO world title is the perfect launch pad into the big leagues, noting that the best boxers have usually held IBO world titles. \"It’s the only world title that has integrity,\" he explained, pointing out that the organisation aligns itself with BoxRec, one of the most recognised record-keeping systems in world boxing. \"BoxRec is a computerised system that tells you where a fighter is based on his fights and skill level and everything across all divisions. So, it’s kind of an unbiased view.\" To that end, O'Farrell said Ridhwan, who boasts an undefeated 11-0 record, has what it takes to reach the pinnacle of boxing. \"I've seen boxers before and this guy has every single bit,\" he said. \"You can see how strong he looks, you can see how sharp he looks. He’s also getting mentally ready, his game now is not all about physical and cardio, it’s very calculated.\" If Ridhwan wins his fight next month, O'Farrell said the plan is to defend the title and unify it with other major world titles. \"The long-term vision is to see Ridhwan as a four-time world champion with four different belts,\" he added. \"And then we’re gonna step him up through (weight) divisions.\" For Ridhwan, a three-time Southeast Asian Games bronze medallist, one of his biggest goals is to \"unite the whole of Singapore through boxing\". \"It will be amazing to see the whole arena packed with a lot of Singaporeans,\" he added. \"Maybe they can bring back the Kallang Wave, but in a boxing arena.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/boxing-singaporean-muhamad-ridhwan-ibo-world-title-big-leagues-10618636"}, {"datetime": "16 Aug 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["freelancers", "coaches", "instructors", "manpower"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "'At the brunt of this for many years': Freelance coaches want level playing field for job search", "content": " SINGAPORE: Freelance netball coach Justin Teh once had to suffer the loss of his income because he was unable to coach during the SARS viral outbreak in 2003. It left him out of work for about two months which amounted to about S$3,000 forgone at the start of his 17-year freelancing career. “There was a blanket stoppage of co-curricular activities (CCAs) in schools and it was almost my full income because I came out to explore coaching as a career,” he said. After the incident, Mr Teh asked around for advice to buy an insurance policy to mitigate temporary losses of income but found it impossible. “If you were to buy as an individual, it’ll cost an arm and a leg. Also, individually it’s very hard to bargain,” Mr Teh said. The same difficulty is also encountered by other freelancers, such as instructors and music educators who work with schools and communities. To address these woes, NTUC announced that it is planning to set up the National Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA) by the end of the year to support the welfare of coaches and instructors, estimated to be some 5,000 full-time freelancers. Lye Yen Kai, president of Outdoor Learning and Adventure Education (OLAE) Association, said that there are currently more freelancers than full-time staff in his industry as outdoor programmes are seasonal. While introducing a prolonged medical leave insurance deal is a “good move”, it would be better with NTUC if it can further subsidise the insurance package for outdoor practitioners as they are not paid as much as sports coaches, he said. “Some of our freelancers are between 18 and 21 years old, which means this group of freelancers may not even have the financial capacity to pay or even see the need to be part of this group,” Mr Lye said. “We also hope that the criteria of claiming loss of income will not be a tedious process,” he said. Apart from the temporary loss of income, freelancers Channel NewsAsia spoke to said they are concerned about friendlier job procurement practices and building the capabilities of the industry.  JOB PROCUREMENT SYSTEM PUTS FREELANCERS AT RISK Freelance band conductor Adrian Chiang, who has been teaching school bands for 19 years, said that the government job procurement system has made it challenging for freelancers, especially those who work with schools. Mr Chiang, who is also the president of Band Directors’ Association Singapore (BDAS), said that the industry is completely staffed by freelancers. These include choir instructors, band directors, and Chinese orchestra conductors. In order to get work with a school, freelancers have to submit a quotation for their services when the Ministry of Education publishes an Invitation to Quote (ITQ) as a service buyer. The challenging part about this process, Mr Chiang said, is that ITQs are usually released on a yearly basis based on the academic calendar year. Instructors are contracted for a year’s work which runs from January to December but this may be extended to two years. The bidding period for ITQs typically happen sometime in October, he told Channel NewsAsia. Instructors may bid and lose, and not have the opportunity to bid for other instruction projects at other schools because the bidding period has already closed. “Many of us are at the brunt of this for many years. Come January if all the jobs are filled up, what am I going to do? If you miss that window, you’re done for the year,” Mr Chiang said. “CCA instructors are also very important in the development of a child, like a teacher in school. We see them potentially from Secondary One to Secondary Four for four years so it’s hard for us when we have to bid annually for a project,” he said. Freelance choir conductor Cherie Chai said that with the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) competition, students may stand to benefit from having the same conductors to practice during the run-up to SYF. With a change in the conductor, there may not be continuity and consistency for the students, she said. “To your own conscience, you know that you have been doing your best of your abilities and there is no reason why the school would not want to extend the contract,” Ms Chai said. \"But always that slight fear that someone is going to underbid you significantly enough that you would not be able to extend your contract,” Ms Chai added. Mr Teh echoed similar sentiments. Sports coaches also have to comply with the same job procurement practices and are asked to submit bids for a year’s work. “Usually the ITQ will come out … and once it closes, there will be a period of evaluation by the school and the award will come out. All in all, from preparing the ITQ to closing and the awarding can take one to two months. It varies,” Mr Teh said. “Let’s say if the contract ends in December, perhaps the ITQs can come out in August. When we bid for it and don’t get it and we know by September, we can look for something else,” he added. To cope with job uncertainty, both Mr Chiang and Mr Teh said that they have seen colleagues who have taken up multiple part-time jobs that offer flexible work arrangements in order to accommodate their primary job as an instructor. Some of these instructors have become real estate agents, insurance agents, and private hire drivers. Both hope the NICA will be able to negotiate friendlier procurement policies for freelancers by providing multiple bidding periods and introducing firing notice periods. “In a typical hiring and firing situation, you’ll at least give people a good two to three months’ notice. If you know you’re not going to continue with the instructor, they can go and apply for other jobs,” Mr Chiang said. RAISING THE PROFILE OF THE WORK Fitness consultant Kelvin Chua said the association can help provide clearer career pathways and help freelancers with financial planning. One issue, in particular, is the stagnating wages of freelance fitness coaches because of a lack in recognition of their skills and certifications. Mr Chua said that even if fitness instructors go in with more than a basic level of knowledge, their income does not commensurate because service buyers are not aware of the qualifications in the market. “With the association, perhaps we can set the benchmark, standards, and recommendations to say that these instructors with certain qualifications should be paid at a certain rate,” Mr Chua said. “Then in terms of career planning, you should have a development plan for your career. Even though you’re a freelancer, you should have a career pathway,” Mr Chua added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/freelance-coaches-schools-job-search-level-playing-field-10618988"}, {"datetime": "15 Aug 2018 09:09PM", "tags": ["Italy", "Genoa", "accident"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore leaders send condolences over Genoa bridge collapse", "content": " SINGAPORE: President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong have written to their respective Italian counterparts to express their condolences over the collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa.

That appears to be possible with more companies tapping a government scheme to develop and promote healthier products - including mooncakes for the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival. The Healthier Development Ingredient Scheme, which supports manufacturers in developing and promoting healthier ingredients such as wholegrain noodles, was recently expanded to include lower-sugar items such as desserts, sauces and beverages. Since the scheme was announced last year, 21 companies have applied for the grant, some more than once, said the Health Promotion Board (HPB) in an update on Wednesday (Aug 15). A total of S$7 million has been disbursed for 26 grant applications, according to HPB CEO Zee Yoong Kang. This is a fifth of the S$35 million in funding to be disbursed over three years. More than 3,000 food and beverage outlets across Singapore now use healthier products such as wholegrain noodles. But Mr Zee said more can be done to persuade more manufacturers and food operators to come on board. \"By coming into the healthier foods trend, you're actually going to increase your sales because people out there want these options. Once we get that message through, more people will join. I'm convinced of that,\" said Mr Zee. Tung Lok Group, one of the larger mooncake suppliers in the market, has tapped the scheme to modify the lotus paste in their mooncakes. They said they have to keep up with consumer demand as people become more health conscious. One mooncake used to contain 10 teaspoons of regular sugar. Tung Lok has managed to reduce the amount of sugar to seven teaspoons without sacrificing taste by blending regular sugar with allulose, a type of sugar found in fruit. Allulose has the same taste and texture as regular sugar but it contains fewer calories and does not cause insulin levels to spike as it has a lower glycemic index. To demonstrate their commitment to the cause, the company will only be selling healthier lotus paste mooncakes from now on, it said. \"If you have a mooncake which is lower in sugar, lower in calories, lower in saturated fat, higher in dietary fibre and higher in flavour, this is an ideal mooncake so it should sell better,\" said Tung Lok CEO Andrew Tjioe. Another company that acknowledges the shifting trend is Kwong Seng International. The small- and medium-size enterprise, which will be applying for the grant, said creating healthier products is not just about improving the company’s bottom line but a matter of survival. “If you do not keep up with the trends where people are moving towards healthier products, people will not buy your traditional products - people will buy the healthier product. You'll be kicked out of the market,\" said the company's managing director, Mr Lawrence Sew. His company started developing a mee siam sauce with less sugar a year ago. It has already secured a buyer, homegrown food chain Ya Kun, that will use their sauce. Kwong Seng International hopes to use the grant to defray the cost of marketing the sauce in Singapore and at trade fairs overseas, it said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-companies-tapping-government-scheme-to-develop-healthy-food-10619952"}, {"datetime": "15 Aug 2018 06:16PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Man who opened car door, causing death of motorcyclist, jailed two weeks", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 36-year-old man who opened a car door, causing a motorcyclist to crash to the ground in a fatal accident, was jailed for two weeks on Wednesday (Aug 15). The 27-year-old Malaysian motorcyclist sustained serious facial injuries because of the accident and died in hospital on the same day. At about 9.30pm on Feb 22 last year, Eswaran Balakrishnan was in the front passenger seat of a car that had stopped at a red light along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, towards Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. The car was driven by his girlfriend, the court heard. As Eswaran was having an argument with his girlfriend, he wanted to alight from the car, his defence lawyer said. He opened the door once and closed it. The car was in the fourth lane of a six-lane road, while the victim was riding his motorcycle in between the fourth and the fifth lanes, on the left side of the car. When the motorcycle was parallel to the left side of the car, Eswaran opened the door a second time, hitting the motorcycle. The bike was pushed forward, falling to its side and skidding, while the victim fell to the ground. A forensic pathologist certified the cause of death as head injuries consistent with a road traffic accident. Deputy Public Prosecutor Soh Weiqi asked for a sentence of at least three weeks' jail, saying that the accused should have checked for traffic before opening the door.  She said that the traffic light had turned green and the accused should have expected that there would be vehicles, calling his actions \"rash\" and \"reckless\". Defence lawyer Peter Keith Fernando asked the court to impose \"a relatively stiff fine\" on Eswaran instead, saying that he was \"a man of no prior convictions\". District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt agreed that Eswaran had performed a dangerous act. \"It's not even the side of the road, it's lane four of a six-lane road,\" he said. \"I know this road, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, it's a very busy road.\" He took into account Eswaran's plea of guilt and sentenced him to two weeks' jail for one charge of causing death by a negligent act. He allowed a deferment of the sentence to next month, as two of Eswaran's family members had died recently.

Mr Leon Chen, country manager for Singapore and Indonesia at Alibaba Cloud, told Channel NewsAsia on the sidelines of the Alibaba Cloud Summit 2018 held here on Wednesday (Aug 15) that the demo centre is “planned for September”, and more details will be disclosed nearer the date. Another Alibaba Cloud executive, Dr Derek Wang, said in a separate interview on Wednesday that the demo centre will be used to showcase its cloud computing capabilities currently being used in its Hema supermarkets in China, as well as other partners like Australian online fashion store The Iconic.  The Iconic uses Alibaba’s image search functionality to power its Snap to Search feature, allowing consumers to take a picture of an item of clothing and then search and purchase that product via its app.  “Talk is cheap,” said Dr Wang, who is the chief solution architect at Alibaba Cloud International. The demo centre makes it easier for prospective customers to get a first-hand experience of how the different technologies would work, he explained. There are currently more than 1 million paying customers on Alibaba’s cloud platform globally, but the company is not able to provide the breakdown of customers in Singapore.  He gave a slightly longer runway for the centre’s opening than Mr Chen though, saying it should be ready by “end of the year”.  COMPETING WITH THE INCUMBENTS Opening the event on Wednesday was Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who is also the Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation Initiative.  In his opening keynote, Dr Balakrishnan noted that Alibaba Cloud is actually “a bit late to the game”. The cloud unit was formed in 2009 but only made its first foray out of China when it set up its international headquarters in Singapore in 2015.  This point has not been lost on the Chinese cloud player.  President of Alibaba Cloud Simon Hu had in a 2015 Reuters article said the unit’s goal is to “overtake Amazon in four years, whether that’s in customers, technology or worldwide scale”.  Asked if there’s an update on the timeframe of that goal, Dr Wang said the gap between them and the other market players like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft’s cloud services “is being narrowed”. He pointed to four differentiators the company have compared with what is out in the market today, with the first being it has the most data centres in Asia Pacific. It has data centres in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and India, according to the company's website. By comparison, Google has data centre presence in markets like India, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and Australia while AWS has such facilities in India, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, Japan and China.  Dr Wang also pointed out that Alibaba Cloud is “deeply localised”, and one example of this is its commitment to building up research teams in individual markets with academia.  On Wednesday, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the National University of Singapore (NUS) to allow the latter’s business analytics students to participate in internships at the company and gain knowledge in areas like big data, cloud computing, business analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It will also offer an education certification programme to students from the NUS Master of Science in Business Analytics programme. It had earlier signed up the Nanyang Technological University and the Singapore University of Social Sciences as partners.  The third point of differentiation is in the products they are offering.  At the summit, Alibaba Cloud launched nine products globally, including in areas like Internet of Things, data analytics and the Anti-Bot Service. The latter helps companies like AirAsia or online travel booking firms tackle the issue of online scalpers and digital “squatters” who reserve airline tickets or hotel rooms and preventing actual customers from transacting. This is a tool to address a specific industry pain point, and not provided by other cloud vendors, Dr Wang said. Lastly, the executive pointed to its “Go China” strategy, which essentially dangles to prospective customers looking to enter the China market the capabilities and tools that Alibaba has, such as logistics and payment services like Alipay. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/pay-with-your-face-alibaba-plans-to-showcase-innovative-retail-10619486"}, {"datetime": "15 Aug 2018 05:46PM", "tags": ["theft", "housebreaking", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "53-year-old suspect arrested for housebreaking and theft along Faber Park", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 53-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday (Aug 15) for his suspected involvement in a case of housebreaking and theft by night along Faber Park.

He made those remarks during his keynote speech at an event organised by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) for SMEs on Wednesday (Aug 15). \"By working together, it doesn't mean we don't compete. There are many areas that we have common problems, and for common problems, we should come together for a common solution,\" said Mr Heng.  “In that regard, the Government is very happy to work together with you to solve these common problems.\" Mr Heng said that Singapore businesses need to foster a spirit of collaboration among three key groups, namely the universities, industry and the Government, to form a \"Triangle of Innovation\". On that basis, he added: \"Technology we have must be used by our companies.\" An example of a government effort is the Group-Based Upgrading (GBU) initiative by Enterprise Singapore which was launched last year.  The initiative encourages SMEs to adopt group-based solutions when tackling common business challenges. According to SCCCI’s 2018 business survey, 67 per cent of SMEs have benefited from government assistance schemes. When asked by Channel NewsAsia how the SCCCI will play a role in getting companies to collaborate, SCCCI president Roland Ng cited the organisation's digitalisation plan which aims to help companies \"share information on the common problems\" in bringing their businesses digital. In the same survey, SMEs said key challenges faced by them were rising business costs, manpower shortage and stiff competition in the local market. \"In this (business) climate I think the chambers has to help do a lot of things, we have to help gather a lot of SMEs and help them digitise their companies in their different phases,\" said Mr Ng. “At the same time, we also want to help them find new markets, especially in Southeast Asia.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/smes-should-collaborate-in-the-face-of-disruption-heng-swee-keat-10618774"}, {"datetime": "15 Aug 2018 02:33PM", "tags": ["Trending", "Concerts"], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "Pop-opera group Il Divo to perform in Singapore in October", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos  SINGAPORE: Pop-opera group Il Divo will be returning to Singapore on Oct 13 this year.

Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), developers sold 1,724 units in July, compared with 1,112 units in the same month a year earlier, Urban Redevelopment Authority data showed. July's sales were the highest since March 2017 when 1,780 units were sold. Compared to the previous month, transactions were more than double June's 654 units. Including ECs, 1,776 units were sold in July, a large jump from the 706 sold the previous month, but a drop from the 2,092 homes sold in July last year.  PANIC BUYING The July jump came after the Government introduced additional property cooling measures in the first week of the month, including raising Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty rates and tightening loan-to-value limits on residential property purchases.  Showrooms extended their opening hours and several developers brought forward their launches, as scores of potential buyers flooded showflats on Jul 5 in the hopes of locking in a last-minute buy before the new rules kicked in the following day. Developers launched a 2,239 new units in July – the highest since March 2013 when 3,489 new private homes were placed on the market, noted Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore, Colliers International. PropNex Realty CEO Ismail Gafoor said that July's data was \"expected due to buyers and property investors rushing to purchase their units before the implementation of the recent cooling measures\". \"As reported, about 1,000 units were sold at top performing projects Riverfront Residences, Park Colonial and Stirling Residences in just one night,\" said Mr Ismail. MAINTAINING MARKET SENTIMENT In the weeks since the new housing curbs were implemented, however, market sentiment still seems to be relatively healthy, analysts said. \"What is notable is that post-cooling measures, the sales momentum carried through at these three projects and other developments as well, as reflected by the total units sold (1,724 units) in July,\" said Mr Ismail. \"This can be attributed to the developers adjusting their prices, enticing buyers to commit to their purchase,\" he added. Colliers' Ms Song also pointed out that buyers purchased an additional 118, 119 and 139 units at Riverfront Residences, Park Colonial and Stirling Residences respectively after the cooling measures took effect.  \"We believe this reflected genuine demand, undeterred by the higher additional buyer’s stamp duty and lowered loan-to-value limits,\" Ms Song said. In all, more than 38.4 per cent of the URA caveats lodged in July were done post-measures, noted OrangeTee.  \"The high percentage of caveats lodged after the implementation of the cooling measures indicate that sales are still relatively quite healthy, driven mostly by first-timers who are less affected by the cooling measures and found the current launch prices quite attractive,\" said Ms Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee.  Moving forward, sales are expected to moderate from the high-base of July's sales. \"Moderated monthly sales figures are likely to be seen for the rest of the year, taking into account the more cautious mood of both buyers and sellers,” said JLL national director of research and consultancy Ong Teck Hui. However, Mr Ong added, realistically priced projects will likely achieve a better take-up. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/july-s-new-home-sales-soar-55-to-16-month-high-on-panic-buying-10618498"}, {"datetime": "15 Aug 2018 12:56PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Teenager pleads guilty to sexual acts with underage boy from children's home", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 17-year-old boy on Wednesday (Aug 15) pleaded guilty to performing sexual acts on an underage boy who lived in the same children's home as he did. Both boys cannot be named due to gag orders. The name of the children's home was redacted from court documents. The head of the social work department at the home informed the police on Oct 10, 2016 that he had discovered the two boys having sex. Court documents showed that the two boys were in the living room at the children's home on Oct 9, where they discussed previous relationships they had with other male friends. The accused, who was then 16, then proceeded to molest and perform a sexual act on the victim, who was then 14. The next morning, the victim - accompanied by the accused - left for school. The pair took a bus to Serangoon bus interchange under NEX mall, court documents said. There, the older boy led the younger one to a toilet in the mall. They both entered the same cubicle. The accused performed a sexual act on the victim, before asking him to have sex. The 17-year-old teenager has admitted to two charges of sexual penetration of a minor, with a third charge to be taken into consideration for sentencing.

With her husband's salary not being \"high enough\", and to support her three children, she decided to stop being a housewife, and turned to a job she was familiar with, having once done it in China. To her family, Coco (not her real name), 43, has been the boss of her own small, one-woman massage parlour for five years. What they don’t know is that “since day one”, she has been offering extra sexual services along with back rubs and foot kneads. “I’m doing it for my husband and children, just using different methods to make money,” she said in Mandarin. “For now we are happy and everything is alright. But if the police catch me, it’ll surely lead to divorce.” Of late, Coco has had more to fear. New laws against unlicensed massage joints were passed in November last year under the Massage Establishment Act (MEA) and came into force in March. Under the toughened laws, offending operators face up to S$10,000 in fines - 10 times the previous penalty - or two years in jail. These efforts represent an attempt to clean up what appears to be an ongoing issue in Singapore. Most recently available figures show the number of illegal massage parlours increasing by 40 per cent from 2013 to 2016. Of the 300-odd errant operators identified in 2016, 40 per cent were engaged in vice-related offences. While debating the bill in Parliament last year, Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo gave further context to the new legislation, stating the previous S$1,000 penalty as “grossly insufficient” compared to the profits that unlicensed establishments can make “especially by engaging in vice activities”. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) told Channel NewsAsia that due to operational considerations, it could not comment on the number of raids conducted since the implementation of the new MEA. But it promised to “continue to take strong enforcement actions against unlicensed massage establishments, as well as errant licensed massage establishments”. This year, the police have taken to issuing a monthly average of around four announcements of arrests stemming from raids on such establishments, compared to the second half of 2017, when there was one or fewer such announcements per month on average. Vanessa Ho, who heads local sex worker rights group Project X, said that just by walking the ground, she had observed an increase in the number of targeted raids on massage parlours. “THEY DON’T BUG US” - OR DO THEY? In the Jalan Besar and Beach Road areas, which have been the subject of repeated police raids, residents have expressed concern to their Member of Parliament (MP) Ms Denise Phua over a perceived increase in the number of massage parlours and related vice activities. Ms Phua said she had conveyed such feedback to the police.  “My residents welcome police efforts to clamp down unlicensed operators and vice activities in their neighbourhoods, for the sake of their loved ones,” she added. It is the police’s duty, she said, “to ensure a safe and secure living environment for residents and other businesses”. Her fellow MP Heng Chee How, whose ward includes nearby Lavender Street, faces similar issues.  “On behalf of the residents of Whampoa ward, we have maintained a clear and consistent position with the police - that we support strict enforcement against all illegal and vice activities in our area,” he said. Along Lavender Street, which is in Mr Heng's ward, there are at least four recently-shuttered massage establishments. With signage still intact, they stand directly in front of the Bendemeer Light estate. A resident of four years there, Teresa, 38, has seen plenty of skimpily-dressed women openly walking around and hanging their clothes out to dry. “It’s obvious that something’s up, but they don’t bug us,” she said. One of her neighbours, a woman who declined to be named, said: “I just stay away from that area. Then you won’t notice anything.” For more than 20 years now, Mr and Mrs Ong have run an auto accessories shop directly opposite the stretch of massage parlours. “Last time, it was 10 shops in a row,” said Mr Ong. “They come and go, but the scantily clad women are always around.” On nearby Cavan Road, raided by police just last month, a lone massage establishment can be found - and seemingly closed for good, with its interior left in disarray as seen through the glass door. Neighbouring businesses said it appeared to be operated independently by a woman from China, who did not interact much save for the occasional hello and good-bye. “It’s quiet around here, the only thing is she liked to hang underwear outside,” said the owner of a nearby shop. “But it’s alright - as we Singaporeans like to say, don’t come and disturb can already.” CLAMPDOWN “COMPLETELY USELESS”? Meanwhile Coco, whose parlour has previously been raided, said the new laws are “too strict”. “It’s not like we want to do bad things. I don’t feel like I’m doing anything wrong. Inside our shops, we’re not affecting anyone, not harming anyone - so why do you have to jail people?” she asked.  “They are being unreasonable. Just issue everyone licences. If during checks they’re really found to have done wrong, then take away the licence and they’ll stop.” But while ongoing attempts to shut down the illegal businesses are creating nervousness among their owners, eradicating the problem once and for all may be a challenge. Ho explained that with each raid, foreign workers lacking proper documentation will be deported and blacklisted from coming back. “But new batches of women enter the country to take their place,” Ho said. “The cycle continues. Agents and pimps benefit the most because they earn new batches of agent fees. “Clients can also be said to ‘benefit’ as after the women are arrested, new women show up to take their place. And the clients return for more.” She added: “With the MEA, current efforts may succeed in eradicating most sex work from massage parlours. But what's next? Where will they be displaced to? And for how long more can we play this cat and mouse game?” Coco agreed. “Close down one, and they’ll just open more and more parlours somewhere else,” she declared.  “Whether from Thailand, Vietnam or elsewhere, there will always be supply. All these operations are completely useless. You can’t finish catching them all.” “WE JUST WANT A RICE BOWL” Local massage parlour owner Sonia (also not her real name), 55, blamed the stiffer laws on these foreigners. “That’s why at my place, all the girls are Singaporean, and we all just want a rice bowl,” she added. “If we don’t do this, somebody’s mother, sister or daughter will be in this line anyway.” A single mother, Sonia turned to the massage industry 20 years ago. “I needed cash then for my son who got cancer,” she said. “Now, all he knows is that mum has a shop.” She said that her employees offer \"basic\" sexual services of their own accord. “It’s their own arrangement with the customers. We owners don’t force the girls to do anything,” said Sonia. “They want the money. My girls, some of them have old mothers, or up to four kids who’re schooling, and they need to pay fees.” Coco, too, said she did not want \"to keep doing this\". \"I hope to stop in three years. But for now, I need the money,” she added. Sonia said her masseuses receive a base monthly pay of S$500, and could get up to S$50 for a sexual service. Each of them gets one to two customers a night. The parlour is open daily. “I’ve had my girls’ husbands come to my shop, asking them what the hell are they doing, then of course they get separated,” she said.  “But if you ask my girls to go find another job, they’ll go be cleaners and they won’t earn enough.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/unlicensed-massage-parlours-establishments-act-illegal-vice-10616390"}, {"datetime": "15 Aug 2018 06:20AM", "tags": ["internship", "productivity", "work-life", "employment"], "author": "Adrian Tan", "title": "Commentary: Not the end of the world, when you get a ‘lousy internship’ with mindless tasks", "content": " SINGAPORE: John is doing a six-month internship at a global biomedical company. As an undergraduate pursuing a science degree, he expects to gain relevant hands-on experience to supplement what he learnt back in university.  This would include checking for possible harmful interactions among different drugs patients take, getting practice in record-keeping duties, and helping patients secure the claims they deserve through liaising with insurance companies. If he is fortunate, he might even learn to administer some medications and perform basic tests, like taking a patient’s blood pressure. But alas, he will continue to reminisce about such hopes and dreams, as he continues with his assigned tasks this morning - wrapping presents for the company’s guests of honour for next week’s event. MINDLESS WORK John is not the first and won’t be the last intern to be doing such mindless work. Buying coffee, queuing up to place the latest World Cup bets for his boss or stuffing Chinese New Year cards into envelopes. It doesn’t matter if one is a 3rd lower and 1st upper, because these tasks don’t discriminate. These menial duties might not cross the line into misconduct or abuse but they are nonetheless meaningless and do not contribute to the professional development of interns like John. As an employer responsible for hiring and overseeing interns in the past, I can understand why such things happen.  No, there wasn’t any inappropriate conduct on my part nor did I become a violent slapping machine when the interns at our company irked me. But many of our interns spent their final week decorating our office Christmas tree, a job their diplomas in HR didn’t equip them with skills for or require from them. Why did I do that? From a resource allocation perspective, it actually makes perfect sense. You wouldn’t otherwise get your top salesperson to spend time hanging up ornaments. The challenge for most company leaders is to strike a balance. Even for non-interns, employees often get tasked (read: Arrowed) to take on responsibilities not mentioned anywhere in the job description. Dinner and dance committee anyone? But from a big picture perspective, these tasks probably take up at most 3 per cent of a year’s worth of work time. The same quantum should be acceptable for an intern. The problem arises when an intern starts to spend more time getting coffee for others instead of putting their academic theories to practice - unless you are a barrister intern. BE ALERT I believe much of whether an internships are likely to be useful depends on the duration of the internship and if you noticed, the reputation or size of the company. With so much public relations at stake, a giant like DBS bank, for instance, will never allow such bad press. Conversely, the ones covered in the news for questionable internship practices could easily close down, reopen and their neighbours would barely notice. Internships has undergone extension over recent years - under programmes between educational institutes of higher learning and the industry, like the Skillsfuture Enhanced Internships, which integrate internships as part of the core curriculum.  The aim is to equip students with a longer stint of real-world experience in the hope that it would make them better prepared for the jobs they will take on when they enter the workforce. With a longer period of commitment, I believe employers will also have more runway to train up and make more productive use of their interns. And that includes a good induction programme so they can operate solo instead of being hand-held every single minute. Interns on the other hand also have to be vigilant and be on the lookout for signs of possible abuse. Just like how we are educated to ignore private calls claiming to be your missing DHL parcel and requesting for your credit card details to send this back to you, schools too need to sharpen their students’ common sense. Hiring managers should also be screened and interviewed thoroughly by the schools and interns to ensure a good fit. The same level of due diligence should apply vis-a-vis securing full-time employment. If all that is logistically impossible, go with big company names as a safeguard. GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT  From my decade of experience in recruitment and career coaching, having a meaningful, impactful internship is very important in giving individuals a competitive edge. If you have industry-relevant internship experience, it will help you stand out from the crowd of coursemates who will be leaving school with the same certificate.  Grades may help but a demonstrated ability to do the job is more important to employers. Like what Alibaba founder Jack Ma said, companies aim to hire the right talent, not the best one with the finest paper credentials. If you are already stuck in a lousy internship, my heart goes out to you but it isn’t the end of the world.  After all, internships are about buffering yourself with practical skills to supplement your formal education and you should strive to see where else in the company you can add value.  You can also score experience points by temping or putting yourself up for gigs on freelancer platforms. And it doesn’t even have to be paid. A jobseeker I know was making a transition from engineering to data analytics. While his old classmates and peers looking for a similar career switch were waiting around for employment calls to come, he volunteered for a free internship with an IT company and did six months of pro bono work. It may not seem much but his practical experience aided him in passing the assessment test of another company when they were on the lookout for a data engineer trainee. Today, he is gainfully employed while cobwebs are forming over his former classmates. LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH CHALLENGES At the end of the day, whether the internship goes well or turns bad, it is really okay.  Real life in the working world is going to be just like that - with unexpected twists and unforeseen work demands - and the earlier you get used to it and figure out how best to deal with these challenges, the better. Just ensure you reflect and learn from it. Many people learnt and grew to become better despite lousy bosses or horrible parents. You can also learn from a bad internship.

He elaborated that the key to this is convincing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that going digital is a valuable undertaking. In an exclusive interview with Channel NewsAsia, Mr Iswaran said that efforts to scale up digitalisation across the island are ongoing, including plans to create more digitally-enabled neighbourhoods such as Chinatown, Little India and \"one to two heartland shopping areas\". This follows Kampong Glam, which began cashless payments, augmented reality navigation and virtual in-store tours earlier this year, with an estimated 150 merchants set to benefit. \"This way, you’re taking digitalisation initiatives to locales not quite in the mainstream of digitalisation,\" said Mr Iswaran.  \"It enhances the customer experience, the precinct as a provider of services, and it will improve business opportunities for the businesses operating there.\" BUILDING A DIGITAL FUTURE Mr Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, said the ultimate objective is to build a \"thriving future for Singapore in the digital era\", where everyone can actively participate in this enterprise.  Since taking on the Communications and Information portfolio in May, various initiatives to give both businesses and individuals a leg-up have been unveiled. This includes the ramping up of the SMEs Go Digital programme to develop targeted industry digital plans and the TechSkills Accelerator efforts to equip people with relevant skills. So far, more than 1,000 SMEs have benefited from the initiative, while a total of 39,000 training places have been taken or committed by companies since its launch. But convincing businesses of the benefits of going digital remains a key challenge.  \"It's by no means unique to Singapore - I've seen this in Germany, France and various parts of the world, where you'd expect to be quite advanced in technological adoption, but they also have the same challenges,\" said Mr Iswaran. \"You first need industry and business leaders to come to the conclusion that this is the right thing to do, and that this will indeed make a difference to their business. And therefore, the investment you make will be worthwhile and yield the returns you want.\" There is also \"ample help\" to guide SMEs in implementing digital solutions in both the public and private sectors, he added. SINGAPORE SHOULD NOT BE DETERRED BY CYBER THREATS: ISWARAN While digitalisation can reap benefits for the country, emerging cyberthreats such as deliberate online falsehoods and cyberattacks will remain, such as the SingHealth data breach in July, when records of 1.5 million people were stolen. Even so, this should not dampen digitalisation efforts, noted Mr Iswaran, who is also the minister responsible for cybersecurity. \"Even as we work to deal with and get to the bottom of it, and ensure our systems emerge stronger by implementing appropriate measures ... the broader message to Singaporeans (is) that this sort of cybersecurity threat is going to be part and parcel of the digital future,\" said Mr Iswaran. He added that such incidents should not \"cow or deter us from pursuing this path, because it is a path that’s going to create the opportunities for this and future generations of Singaporeans\". While measures can and will be taken to strengthen its IT systems, Mr Iswaran said Singapore can never be foolproof.  \"We have to be prepared that a scenario like this may occur, and what that preparation entails is, on one hand, doing everything we can to prevent it from happening. \"But if it were to occur, to respond effectively and to be resilient and emerge stronger is the mindset we need when dealing with this issue.\" NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY Mr Iswaran said he remains confident that Singapore is well-placed to realise its vision of a Smart Nation, because it has set a national direction and won the trust of both domestic and international audiences - but there is no room for complacency. \"We must recognise that other cities and nations around the world are also embarking on this effort. And so this also becomes a competitive advantage - we're competing for investments,\" he said. \"The most important thing we can do is first to state categorically that the Government takes with utmost seriousness the security of our IT systems and databases, and we are investing considerable resource and efforts to ensure they remain secure.\" While he acknowledged that confidence may have been shaken following the health data breach, the government's transparent and resolution response - by setting out what happened and listing measures that have been taken - was key to maintaining trust. \"I think this is an important way to give Singaporeans the assurance and uphold their trust and confidence in our systems. That’s the best way of dealing with it,\" he said.  \"We’ve also been transparent to spell out very clearly what has happened, what data has and has not been compromised, so the full extent of this incident is made very clear to Singaporeans as well.\" Singaporeans must also play their part, such as by exercising good cyber hygiene habits like setting strong passwords, and not falling for rumours and falsehoods circulating online, said Mr Iswaran. \"At the need of the day, we need our people to be educated and discerning - that is the ultimate firewall.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-iswaran-singapore-smart-nation-vision-cybersecurity-mci-10616858"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 08:03PM", "tags": ["Chan Chun Sing", "trade", "business", "United States"], "author": "Eugenia Lim", "title": "American businesses  have 'tremendous responsibility' in shaping US trade policies: Chan Chun Sing", "content": " SINGAPORE: US businesses have a responsibility in shaping Washington's trade policies, said Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (Aug 14) at an event organised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham).  Speaking to about 250 members of the American and international business community, Mr Chan said: “You have tremendous responsibility because you are the movers and shakers of businesses in Southeast Asia, if not in the Asia-Pacific region. “You have tremendous responsibility because you are the movers and shakers of businesses in Southeast Asia, if not in the Asia-Pacific region.\" His comments come amid an ongoing trade row between the United States and China. While there are differences between the two, Mr Chan said there are greater interdependencies. “Today we are not in the era of the Cold War; we should not have this zero-sum mentality of us versus them,” he said. If the US and China are not able to agree to terms bilaterally, then at least they should do so multilaterally, the minister added. “Often it is difficult to work out bilateral agreements - sometimes multilateral agreements are useful because it helps to balance out the pluses and minuses on a wider platform,” said Mr Chan. In response to a question on how the trade conflict, if prolonged, might impact Singapore, Mr Chan said Singapore will continue to work with like-minded parties for a rules-based system.

In addition, Singapore will work to upgrade its capabilities to compete on speed of innovation and quality of ideas, said Mr Chan.

When asked about what Singapore’s Government thought about the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy, Mr Chan said that it made perfect sense as the US is present in Northeast Asia and Southwest Asia. “If you look at the global geopolitical chessboard, the way to connect Northeast Asia and Southwest Asia is Southeast Asia.

In 2017, 14,000 people received subsidised home and centre-based care compared to 10,000 seniors who are cared for in nursing homes, said the Lien Foundation study, citing figures from the Ministry of Health (MOH). But these services do not come cheap. It is more expensive for a family to look after a severely disabled senior at home than admitting them to a nursing home run by a volunteer welfare organisation (VWO), according to the study which was released on Tuesday (Aug 14). A family looking after a severely disabled senior at home could pay up to S$3,100 per month, including transport and consumables before subsidies. This is higher than the median full cost of S$2,400 for looking after the same person in a VWO-run nursing home. The cost for centre-based care is between S$900 and S$2,200 per month, according to the report which was co-authored by National University of Singapore academics Associate Professors Elaine Ho and Shirlena Huang. “Even as Singapore works to enable seniors to remain healthy, active and engaged for as long as the can, it must be mindful that more will need care and that quality long-term care can be expensive,” said Ms Radha Basu, director for research and advocacy at Lien Foundation which commissioned the study to shed light on the state of formal centre-based and home-based care for seniors in Singapore. Although two-thirds of all households now qualify for means-tested subsidies, the study found that co-payment is a key concern, as they would still be paying between 20 per cent and 70 per cent of the cost even after subsidies, the report found. Costs may even deter middle-income families from using formal long-term care services, especially since many find it cheaper to hire a domestic worker instead, Assoc Prof Ho said.  However, maids may not be trained enough to handle complex care needs and sometimes, could end up compromising the well-being and health of vulnerable seniors, according to the study. Other than financing of long-term care, the study also looked at the demand and supply of services, human resource capabilities, care quality and governance. CAPACITY AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING Despite the demand for such care services, and a ramping up of home and centre-based places in Singapore from 5,900 in 2011 to 13,000 last year, capacity for certain services may not be enough, the study found. In 2015 for example, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which coordinates Singapore's long-term care services, received 7,800 referrals for day care services, more than double the 3,500 day care places that were available that year. The number of places increased to 5,000 in 2017, but this still fell short. \"The need has likely increased since then,\" said Lien Foundation and the academics. Despite a substantial rise in long-term care spending by MOH in recent years, the spending amounted to only 8 per cent of the healthcare budget and 0.19 per cent of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product for the year, the report added. Long-term care spending was S$800 million in 2016, up from the S$600 million in 2015.  The proportion paled in comparison to the average of 1.4 per cent that OECD countries spent in 2014 on the long-term care sector, according to the report. REGULATION OF CARE QUALITY NEEDED Another issue highlighted by the study is the lack of regulation in the sector. Unlike nursing homes and childcare centres, home-based and centre-based care are not licensed in Singapore. Only two out of about 60 private home care providers are subjected to mandatory service requirements stipulated by MOH because they receive Government grants and subsidies. Singapore therefore needs to strengthen the regulatory environment of community-based eldercare, said Assoc Prof Huang. \"The elderly and others needing care at home are particularly vulnerable groups. Safeguards for home care must be put in place,\" she said.  The study also emphasised the need to set accreditation, as well as training and certification standards for all providers and workers in the sector. There is also the challenge of attracting and retaining workers in the sector. At the media briefing, the panel said that some workers in the sector may be earning S$1,300 - less than a salesperson, who earns S$1,500. The study recommended public spending on community and home care be boosted to ease the cost burden on users and providers. It also called for the broadening of financing options by, for example, extending Medifund coverage. It also recommended that eldercare careers be boosted, and care competencies improved. In response to the findings, MOH said it will study the views and ideas raised. \"We welcome constructive conversation on these important and pressing issues, as we continue to work with partners and stakeholders to strengthen the provision of home and community care services,\" a spokesperson said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lien-foundation-cost-a-concern-seniors-who-want-to-age-in-place-10615662"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 05:39PM", "tags": ["Crazy Rich Asians", "box office"], "author": "", "title": "Crazy rich on film, proud to be Asian", "content": " LOS ANGELES: The film is called Crazy Rich Asians, but the cast is proud to be showcasing such a rare array of Asian culture and identity in a Hollywood movie.

Fresh Off the Boat actress Wu plays New York economics professor Rachel Chu, who flies to Singapore to meet her boyfriend's family only to discover that it is one of the wealthiest in the country. Amid the lavish parties and romantic setbacks, the film highlights the clash of Western and Asian cultures and the tension between old-money Chinese families in Singapore and the nouveau riche. It is also a love letter to Singapore, as the camera lingers on the city's modern and traditional architecture, parks, nearby tropical beaches, street food and music. \"I wanted to reflect that this was a warm place, that it wasn't a strange alien planet that you are going to, as Asia is often depicted,\" said director Jon M Chu, who was raised in California by Taiwanese parents and had never previously been to Singapore. The cast was drawn from Taiwan, Britain, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United States and Australia, along with Singapore, where it was filmed.  \"It was like a swap meet of experiences of being Asian in different countries,\" said Golding, who was born in Malaysia and raised in Britain. \"Everybody had struggled in some aspect with their identity, so to be able to share that and come together and strengthen together, you couldn't even imagine,\" he said.

Juma Khan Rasik Khan had made the police report over the molestation himself. On Nov 5 last year, he called the police and told them that \"one lady (followed) me to my house\".  He said the woman was his friend, according to court documents. He said he did not have sex with her, but admitted that he performed sexual acts on her.  \"Now she want to confront me and say that I (had sex with) her,\" he said. \"Can get the police to come?\" Investigations revealed that the victim, a 36-year-old woman who has been assessed by the Institute of Mental Health to have intellectual disability, was sitting at a void deck at about 1.15pm that day when Juma approached her. He asked her to follow him, and he took her to his home in Ang Mo Kio. He knew the woman, as he was acquainted with her father. In his room, Juma took off his clothes and asked the victim to remove hers as well. He then performed sexual acts on her, even though he was aware that the victim was intellectually disabled and would not be able to give her consent. The woman then said she wanted to leave the house, and they got dressed and left. She went back to the void deck, where she met some of her father's friends and told them what happened.

These days, however, Donki - as it popularly known - is more of a role model, defying Japan's weak retail environment to last week report its 29th year of unbroken sales and profit growth.  With sales projected to hit 1 trillion yen (US$9 billion) this year, Donki is joining the top ranks of Japan's heavyweight retail market, among the likes of Aeon Co Ltd, Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co Ltd and convenience store operator Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd.  The company says its success lies in its ability to amuse customers, who have tired of the efficient yet predictable shopping experiences at other Japanese stores. \"Our biggest rival is not Amazon or Aeon, but customers' losing interest,\" Mitsuo Takahashi, Don Quijote's chief financial officer, told Reuters in an interview. After struggling to find sites in some areas to fuel its sustained expansion, Donki has tied up with FamilyMart Uny Holdings to convert its struggling big box stores, delivering a rapid turnaround at the first six outlets to try the new format. And on Monday (Aug 13), the discounter said it would be interested in buying Walmart Inc's Seiyu supermarket unit, reflecting its increasingly ubiquitous presence on Japan's shopping streets, where it has replaced stores struggling in the new economy. As Amazon grows rapidly in Japan, Donki aims to increase the fun of visiting stores by making its app more interactive - with points to collect and discounts to find - in a doubling down on its store-focused approach. \"If Amazon is like downloading music, we are like a concert venue. Both are needed,\" Donki Chief Executive Koji Ohara said on Monday. THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT Shoppers at Donki are welcomed by tanks of exotic fish before they enter a maze-like warren piled high with goods ranging from face-massaging gadgets to oversized bags of potato chips. What feels like a pell-mell approach is actually a finely honed company strategy, the result of decades of experimentation in each store. First-time customers often come away bewildered and humming the store's unending earworm of a theme song, but return for more, drawn back by a constantly changing array of goods.  Many of the products Donki sells are cast off from other retailers, a result of the Japanese penchant for a huge variety of seasonal, limited edition and experimental products, from cans of beer splashed with cherry blossom patterns to yogurt-flavored water. Stocking decisions are left to store staff, and financial incentives help motivate them to source and display wares effectively. The approach is a far cry from how head offices micromanage the operations of many large Japanese retailers. With every store catering to local tastes, \"you cannot create a strategy that will be effective against all of their stores,\" Jefferies analyst Michael Jon Allen said of Donki's rivals. RIDING FORTH Donki also has a growing range of store formats, including smaller Picasso stores, giant Mega Don Quijote and even a Platinum Don Quijote selling high-end products. Looking to expand but faced with a shortage of suitable suburban locations, Donki last year took a 40 per cent stake in the merchandise store unit of FamilyMart Uny Holdings. It's an unlikely marriage of disparate corporate cultures. But so far it seems successful: the companies' first six Donki-style stores have almost doubled sales in the five months to July, with a further 20 stores to be converted in 2019. That is helping push Donki toward its target of 500 stores by 2020, from 420 stores currently. Uny has almost 200 locations. The purchase of part or all of Walmart's Seiyu chain would mark a dramatic acceleration of that expansion. Walmart says it has not made a decision to sell Seiyu. DON DON DONKI Donki's newest frontier is overseas, with two \"Don Don Donki\" stores opened in Singapore in the last year and another due to open in Bangkok this year. Founder Takao Yasuda, who moved to Singapore after retiring three years ago, drove the expansion there after finding Japanese products too costly. Prices are as much as 50 per cent lower than rivals, said Takahashi, the CFO. The Singapore stores are stocked mainly with food and drink, leveraging Japan's culinary reputation. Donki's \"yaki-imo\" or baked sweet potato is its best-selling product.  Singapore-based Euromonitor analyst Chayadi Karim said Don Quijote has tweaked its strategy in Singapore, where shoppers are unburdened by a deflationary mindset and \"are willing to pay that premium for Japanese products.\" Southeast Asian expansion, with several new stores opening annually, along with 28 outlets in Hawaii and California, are building Donki's food retailing expertise. Concerns about overly rapid expansion weighed on the company's shares this year, and like all Japanese retailers, it faces headwinds from the country's aging population and growing affection for online retailers. But for now, its ability to make money seems to be resilient. In the most recent quarter Donki's gross margin - a key measure of profitability - climbed 0.4 per cent on a year earlier to 26.6 per cent.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/japan-s-don-quijote-rides-high-on-rule-breaking-reputation-10616226"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 04:11PM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Indonesia", "Team Singapore"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "‘We look forward to a lot of personal bests’: Team Singapore’s Asian Games Chef de Mission ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Team Singapore athletes may not have a fixed set of medal targets for the 2018 Asian Games, but their goal nonetheless will be to improve on their previous performances, said Chef de Mission Lee Wung Yew on Tuesday (Aug 14). He added that he looks forward to “a lot of personal bests” from the athletes. “Everybody has their KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), but we try to limit the kind of stress that they will go through, so why count the chickens before they hatch? (We will) let their actions speak for themselves,” Mr Lee told reporters before leaving for Jakarta where the Games will kick off on Saturday. “What’s important is for them to go there, do their best and see what happens. We want them to better their (previous) performances, and we look forward to a lot of personal bests from our athletes.” Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu had said last month that there are no “specific” targets for the contingent, and Mr Lee added that this will take some pressure off the athletes. “I believe there will be less pressure - the spotlight is not on them, they don’t have to see their names in the media - how many golds they are going to get,” said Mr Lee, a former national shooter who represented Singapore six times at the Asian Games and thrice at the Olympic Games. The contingent of 265 athletes across 21 sports is Singapore’s largest at an Asian Games. At the 2014 edition in Incheon, Team Singapore’s 223-strong contingent clinched five golds, six silvers and 14 bronze medals.  There are expectations for athletes to deliver in swimming, sailing and bowling, having won medals in these sports in past Asian Games, said Mr Lee. “We are seeing more and more of our athletes making their way to (perform at) world levels,” he added. “These are things that are looking good for us.” ALL GEARED UP  Singapore’s Asian Games contingent will also have to come to grips with the environment in Indonesia, with lingering pollution concerns due to haze from forest fires. Traffic congestion in Indonesia's sprawling capital of 10 million also consistently ranks among the world's worst, although Games organisers have been trying to mitigate the issue with measures such as dedicated lanes. To prepare them for the journey, Team Singapore’s athletes will get a travel essential kit, which comes complete with a 3M mask, hand sanitizer, ear plugs and a neck pillow, among other things. “There were spikes in the haze situation so these masks are a precautionary measure,” explained Mr Lee. “In the event that it (the air quality) hits certain levels, athletes can use these things depending on their level of tolerance.” External factors aside, Mr Lee believes that the athletes are ready to compete and are happy with the guidance some of the senior athletes have provided to their less experienced counterparts. “They have been doing their part,” he said. “I see them performing the big brother and big sister roles - this is encouraging as it helps the younger athletes settle down and I want more of the veterans to take up these kinds of roles.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/team-singapore-asian-games-goals-chef-de-mission-10615746"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 02:06PM", "tags": ["court", "crime", "Ferrari driver"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Ferrari driver pleads guilty to three separate charges, including drink driving", "content": " SINGAPORE: Ferrari driver Shi Ka Yee who pleaded guilty just last month to obstructing Orchard Road with her car two years ago, admitted on Tuesday (Aug 14) to drink driving and two other separate charges. The drink driving incident occurred on Jan 31, 2017. Two police officers attending to a 999 call went to the Grand Hyatt hotel in Scotts Road and saw 73-year-old Shi who reeked of alcohol. Her gait was unsteady and her speech was slurred, court documents said. One of the officers advised Shi not to drive and to take a taxi home instead, but she insisted that she was capable of driving her vehicle. Despite repeated advice from the officer not to drive, Shi rushed towards her vehicle and drove it out of the driveway before she was stopped by the officer. The officer conducted a breathalyser test on her, but she was uncooperative for almost 20 minutes. Eventually, the officer arrested her for failing to provide a breath specimen and took her back to Tanglin Police Station, where a blood alcohol analysis showed that her blood sample had 103 milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of blood, more than the prescribed limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of blood.  Investigations later revealed that Shi had drunk a glass of wine while having dinner at the Grand Hyatt, before going to a night club at the basement of the hotel and consuming two glasses of gin and tonic. TWO MORE CHARGES The two separate charges, from 2015, involved confining a man in a crane bucket and committing a rash act by driving her vehicle until it came into contact with her neighbor. On Feb 17, 2015, five workers hired by Shi's neighbour, Mr Nasrat Muzayyin, arrived at 13 Astrid Hill with a lorry crane to prune parts of a tree from Shi's property next door. The tree had branches that encroached onto Mr Nasrat's home, and he had tried asking for the branches to be trimmed since October 2014. One of the workers, 35-year-old Indian national Mr Ankathi Thirupathi, was given the role of standing in the crane bucket and pruning the encroaching branches with a chainsaw. Another worker controlled the crane from the ground, while the remaining workers cleaned up the fallen branches. At about 9.30am, Shi arrived in her car and entered her neighbour's house to confront him, using vulgarities on him. She said: \"You cut my tree, my tree is a living thing, I hope your kids die.\" Shi then went to the lorry crane, turned off the engine and removed the key while Mr Ankathi was in the elevated crane bucket. He was stuck there for about an hour before being rescued by officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. SHE DROVE HER CAR UNTIL IT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH NEIGHBOUR The other workers went to tell Nasrat what happened, and he went to Shi's house to confront her and retrieve the key, saying that he needed it to release Mr Ankathi and would call the police if she did not comply. Shi refused and used vulgarities on her neighbour, challenging him to call the police. She then drove her vehicle out with the driver's window partially wound down. Her neighbour stood in front of her car to prevent her from leaving, and to get the key from her. He asked her to wait for the police to arrive, but Shi refused and drove her car forward until it came into contact with him. Mr Nasrat moved aside for his own safety and Shi drove off, telling him that she was going out of town to Hong Kong. Shi's defence lawyer asked for mitigation and sentencing to be adjourned until after this Friday, when Shi will be appealing against her conviction and sentence for voluntarily causing hurt to another motorist. She will be back in court for these three charges at the end of the month.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ferrari-driver-shi-ka-yee-plead-guilty-drink-driving-10615576"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 01:46PM", "tags": ["Singapore Management University", "SingHealth"], "author": "Gwyneth Teo", "title": "SMU, SingHealth to train undergraduates in healthcare administration", "content": " SINGAPORE: From January next year, undergraduates at the Singapore Management University (SMU) will be able to take specialised modules in healthcare management to work toward a second major in Health Economics and Management.

But there’s more to the 62-year-old playwright than beloved stage classics about National Service hijinks and nostalgic Singapore. Back in 1992, Chiang came up with a bittersweet comedy about three transsexuals who are befriended by a talk show host eager to get them to guest in his show. Private Parts was unlike anything that had been staged in Singapore at that point – and while it may not ring a bell among millennials the way his two big hits do, it was a groundbreaking, critically acclaimed piece that was eventually staged a handful of times. After its sold-out debut at the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1992, a Mandarin version starring Edmund Chen and the late comedian Hua Liang was staged two years later. Its last professional staging was back in 2004 at the Esplanade. This November, it will be restaged yet again. Directed by Beatrice Chia-Richmond – who will be the first woman to helm the play – it will star Chua Enlai, Zee Wong, Shane Mardjuki and Jason Godfrey. The gender-themed play is close to Chiang’s heart – in fact, it’s the one he’s proudest of. “It may not be as well known as, say Army Daze, which has been translated into a movie and is a lot more recognisable and 'mass', but I feel this is my strongest work in terms of writing,” he told CNA Lifestyle. For this version of Private Parts – which officially kicks off his new theatre company, Michael Chiang Playthings – the playwright pointed out that they’ll be going back to the original script instead of updating it, which is what he usually does to older scripts. “Beatrice and I thought it would be more meaningful to have it set in the 1990s, mainly because the scene has changed quite a lot,” he explained. “There’s more awareness of the trans community now. It’s less of a mystery and you can easily find out about it online or in TV shows. I wanted to retain that mystique of a world we weren’t privy to. I felt it’s more important to remind people of a more innocent time – in a more ironic way. Back then, people were not as exposed, and how (audiences) reacted to the characters was really very fresh.” He added: “Back then, we didn’t have Ru Paul’s Drag Race or Caitlyn Jenner – it wasn’t part of the social fabric and pop culture we’re now exposed to.” As if to underscore the difference between then and now, Chiang actually reached out to Professor Tommy Koh for his thoughts on Private Parts. Back in 1992, Koh was the Chairperson of both the National Arts Council and the Censorship Review Committee – and had been asked by the media about his thoughts on the then-new production. In the recent Private Parts press release, Koh was quoted as saying the play “helped to bring about a paradigm change in Singapore theatre” and that “the culture of tolerance and acceptance of diversity has grown stronger… Singapore has become more liberal and more open to new ideas and alternative views.” Does Chiang think younger Singaporeans, who are probably only familiar with his big hits, will be surprised to discover he had written a play about transsexuals? “I hope not,” he quipped. “I think there’s still quite a lot of my trademark style in there. It’s still a recognisably Singaporean story. I’ve always wanted to make sure the characters are always the people that audiences care for and it’s one of those shows where people remember the characters very well.” Private Parts will run from Nov 2 to 18 at Drama Centre. Tickets available from Sistic.

How consumerism and affluence fuelled the rise of a youth subculture  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Chef Chen Siyuan, 31, counts watching films by American director Wes Anderson and listening to indie music by artists such as Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience as his hobbies. His taste in film and music has led some of his friends to call him a \"hipster\". But he demurs at the tag. \"You don't really want to be labelled, that's the irony (of a hipster) I guess,\" added Mr Chen. The rise of \"hipster\" culture in Singapore is unmistakable, with the term becoming a part of Singaporeans' daily lexicon. From artisan cafes, yoga studios to fashion boutiques, the imported youth subculture seems to have found its spiritual home here, so much so that it has not been bogged down by its negative connotations. In fact, for some, being a hipster has become a status symbol, experts say. The rise of hipster enclaves in Singapore and the disamenities generated by them were in the spotlight recently. Last month, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) rezoned parts of the Tiong Bahru estate, following feedback from affected residents. Local news also reported about the unhappiness of some residents – especially the elderly – with the noise and the crowds, particularly during weekends, at other hipster enclaves in Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates including those at Everton Park and Jalan Besar. But what is the hipster culture? And why has it flourished here? Its roots have been traced by some experts to the United States in the late 1990s in Brooklyn, New York and Silver Lake, Los Angeles, said National University of Singapore sociologist Joshua Kurz. Those cities were extremely violent then, and the authorities introduced various measures to bring down the crime rate. But these efforts were deemed to have sterilised the cities and stripped the neighbourhoods of their street culture, leading to a pushback among youth to reclaim these spaces, said Dr Kurz. \"Hipsters came as a response … resurrecting the old, finding the new before anybody else does and turning it into the next hot, new cultural thing,\" he explained. Later, businesses in the US started to market their products to this group of youths including stores selling vinyl records and brands such as lifestyle retailer Urban Outfitters and clothing brand American Apparel. Experts broadly define it as a movement of individuals looking for originality, to be different and not conform to mainstream interests and lifestyles. \"It refers to a millennial generation searching for authentic alternative lifestyles which they believe comes from a seemingly more innocent past before the internet and mass manufacturing,\" said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun of Nanyang Technological University's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. It is unclear when the hipster culture first appeared in Singapore, but experts including Dr Kurz narrowed it down to some time around the 2000s. Part of the problem in determining the birth of the subculture here is the reluctance of people to identify themselves as part of a hipster culture – a paradoxical characteristic of hipsters anywhere in the world. Dr Kurz said:  Unlike another subculture like the punks, where those who identify themselves as one readily call themselves one, hipsters hate such label. Some aspects of the hipster culture are also contradictory, said Mr Sherman Tan, a PhD candidate at the Australian National University and visiting research scholar at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Mr Tan co-authored a study in 2014 titled The Rise of \"Hipster\" Culture in Singapore: Spatial Transformation in Tiong Bahru. Noting that the unwillingness of hipsters to define themselves as such \"gives us a clue to what being hipster is about\", Mr Tan pointed out that some say hipsters have a peculiar aesthetic style – a look that is relaxed and unbothered. While this suggests that they are unbothered by social standing, it contradicts how the subculture is seen as a way for middle-class youths to distinguish themselves from their peers, Mr Tan pointed out. In Singapore, people tend to put the label on others and rarely on themselves, he added. \"That's where you start hearing, 'Eh, don't be so hipster la' among Singaporeans,\" he said. \"But there is an unacknowledged desire for difference and uniqueness (among hipsters), and it's not a uniquely Singapore trend.\" In the Singapore context, it is the clamour for a sense of identity among a large middle class, which has been around for some time, in a densely-populated city, said Mr Tan. When old buildings gave way to new ones, Singaporeans also became anxious about its built heritage, and looked to preserve the aesthetics of the past – a common trait of hipster culture. The experts said the hipster culture could have been driven by the droves of Singaporeans returning home after studying overseas in the late 90s and early 2000s, and were drawn to businesses that seemed to cater to the hipster lifestyle. For example, after Forty Hands cafe set up its first outlet along Yong Siak Street in 2010, other indie stores such as book store BooksActually set up shop in the vicinity. Haji Lane soon became a hipster spot around 2013, with a string of indie fashion boutiques drawing a strong following among youths. WHO'S A HIPSTER? \"Trendy\", \"different\", \"cool\", \"pretentious\", and \"vintage\" – these are some of the words which Singaporeans interviewed associate with the hipster culture. Most agreed that hipsters here are people who try to be different from the crowd, and are often seen as trendy or fashionable. They like to visit artisanal cafes, and areas such as Tiong Bahru, Haji Lane, Holland Village and Everton Park. When it comes to hipster fashion, floral-print shirts, vintage outfits, rolled-up skinny jeans and canvas totes spring to mind. Mr Amir Mohamed, 19, is one of the few hipsters who accept the label – though not all of it. \"I do what I like so I'm pretty much a hipster in that sense … (most) Singaporeans probably think they want to get a degree and get a good job. But for me, I don't want to be under someone, I want to be my own boss, I want to be in a position where I can say, 'oh this is what I want and I can do it,\" he said. His taste in music is also what sets him apart as a hipster, added the aspiring musician who listens to a wide range of music, from jazz to hip-hop. However, he said he does not identify with hipsters when it comes to fashion and food choices.  \"I don't really follow hipster trends like drinking at (cafes), I really love my teh-tarik,\" he said. Undergraduates Shermaine Lim, 19, and Sonia Lee, 20, admitted that they might have a hipster's preference in their choice of literature, favouring local authors and poetry as opposed to more mainstream authors. But they quipped that it is too expensive to maintain a hipster lifestyle, which would include food such as avocado toasts. Ms Lee noted that some youths may adopt a hipster lifestyle to get more \"likes\" on social media. However, Ms Cheryl Chong, who is in business development, felt that the hipster culture has become commercialised today. It used to reflect a person's hobby and interests but now, it seems to be about businesses such as cafes, fashion boutiques, bookshops and music stores, said the 32-year-old. A BYWORD FOR CONSUMERISM With the dominance of international brands and shopping malls in Singapore, there will inevitably be a small group of consumers who reject these and search instead for local stores and less popular items, said Dr Kurz. And \"hipster\" shops here say they are merely catering to this demand. Barbershop Mr Moustache, located at Everton Park, for instance, exudes a hipster vibe by pairing its take on classic hairstyling and shaving services for men with a vintage-styled interior, such as retro-looking barber chairs. Co-founder Victor Tan said his business is considered hipster because it tries to reinvent the traditional craft.  \"I'm not a hipster, I'm too old for this … but my barber shop is, and so are the (style of) hair cuts,\" said Mr Tan, who declined to reveal his age.  \"Singaporeans are quite conservative, so I'm happy that at least, there are people who are willing to try our (style) of haircuts,\" he added. Since 2006, fashion boutique Saladshop, located in Haji Lane, has been bringing in a selection of women's wear different from what can be found at shopping malls. About one or two years later, people started to use the term \"hipster\" to describe such concept stores, said Saladshop owner Eileen Teo, 40. While her idea of hipsters are creative individuals who make bold selections, she admitted the term has since become too generic. The word may not reflect the level seriousness or professionalism shown by those who work hard to select and bring in items for a certain concept store or style, she added. The hipster fever has engulfed even the traditional hawker centres: For example, the newly-opened Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre has been marketed as the first to offer both traditional and hipster cuisines at affordable prices. Mr Mohammed Rafi, 35, co-owner of Burgernomics at the hawker centre, said he does not really like the \"hipster\" label. However, the marketing strategy has managed to draw a younger crowd, which is the burger stall's target audience. \"It's just like graffiti … if you give someone a space to do graffiti, the essence of it is no longer there,\" he said of the \"hipster\" label. He added:  It's an 'in' term to use, but it has also been used too much that it has become, a very – for the lack of a better word – 'obiang' (Hokkien word for out of fashion) term to use. Coffee joint Forty Hands is seen by many to have contributed to Tiong Bahru's evolution into a hipster enclave, after its success ushered in several more indie stores in the area. While the rush of trendy businesses has revived the once-sleepy estate, it has also been criticised for gentrification. Director of Forty Hands cafe Harry Grover, 37, said his target audience was not the hipster crowd but he is \"more than willing to take (their) money\". The idea for a cafe came from wanting to \"do something cool and original\", after he realised that Singapore had the market for a \"third wave of coffee\" after coffee chains like Starbucks, he said. The so-called \"third wave of coffee\" is a movement to emphasise an appreciation of high-quality coffee, the production process, and alternative preparation methods, among other things. \"We wanted a proper business that services hundreds of customers, that built its name on merit, not just because it is located in a hipster neighbourhood,\" he said. He added that while the hipster crowd is part of his clientele, he is not too concerned even if the subculture disappears further down the road. EVER EVOLVING While the hipster culture has flourished in Singapore over the last two decades, it is not clear how it could evolve, the experts said. Reiterating that some Singaporeans have taken to the hipster culture to differentiate themselves socially and find a sense of identity, Mr Tan, the visiting research scholar at NUS, noted the presence of a dominant and affluent middle class in the Republic, who have the means to pursue such a lifestyle. For some in Singapore, a hipster lifestyle is in fact something to aspire to, notwithstanding the reluctance to embrace the label. In contrast, the term carries negative connotations in the US, where it is often used in a derogatory manner and associated with \"middle-class trust fund youths\", said Mr Tan. \"It's in everyday Singapore conversations, where you turn to your friend and say, 'wah that's so hipster'. And it doesn't really connote bad or good, it just very simply describes the visual styling of something and the aesthetics of it,\" he added. Dr Kurz noted that Singapore is one of the few places where media portrayal of \"hipsters\" has not been too negative.  He also pointed out that unlike in some other countries, hipsterism here is not so much about being anti-establishment, but more about aesthetics, fashion and trends. It also revolves around cafes given Singapore's food culture, he added. Another factor underpinning its rise in the Republic is the younger generation's anxiety with the country's rapidly changing landscape, said NTU's Asst Prof Liew. Colonial shophouses and early public estates are seen to be \"more rustic, quaint, distinct and therefore cool\", he noted. It is no coincidence that images of these places are frequently put up by hipsters on social media platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest, he added. Asst Prof Liew concedes that he used to think hipster cafes and retailers were gentrifying some of the HDB heartlands and conservation districts including Tiong Bahru. His perception changed when he realised that some of these shops actually add to the local culture and environment. \"Better an independent hipster design shop by enterprising youths than another faceless branch of some big brands,\" he pointed out. Still, Dr Kurz said some experts have argued that the hipster culture could be unwittingly threatened by businesses seeking to cash in on it – even as others see this as an evolution of the culture. \"It's been made into a brand identity. As soon as (stores) like Urban Outfitters, American Apparel and many other kinds of businesses started specifically catering this group of people, you can argue that what made the culture specific and interesting has died,\" he said. In Singapore, where hipster culture is sometimes manifested in physical spaces, its fate in the coming years could also hinge on practical considerations and government policies, Dr Kurz said. Referring to the Tiong Bahru rezoning exercise, he noted that this would have an impact on youths living or setting up business in the area. \"Changing the zoning laws could fundamentally disrupt this neighbourhood (and the subcultures),\" he added. Nevertheless, for Mr Tan, the fundamental ideal of the hipster movement – resistance to modernity – will never go away. It stretches as far back as after the French Revolution in the 18th century. Over the ensuing centuries, such resistance has come in the form of religion or spirituality, he said. On the malleability and durability of the hipster culture, he added:  People still have this idea that hipsterism is relatively new or it's really an innovative trend. But it isn't … hipsterism is really the latest reincarnation of a resistance to the modern mainstream.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hipster-consumerism-and-rise-of-youth-subculture-in-singapore-10611826"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 06:10AM", "tags": ["Vienna", "Melbourne", "Australia", "Europe", "Economist Intelligence Unit", "Global Liveability Index"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore loses lead over Hong Kong in list of world's most liveable cities", "content": " SINGAPORE: Hong Kong has reclaimed its lead over Singapore in an annual global survey of liveable cities, with a marginal difference of 0.1 per cent. Hong Kong - whose ranking on Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Global Liveability Index fell dramatically in 2015 due to heightened fears of unrest as part of the so-called Umbrella Revolution - was overtaken by Singapore in the rankings for the first time last year. It has largely recovered and placed 35th in this year's rankings, two spots ahead of Singapore, which ranked 37th, according to an EIU press release. In its own turn, Singapore's score also registered an improvement in the public healthcare category, boasting the highest possible score, the release said. EIU's liveability rating, part of the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, assigns scores to 140 cities based on stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. After seven years at the top, Melbourne has been displaced by Vienna as the most liveable city in this year's ranking. The two metropolises have been neck and neck in the annual survey for years. This year, a downgraded threat of militant attacks in western Europe as well as the city's low crime rate helped nudge Vienna into first place. At the other end of the table, Damascus retained last place, followed by the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, and Lagos in Nigeria. The survey does not include several of the world's most dangerous capitals, such as Baghdad and Kabul. \"While in the past couple of years cities in Europe were affected by the spreading perceived threat of terrorism in the region, which caused heightened security measures, the past year has seen a return to normalcy,\" the EIU said in a statement about the report published on Tuesday. \"A long-running contender to the title, Vienna has succeeded in displacing Melbourne from the top spot due to increases in the Austrian capital's stability category ratings,\" it said, referring to one of the index's five headline components. Vienna and Melbourne scored maximum points in the healthcare, education and infrastructure categories. But while Melbourne extended its lead in the culture and environment component, that was outweighed by Vienna's improved stability ranking. Osaka, Calgary and Sydney completed the top five in the survey, which the EIU says tends to favour medium-sized cities in wealthy countries, often with relatively low population densities. Much larger and more crowded cities tend to have higher crime rates and more strained infrastructure, it said. London for instance ranks 48th. Vienna, once the capital of a large empire rather than today's small Alpine republic, has yet to match its pre-World War I population of 2.1 million.  Its many green spaces include lakes with popular beaches and vineyards with sweeping views of the capital. Public transport is cheap and efficient. In addition to the generally improved security outlook for western Europe, Vienna benefited from its low crime rate, the survey's editor Roxana Slavcheva said. \"One of the sub-categories that Vienna does really well in is the prevalence of petty crime ... It's proven to be one of the safest cities in Europe,\" she said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-loses-lead-hong-kong-liveable-cities-eiu-10614876"}, {"datetime": "14 Aug 2018 05:00AM", "tags": ["National Day Rally", "Lee Hsien Loong", "NDR 2018"], "author": "", "title": "PM Lee to deliver National Day Rally speech on Aug 19 at ITE College Central", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will deliver his National Day Rally 2018 speech on Sunday, Aug 19 at the Institute of Technical Education College Central at Ang Mo Kio.

The open-air car park will be kept open until the end of October while the two-storey car park will remain open until August next year, Mr Marc Boey, the director of planning and acquisitions at Far East Organisation, said in a statement on Monday (Aug 13). He was also speaking on behalf of joint venture developers Sekisui House and Sino Group.  The closing dates of the car parks may be adjusted as the planning for the development progresses, Mr Boey added. Two temporary pedestrian connections will also be constructed to link Holland Village to two interim car parks, with 350 lots, at Holland Drive, he said. Both existing car parks at Holland Village offer a total of 405 lots. It was earlier reported that the car parks would be closed from Monday, the same day the developer took possession of the site.  Stirling Land Holdings, a consortium led by Far East Organisation, was awarded the tender for a 99-year-old leasehold land parcel at Holland Road in May. Information boards and directional signs will be put up when the car parks are due to close to inform the public of the changes in traffic circulation plans for the area, according to a flyer distributed at Holland Village which was seen by Channel NewsAsia. The two-storey car park is expected to be demolished in September next year.  The new development will include a new basement car park that will provide 486 car lots and 56 motorcycle lots, according to the flyer. Its projected completion date is in 2025. \"We are committed to keeping the existing car parks open for as long as possible before construction work commences,\" Mr Boey said.  \"We also remain keenly sensitive to the needs of the existing community. Hence, we are working hard to minimise any potential disruptions to the existing businesses and community at Holland Village.\" The Housing and Development Board (HDB) had earlier distributed notices from Aug 1 informing motorists of the closure of the open-air car park. HDB also highlighted alternative parking spots, namely the car parks opposite Blocks 18 and 21 Holland Drive, and at Block 5A Holland Close and Block 10A Holland Drive.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Despite the flyers and notices, restaurant owners and hawkers that Channel NewsAsia spoke to said they were not aware of the extension of the car park’s closure.

At least for our customers, they will still come back to us, then we’ll see what we can do in the next two months.” Superfudo, which opened 10 months ago, has already seen a slump in business. Its managing consultant Donna Tang said it was quieter, especially during lunchtime. “It’s only been one day but based on the rough calculations we’ve done, when the car park does close, 400 lots equate to about 100,000 fewer customers a month and that’s going to affect all of us,” said Ms Tang. Grillhouse iSTEAKS Diner is calling it quits after six years of business at Holland Village. The restaurant's owner Ivan Loo said the decision to move was not difficult.  “With the expected closure of the car park, it means that opportunities will shrink, with an even smaller pie.” He added that businesses have historically been affected when construction works happen. “We anticipated that it’s going to be like how the construction of MRT stations has affected Holland Village, Cheong Chin Nam and right now, Upper Thomson. So that scenario is probably going to repeat itself here,” said Mr Loo. Meanwhile, some customers welcome the changes and said the closure of the car park will not affect their decision to frequent the area.

Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, bought the Bombardier Global 5000 jet for US$35.4 million in 2010 using funds allegedly taken from 1MDB, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has said. Malaysia is seeking to repossess the jet which, according to some media reports, was grounded last year in Singapore. Jet Aviation said on Monday a Bombardier Global 5000 with the same registration number as the one identified by DOJ was at its facility at Seletar Airport in Singapore. A spokeswoman told Reuters the firm was \"working closely with the local authorities\". She declined to say how the firm came to be in possession of the aircraft. Authorities in Malaysia and the United States are investigating how billions of dollars went missing from 1MDB. The DOJ says more than US$4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund, with some of the money used to buy the private jet, a superyacht, Picasso paintings, jewellery and real estate. Singapore, one of at least six countries investigating 1MDB, said in 2016 it had frozen about S$120 million of funds and properties belonging to Low and his immediate family. \"We have to bring it back,\" Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Sunday when asked if Malaysia would take possession of the Bombardier jet. Last week, the US$250 million superyacht Equanimity, which the DOJ says was also bought by Jho Low, was handed over to Malaysia by Indonesia, which had seized the asset earlier this year. A spokesman for Low's legal team has said the handing over of the Equanimity yacht to Malaysia was illegal and in violation of Indonesian and US court orders. In civil lawsuits filed in the United States, the DOJ is seeking to seize assets that were allegedly bought with 1MDB money. The scandal at 1MDB fully erupted in 2015 after media reports that hundreds of millions of dollars from the state fund were diverted to former prime minister Najib Razak's personal accounts. Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that those funds were donations from a Saudi royal, and that the bulk of them had been given back. Low has been accused of being a key figure in the scandal and Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant, but his whereabouts are unknown. Low, whose Malaysian passport has been revoked, has previously denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman for Low, through his attorneys, on Monday said if Mahathir's intention to seize the private jet was \"anything like his illegal seizure of the Equanimity\", Mahathir will ignore ongoing legal processes and conduct a trial by media.

For the first half of 2018, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis.  But while the Government kept to its estimated range for full-year growth, it flagged slower growth for the following six months.  Economists agreed, with one expecting GDP for the second half of the year to be half of what was achieved during January to June. “We are looking at a fairly significant slowdown in the second half,” said Nomura analyst Brian Tan, who has a full-year forecast of 3 per cent for the Singapore economy.  “With the first half being 4.2 per cent, we are expecting about 2 per cent growth for the second half to have about 3 per cent for the full year,” he explained.  While this moderation in the pace of economic expansion, due to high base effects following the manufacturing-led growth spurt last year, is within expectations, economists said a storm of external risks has fuelled uncertainties.  These factors include slower global growth, the possibility of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates faster than expected and the US ratcheting up global trade tensions with tariff threats.  “Given the base effects, everyone had a ‘faster first half, slower second half’ expectation and that has not changed,” said Mr Edward Lee, regional head of research for Southeast Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.  “But what has changed is the deteriorating trade narrative between the US and China. On the financial market side, there is clearly a lot more volatility largely due to weakness in the emerging market space as the Fed goes on quantitative tightening.”  Last month, 25 per cent tariffs on the first tranche of Chinese products valued at US$34 billion took effect, with Beijing responding in kind on the same value of US goods. More duties are set to be imposed on another US$16 billion worth of Chinese goods on Aug 23.  The Trump administration has also said that it may jack up the tariff rate on the next US$200 billion of Chinese imports – a proposal that China has said it would hit back with new tariffs on US$60 billion worth of American goods.  The latter, if rolled out, would clearly have a bigger impact on global demand and supply chains, said Mr Lee. Echoing that, DBS senior economist Irvin Seah said trade friction between the US and China could indirectly affect Singapore given that they are the country’s biggest export markets.  Tighter liquidity conditions and mounting pressure on regional currencies could also weigh down on investor confidence and business sentiments, he added.  “Watch trade figures in the coming months for tell-tale signs for slowdown in growth. Expectations are for the third quarter’s growth to be the weakest this year, which will also pare down consensus expectations for the full year growth rate,” said Mr Seah, while adding that still expects Singapore’s growth for 2018 to be 3 per cent.  MAS STILL POISED TO TIGHTEN IN OCTOBER: EXPERTS Still, economists reckoned that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) likely remains in tightening mode.  Nomura's Mr Tan, for one, is pencilling in another slight increase in the slope of the Singapore dollar's policy band when the central bank meets in October for its semi-annual policy meeting. “Growth remaining on track to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent, the labour market staying on a gradual recovery, and core inflation on a gradual rise to hit 2 per cent in the later part of this year – as long as the base case remains intact, they will continue to normalise.”  He added that a growth slowdown driven by base effects is unlikely to sway MAS from further tightening, unless signs of further escalation in tit-for-tat tariffs or hints of a significant slowdown in global growth emerge.  Nonetheless, Standard Chartered’s Mr Lee cautioned that the possibility of the MAS standing pat has increased.  “With the narrative changing quite a bit, there are some concerns whether the slowdown is going to accelerate. I wouldsay the risk has increased for them to stay status quo,” he told Channel NewsAsia.  When asked by reporters during Monday’s briefing, MAS’ deputy managing director Jacqueline Loh described the central bank’s decision to tighten policy in April as based on expectations for steady economic growth and gradual rise in core inflation over 2018.  She added that the growth slowdown was “anticipated” and inflationary pressures are likely to persist.  With that, the central bank’s current monetary policy remains appropriate, said Ms Loh.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/faster-first-half-slower-second-half-singapore-economy-gdp-10612720"}, {"datetime": "13 Aug 2018 05:20PM", "tags": ["NTUC", "coaching"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "NTUC plans to form association to look after instructors, coaches", "content": " SINGAPORE: The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) plans to form a new association to support instructors and coaches, it said on Monday (Aug 13). The National Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA) aims to look after those who teach sports, music, fitness, dance and wellness in schools and communities. They make up about 5,000 full-time freelancers, including those who coach at Sport Singapore and People’s Association, and co-curricular activities at schools. “NTUC has been working with various groups of coaches and instructors, and we realise that they face similar issues, common threats and training needs,” said NTUC assistant director-general and director of the Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit Ang Hin Kee. He added that due to the nature of their work, these coaches and instructors are susceptible to physical injuries or illnesses that can easily put them out of work for weeks without income.  Hence, NICA will introduce an insurance plan catered to their needs, in line with recommendations made by the Tripartite Workgroup on Self-Employed Persons.  NICA members will be able to enjoy up to 50 per cent discount off their premium for the first year for a prolonged medical leave insurance product.  NTUC said more details on the insurance providers and products will be announced at a later date. Mr Ang estimates that the insurance plan will cost about S$1 a day, providing coverage of about S$50 to S$80 daily. NTUC is in talks with several insurers, both local and foreign, to find a suitable plan, he added. Justin Teh, a freelance netball coach, told reporters that as it is now, freelancers are \"fragmented\" throughout the industries and have no bargaining power.  \"There's no organisation or united front that looks after our welfare, contracts and our progress,\" Mr Teh said.  \"With the new association, it brings together a huge body. This representation will give us the ability to speak to buyers and also form a tripartite alliance with stakeholders.\"  Labour chief Ng Chee Meng said instructors and coaches he had met told him that they felt government procurement systems can be \"fairer\" to the coaches and instructors. \"Their wages have not risen for quite a few years and because of the market competition, their services, in terms of remuneration, have been somewhat depressed,\" Mr Ng said.  \"So coming together as NTUC, I think we can afford better representation for them as a group to better understand their needs and to work better with Government.\"  NICA members can enjoy a “full suite” of NTUC benefits, including insurance coverage against death and disability, a S$250 training voucher for courses, as well as deals and discounts with merchant partners.

Ong Han You, who is now 20, admitted to three charges of negligent driving causing death, failure to render assistance and cheating. Five other charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. On May 21, 2016, Ong, then 17, was driving his 15-year-old girlfriend home at about 8am. He had asked a friend, Tan Jun Jie, to rent the car using another person's NRIC. Ong was driving behind a motorcycle when it came to a stop at a red light at the T-junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2, court documents said. Ong lost control of his car when his right hand slipped off the steering wheel. The car collided forcefully into the rear of the motorcycle, flinging both the motorcyclist and his 45-year-old pillion rider off. After crashing into the motorcycle, Ong's car continued to surge forward into the rightmost lane of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, towards Upper Thomson Road and against the flow of traffic. The vehicle collided with the front of a taxi before stopping. After the accident, Ong alighted from his car and saw the pillion rider, Madam Lau Lee Kiaw, lying on a grass patch breathing heavily. He called out to her and observed that she was injured and could not respond to him. After this, he abandoned the rented car and left the scene with his girlfriend, flagging down a taxi and leaving in it \"as he was afraid of the consequences of his actions\", court documents said. Madam Lau, the mother of two children, was taken to hospital along with the motorcyclist, who was her fiance. The taxi driver was also taken to hospital. Madam Lau died later that same day, with an autopsy report certifying her cause of death as blunt force chest injuries.

HE PICKED UP A DRIVING LICENCE, NRIC NEAR A CLUB Investigations revealed that Ong had picked up a wallet containing a driving licence and NRIC near a club in December 2015. In March 2016, he asked Tan to rent a car on his behalf. Tan, who is now 22, used the NRIC and driving licence to rent a car from a rental company called Rent My Car.

Wijaya asked for his client to be sent to a reformative training centre instead, and said that the prosecution's recommended sentence would have \"a crushing effect\" on Ong, the youngest of three children. \"Being a minor, at 17, I don't think he thought that the car (was an) unstoppable lethal weapon,\" said Mr Wijaya. \"I think he can be rehabilitated.\" He added that Ong, who has served a year of National Service, was \"an excellent and motivated soldier\". He said in his mitigation plea that \"there is no doubt that this tragic episode will haunt the accused forever\", and asked the court to \"temper justice with mercy\".

This follows a record year in 2017, which was the first year the industry crossed the S$4 billion dollar mark in total weighted new business premiums. Speaking to the media, President of the Life Insurance Association (LIA) Singapore Mr Patrick Teow said, “This year’s midpoint is already much higher than last year’s midpoint, so if momentum continues, we will cross $4 billion for sure.” The LIA announced the industry results on Monday (13 Aug). Compared to a year ago, the year-to-date total sum assured, which includes individual life and health insurance rose 19 per cent to S$66.3 billion in June 2018 from S$55.9 billion in June 2017, pointing to an increase in protection. “We are happy that protection for people is increasing and that tells us that people are taking a serious look at their financial health,” said Mr Teow. According to the association, there has been a slight shift in customers’ interest away from participating products, to both non-participating products and investment-linked products, attributed to insurers’ new product launches as well as improving economic conditions. “If everything stays stable and balanced, I think Singaporean’s momentum of satisfying their protection needs as well as their retirement needs will continue,” said Mr Teow. Even with the robust performance, he noted that there are challenges ahead. “We are still optimistically cautious that this momentum will continue to run through, but we are not isolated from what is happening in the market right now, with the trade war and how it will pan out.” Key actions for the industry to help individuals enhance the adequacy of their insurance protection will be released alongside a qualitative protection study later this year. Findings from the qualitative study aim to better inform the industry on the challenges faced by consumers and how LIA can address the concerns. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/life-insurance-industry-new-premiums-grow-20-in-first-half-of-10612388"}, {"datetime": "13 Aug 2018 02:51PM", "tags": ["Food delivery", "Fastbee"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Amid stiff competition, hawker food delivery start-up Fastbee to end operations on Aug 14", "content": " SINGAPORE: Hawker food delivery service Fastbee will have its last day of operations on Tuesday (Aug 14) after having to fend off stiffening competition in the local market on the back of difficulties in attracting fresh funding, founder Khoo Kar Kiat told Channel NewsAsia. Part of the new crop of delivering start-ups that emerged last year with a focus on local offerings, Fastbee allowed people to make lunch orders via its app and later pick up their food from designated vending machines at various industrial and business parks in the West.  Unlike most food delivery companies, it does not take a cut from orders or have a minimum order requirement, and relies on a S$1.50 delivery fee as its main income. At its peak, Fastbee had a footprint of 10 vending machines while delivering 10,000 packets per quarter from a team of just seven delivery men. While it relied on aggregating orders and eliminating point-to-point deliveries to stay lean and keep costs down, the start-up required economies of scale to turn profitable, Mr Khoo said on Monday. It began actively seeking venture capital (VC) earlier this year and later on, widened its search to include traditional investors. But by April, it was running out of cash as talks with a potential investor dragged on, the 34-year-old said. The start-up proceeded to reduce its number of machines to six locations but time was running out.  “We were actively reaching out to VCs and angel investors to obtain funding in order to scale up. However, we do not at this point have sufficient resources to achieve the growth rate that such investors are looking at,” he said.  “Later on, we tried to explore other types of investors and pivoted our model to be even more economical but we were running out of time.”  In the meantime, competition in the food delivery market has continued to heat up with a host of new players, such as GrabFood and Plum, eager to garner a slice of the market. As the battle for food-delivery supremacy plays out, experts have said that smaller players may lose out.  Mr Khoo admitted that Fastbee did feel the heat from the competition given how it did not have a deep warchest that allowed it to dish out promo codes or roll out extensive marketing efforts.  “I still believe in the concept of using a vending machine but it turns out that to convince people to take up a new habit, it’s very tough. “We’ve had people coming to tell us that they like our concept but somehow without some incentives like a discount code, people will not download an app or make another purchase,” he told Channel NewsAsia.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/fastbee-close-hawker-food-delivery-10612424"}, {"datetime": "13 Aug 2018 02:09PM", "tags": ["currencies", "US dollar", "Singapore dollar", "foreign exchange", "finance", "Turkey"], "author": "", "title": "US dollar rises to 13-month high against Singdollar on Turkish crisis", "content": " SINGAPORE: The greenback rose to a 13-month high against the Singapore dollar on Monday (Aug 13), as a renewed rout in the Turkish lira sent investors scurrying for safety in the US dollar and other assets.

BBR by Alain Ducasse will be the acclaimed French chef’s first Mediterranean sharing and grill concept, and will be located at the hotel’s 122-year-old Bar & Billiard Room. Meanwhile, fellow French chef Pic will be making her Asian debut with La Dame de Pic. Located in the hotel’s dining room in the main building, it will feature one of the world’s top female chef’s culinary signatures that takes the cue from her birthplace in the Rhone Valley. Singaporean master chef Jereme Leung returns with his contemporary Chinese restaurant yi, which will be at the newly restored Raffles Arcade and will feature Cantonese classics as well as adaptations of ancient Chinese delicacies. “Continuing with our tradition and commitment of the highest level of friendly, engaging and anticipatory service, we are more than excited to introduce concepts with partner chefs, who have a reputation of operating successful venues around the world, while at the same time, creating culinary experiences that are new and distinct to Singapore,” said Christian Westbeld, General Manager, Raffles Hotel Singapore, in a media release. The 131-year-old hotel, which is currently undergoing restoration, is set to open during the first quarter of 2019. Aside from the three restaurants, another new dining concept will be Butcher’s Block, which will showcase high-end single sourced meats. Six other bars and restaurants will be making its return at Raffles Hotel, including the North Indian dining spot Tiffin Room; heritage bar Long Bar, with its iconic Singapore Sling cocktail; The Lobby; Writers Bar; Raffles Courtyard; and the newly renamed Ah Teng’s Cafe. “I could not dream of a better location than the landmark Raffles Hotel Singapore to bring the Ducasse restaurant experience for the first time to Singapore,” said Ducasse in the media release.

So as long as we focus on delivering the reliability, over time we should be able to regain (the public's) confidence,\" Mr Neo Kian Hong said in his first interview with the media since his appointment. Mr Neo was speaking on the sidelines of a visit to SMRT’s Bishan depot, where he was briefed on the new batch of C151C trains. SMRT has been at the heart of several high-profile incidents in recent times, including a train collision at Joo Koon MRT station last November and a flooded MRT tunnel in October.   Mr Neo said he has set out three goals for the company - providing reliability, creating sustainability and ensuring continuous improvement. He described reliability of services as a “basic requirement” that the transport operator will need to provide under his leadership. “As a trains company, we will be focused on delivering safe and reliable train services,” he said.   GIVING UP HIS CAR Mr Neo also told reporters that he has given up his car and will rely on public transport. “I sold my car earlier on but I didn’t want to buy a new car, because it is more useful for me to take the MRT to understand the issues and take our company’s assets like our taxis and buses,” he explained. He also revealed that his family moved to a new home because of his new role. “It’s because of this job. I moved near Shunfu just to make sure I can take the trains to work and it's easier for me and my family can support me in doing this,” he added.  Mr Neo replaced former CEO Desmond Kuek, who spent five-and-a-half years heading the transport company.  \"CONFIDENT HE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE\": SMRT CHAIRMAN During his visit to Bishan depot, Mr Neo was accompanied by SMRT chairman Seah Moon Ming, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and Land Transport Authority (LTA) deputy chief executive for infrastructure and development Chua Chong Kheng.  Mr Seah said that Mr Neo understood the mission of the company, and is an individual who sees his role as a “duty” to the company and the public. “I am confident that he will make a difference to SMRT,” said Mr Seah. “He is competent to lead and run large organisations well. Over the last two months during the leadership transition, he has worked the ground and understands the ground challenges.” SMRT has had to defend its appointment of Mr Neo even before he officially took over the reins, with SMRT spokesperson Margaret Teo citing Mr Neo's \"personal values\" and \"leadership qualities\" as key reasons for his appointment.  Ms Teo's comments were in response to a Straits Times forum letter, in which its author Dr Michael Loh Toon Seng said that he was \"disappointed\" that SMRT had chosen \"another chief executive\" without \"relevant experience\". However, Mr Neo said that he has received positive feedback since his appointment was announced. “The public has been very supportive,” he said. “Many have come to me and expressed a lot of support. They have also expressed that they are very proud of the rail and that they want us to continue to improve it.” MEETING COMMUTER DEMAND To meet commuter demand, six new trains will be added to the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) next month, with another six to be introduced in early 2019, Mr Neo said. These 12 trains will be the first in Singapore to have \"tip-up seats\" to create more standing space for commuters during peak hours.  They will have four sets of three tip-up seats located in the centre of each car. The seats will be folded during morning and evening peak periods, and unfolded during off-peak hours to increase seating capacity. This can only be done by the train driver. The trains, which will also carry LTA's logo for the first time, will have red and green stripes - the colours of the NSEWL - against a white background. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-new-ceo-neo-kian-hong-give-up-car-win-public-trust-10612024"}, {"datetime": "13 Aug 2018 11:25AM", "tags": ["Housing and Development Board", "dogs"], "author": "", "title": "HDB flat dwellers allowed to adopt retired sniffer dogs under pilot programme", "content": " SINGAPORE: Starting Wednesday (Aug 15), members of the public who live in public housing will be allowed to adopt retired sniffer dogs under a one-year pilot expansion of Project ADORE. Project ADORE was launched in 2012 to assess how well mixed-breed dogs would be accepted in Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates, with proper safeguards in place. The scheme was expanded on a pilot basis in June last year to allow dog handlers from the Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force K-9 units and the SAF Military Working Dog Unit (MWDU) living in HDB flats to adopt the dogs. Fourteen sniffer dogs have been rehomed under this scheme, which will be made permanent from Aug 15, said the Home Affairs, Defence and National Development ministries in a press release on Monday. In order to widen the pool of potential adopters, the scheme will be expanded to members of the public staying in HDB flats on a one-year trial basis. Similar to the scheme for K-9 and MWDU officers, potential adopters will be screened. Steps will be taken to encourage community acceptance of the dogs, such as setting up mediation channels to handle disputes. The dogs will also be microchipped to prevent abandonment.  All adopters will be required to comply with the ownership conditions and the Code of Responsible Behaviour as set out by the Ministry of National Development. \"Observations have shown that residents have been receptive to the presence of larger dog breeds in their neighbourhoods as long as the owners behaved responsibly and if there were proper channels in place for dispute mediation,\" the press release said, adding that Project ADORE has been well-received so far.

This comes after a 1.1 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Non-electronic exports expanded by 16.6 per cent, extending a 4.6 per cent growth in the first quarter. The largest contributors to the increase in non-electronic exports were food preparations, civil engineering equipment parts and pharmaceuticals. Electronic shipments, meanwhile, fell by 7.6 per cent following a 7.9 decrease in the first quarter, Enterprise Singapore said. ICs, parts of PCs, and diodes and transistors declined by 11.3 per cent, 36.3 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, and they contributed the most to the decrease in electronic shipments. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, NODX grew by 7 per cent after the 2.6 per cent decline in the first quarter of the year.

This comes amid expectations of a growth slowdown in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, such as the US, Eurozone and China.  At the same time, uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy have increased, said MTI.  For one, recent tariff measures from the US have led to retaliatory moves from China, the European Union and several of its key trading partners. There is a risk of further escalation that could lead to a “vicious cycle of tit-for-tat measures” between the US and other major economies, said MTI.  “Should this happen, there could be a sharp fall in global business and consumer confidence, and in turn, investment and consumption spending. This could then have an adverse impact on global trade flows and global growth.” Meanwhile, against the backdrop of generally tightening global financial conditions, an upside surprise in inflation could lead to a faster-than-expected normalisation of US monetary policy, the ministry said.  This could trigger “disorderly capital outflows” from emerging markets in the region, causing financial vulnerabilities in these economies to surface, particularly for those with elevated debt levels.  Some pullback in investment and consumption growth, with spillover effects on the rest of the region, will happen as a result, MTI added.  Domestically, the Singapore economy will continue to be supported primarily by outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing, finance and insurance, wholesale trade as well as transportation and storage, which are expected to remain on an expansionary path.  The underperforming construction sector should see a bottoming out towards the end of the year despite recently announced property curbs, said MTI’s economics division director Yong Yik Wei.  This is largely due to support from public sector projects, which form between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the construction projects coming on stream, Ms Yong explained during the ministry’s quarterly briefing.  Officials also said that the latest housing curbs are unlikely to dampen the broader economy, except for “some slight impact” on the real estate segment which accounts for just 4 per cent of total GDP.  Meanwhile, data from Enterprise Singapore showed Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports (NODX) climbed 9.4 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, while trade expanded 10.2 per cent.  The Government’s 2018 growth forecast for NODX was adjusted to between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent, from 1 to 3 per cent. Full-year projection for total trade was also revised upwards to a range of 5 per cent to 6 per cent.

Cape Town, one of Africa's most affluent metropolises, was on the brink of disaster when it rapidly approached “Day Zero” – a moment when dam levels would be so low that taps would be turned off, and people must start queuing for water. While the city narrowly missed “Day Zero” as predictions pushed the day to 2019, the rest of the world watched closely, reminded that water scarcity is an ever-present threat for all nations. In Asia, the threat is more present than ever – water demand is forecasted to increase by 55 per cent by 2050, as population also increase. A recent study by MIT found an additional 200 million people across Asia would be vulnerable to severe water shortages by 2050. Worsening climate conditions such as droughts further dwindle our limited water resources. The problem varies from country to country: Myanmar loses some 100 million gallons of water daily in the supply process due to theft, metering inaccuracies or leaks caused by wear and tear in pipes from high water pressure conditions. In Malaysia, high water pressure in ageing pipes results in pipe bursts, causing frequent water supply shortages that affect both citizens and businesses. In spite of the water agreement with Malaysia expiring in 2061, Singapore’s water future looks reasonably secure thanks to NEWater and desalinated water through reverse osmosis. Sustaining water supply, however, could become an energy-intensive affair. Reverse osmosis uses about 3.5 kilowatt hours to produce 1 cubic metre of desalinated water. Singapore uses about 430 million gallons a day, out of which up to 30 per cent are desalinated. This translates to at least 1.68 gigawatt hours of energy a day, equivalent to powering more than 5,000 three-room Housing Development Board flats for more than a month. Despite national and regional cooperation to tackle water issues, progress is not coming fast enough as Asia’s water woes worsen. To truly tackle water scarcity in the region, countries need to take a step back and rethink the different aspects of water management. Governments, industries and consumers need to consider new perspectives to improve current practices to meet our water needs. REDEFINE THE WATER CYCLE  Technology has allowed us to reconsider man’s relationship with the water system, which has traditionally been a one-way process, moving water from supply to demand. Now, new digital innovations are able turn this relationship into a dialogue – by retrieving feedback throughout the process – and providing new ways to long-standing issues when it comes to water security. Real-time sensors and data analytics are increasingly used in Singapore and the region to conduct pre-emptive and predictive maintenance of the entire system. Intelligent technology can also predict changes in demand, and proactively adjust water pressures to prevent excessive stress on pipes. Notably, new technology has been able to address a seemingly simple but serious issue: Water leakage, which is a prevailing problem in many cities. For example, an intelligent water management pumping solution can automatically adjust water flow through the use of remote sensors, reducing excessive pressure in water pipes. This limits water leakages and losses, minimising cost and energy. On the demand side, consumers must reconsider our position in the water cycle, and take on a more active role. Data can help increase public awareness of water issues and strengthen conservation efforts. The hope is that knowledge will change our behaviour. One study by Singapore’s national water agency, PUB, and the National University of Singapore found that a person could save up to 5 litres of water a day using smart shower devices.  The Singapore Government will be deploying these devices over the next two years in new homes under a demonstration project with the Housing Development Board. BREAK INTO NEW WAYS OF FINANCING  While digitalisation holds vast potential for water conservation, success in addressing global water challenges requires us to not only look at innovation through technology, but also partnerships. A key barrier across the region to adopting new technologies has been financing, especially for developing countries. Most are unable to afford the burden of these huge infrastructure costs, while some see new innovations as an expense rather than an investment. Governments can look beyond traditional avenues of water financing, and expand into alternative approaches, such as forward-looking business models, new funding strategies, and new collaborative partnerships. India, for example, has turned to public-private partnerships (PPPs) to provide much needed funding and investment for numerous projects – such as when the World Bank assisted the Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project in 2011. PPPs allow the private sector to contribute in terms of the design, construction or operations of facilities, while tapping into public funding. The partnership can be useful in situations where countries lack the political will to apply cost-recovery tariffs. Developing countries can also look to institutions that have expressed long-term interest in backing water infrastructure development for the region. Earlier this year, the Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with the Myanmar government to provide aid of up to US$22 million to enhance the water supply systems in Mandalay with the installation of new pipes, wells, tanks, pumps and water meters. A new approach that encourages the adoption of new technology is exploring new business models. Water solutions providers can opt to be flexible in receiving payments in instalments, or innovatively channel efficiency savings made by customers into part of the payment scheme. In Cambodia, some private water operators have started opting to pay for their pump system through annual instalments, which are financed by the money saved on energy and water bills as a result of equipment upgrade. Not only would this remove barriers in terms of the usual upfront investment, it also allows solution providers to demonstrate the confidence they have in their products’ ability to “pay back” the amount. THE FUTURE OF WATER MANAGEMENT  Water management is one of the biggest socio-economic-ecological issues of the 21st century. We can no longer look at traditional practices to address contemporary water challenges.

It is easy to assume the Ministry of Health will be leading the charge in this war, for they hold the mandate on health promotion and screening, as well as on the management of diabetes and its complications. However, there is a good reason why Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced during the last National Day Rally speech that the whole country needs to come together if we are to win this war. Many people do not realise that health problems are often the leading indicators that something upstream is very wrong – whether it is our lifestyle and habits, or whether it is the environment that we are exposed to. For example, chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure require years of exposure to a lifestyle of imbalanced nutrition with low levels of physical activity. A mass outbreak of dysentery points to a poorly managed and unclean food and water system. The rampant spread of malaria or dengue infections suggest a gap in vector control policies to curb mosquito breeding. When it comes to promoting and maintaining health, the discourse has often been split between the role of government versus that of individual responsibility. Governments that play an enthusiastic role in protecting the health of citizens with legislation, be it around tobacco or sugar, are often criticised for curbing civil liberties. But at the same time, will ordinary citizens make the right choices if they are left to their own devices? CONSUMPTION CHOICES A RESULT OF CAMPAIGNS What many do not realise, is that what we perceive as our own choices, are often the results of carefully studied, researched and engineered campaigns by people who design the living environment around us. Take for example the food environment planned by retailers and manufacturers. There is a wealth of literature discussing the psychology of the average consumer in a supermarket, and products are researched and strategically placed with the specific intent to maximise sales. Many countries have laws on advertising bans and curfews of unhealthy food products high in sugar, fat and salt. Yet, we allow supermarkets to subconsciously and insidiously influence our shopping patterns by strategically placing these products at eye level, end of aisles, or next to the check-out counters, often with eye-catching promotional discounts aimed at maximising sales. The food and beverage (F&B) industry conduct multiple tests with panels of remunerated subjects in order to identify the “sweet spot” in taste and colour – the perfect combination of sugar, salt and other ingredients that maximises acceptance and desire, and correspondingly consumption and sales. The implicit incentives with the “up-size” mentality, where portion sizes are increased for a disproportionately small increase in price, also serve to seduce one into consuming beyond typical dietary requirements.  This is why the battle against the excessive consumption of nutrient-poor, high-caloric food cannot overlook the role retailers and the F&B industry play. Regulation is one way to compel these industry players to behave more responsibly, but another approach is to engage the same marketing and food science experts to design healthy yet tasty versions of mass-consumed food items such as noodles and rice – exactly the approach adopted by Singapore’s Health Promotion Board. LIFESTYLE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES SHAPED BY ENVIRONMENT Often, the environment provides opportunities and constraints that encourage and incentivise particular behaviours. Studies of product placement in vending machines have shown that people tend to choose healthier options or even water, when informed of the amount of sugar and calories present in the available choices. And yet, the opposite appears to be true as well. It was recently reported that when restaurants charge for plain water, consumers are nudged towards purchasing sweetened beverages. Think also about fast-food restaurants where changing the bundled soft drinks to bottled water incurs an additional surcharge. It is not solely the food environment that we are up against. Modern architectural and urban planning designs have resulted in a physical environment that promotes accessibility and convenience, which in turn has reduced incidental physical activity. The more interconnected our transportation networks are, the lesser we walk and stair-climb between the home and the workplace. It is ironic that these days we need new-fangled appliances such as physical activity trackers and mobile phone applications to remind and nudge us to do something basic such as walking and stair-climbing. WHY ARCHITECTS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS MUST BE INVOLVED The design of the urban environment also exerts a powerful influence over the amount of physical activity engaged by the masses in a daily manner. Do the stairwells in buildings encourage the inhabitants to take the stairs, especially when moving between consecutive levels? Are the walkways between transportation hubs to residential estates sufficiently broad, covered and airy to promote walking? Are the park connector networks extensive and connected enough to encourage part of the workforce to cycle to their workplaces? In fact, the World Health Organisation launched the Healthy Cities Movement in the 1980s to explicitly recognise the importance of urban planning, where developing the built environment landscape through the placements of transportation hubs, food centres and recreation zones, collectively have a sustained impact to promote health-seeking behaviors.  Environmental nudges may be subtle, but they are also ubiquitous and enable persistent modifications to our lifestyles. The F&B industry has been quick to capitalise on the covert role that psychologists, sociologists and marketing consultants play in influencing spending patterns. At the same time, urban planners and architects are beginning to realise the impact their designs have on human health. It is time that these multi-disciplinary experts are properly recognised and reminded of their roles in encouraging health-seeking behaviours. After all, while physicians may hold the key to treating people with diabetes, the key to preventing diabetes in the first place may just lie with social scientists and architects.

A heartbeat later, he pauses, studies his handiwork and stops the needle. The stitches are inlaid perfectly. For over 40 years, Mr Chan Huen Meng has worked tirelessly in his tailor shop, Meng Yee Alteration. “I usually work for seven days a week, and it gets busier around the holidays due to the festivities. Sometimes in the weeks before prom nights, we get many orders too,” he said. Once his hands are off the sewing machine, the slight tremors are immediately noticeable. While the onset of Parkinson’s disease is hastening his retirement, Mr Chan has groomed an apprentice to take over his business. \"My kids have received education and pursued careers in other industries so I won’t ask them to take over my business. Actually, this industry is tough, because the hours are long and the money is little. You don't get holidays as a boss so you need to work from day to night,” he explained. He became a tailor’s apprentice at 13, before diving into his first venture in East Coast, at 23. “But business failed, because I was inexperienced and rushed into it without a proper plan,” he said. “It was a small shop with a small capital. But I picked myself up after that and tried again. You need buyers and a good skill, but my skills weren't that good last time, so I failed.”  Since then, Mr Chan has had shops in Lucky Plaza, specialising in customised western suits, and then in Far East Plaza. It was in his present location that he found himself taking on more alteration requests. His daughter Chan Wai Yeng explained that this was partly due to the rise of e-commerce. “Making your own clothes went out of fashion in the 90s, when there were many clothes you could buy off the rack cheaply. My father recognised that it was not a business he could continue, but he also realised that there was a significant number of customers who wanted altering of their clothes. And because of that he slowly pivoted to that business,” she said. Ms Chan added that as more consumers use online shopping portals, business has picked up. “People were buying clothes online without even trying. When there are good sales, they just want to get the item and see if they can fit it through an alteration shop,” she said. While this seems to resonate across the old-school tailor enclaves, there are still customers who appreciate the value of artisanal tailoring skills. Tailors in Tekka Market say made-to-measure orders still make up a significant portion of their sales. Ms Komathy Muthiah is a seamstress who has been in the trade for nearly 20 years. She works about 12 hours daily at her shop, Three Stars Fashion Design, and even more so during festive seasons like Hari Raya and Deepavali. “Customers may make appointments, but sometimes their orders will be delayed because the workload is shared between one other person and me. I’m just thankful that they are understanding.” And busy she was. Even during the interview, Ms Komathy’s hands were full; briefly stopping to take measurements, or to close a sale. She added that as most of her customers are regulars, she is open to discussing designs with them.  “A lot of customers, even with the option of retail, they are not satisfied. They do come back to me, because they have their own ideas of how their dress should look.” This also means that Ms Komathy has to keep up with fashion trends. She says that designs from the 90s are making a comeback – such as boat neck collars and bare back blouses. Her hours may be long, but seeing her designs come alive makes it all worth it. A simple sari blouse starts at $35, and one with more intricate embellishments or finishing can go up to $100. Ms Komathy started as a home tailor after quitting her job in a factory. Like Mr Chan, she did not have an easy start, but her perseverance eventually paid off. “I first started a small shop in Teck Whye, but I struggled so much because I didn’t have the manpower to meet all my orders, since I was shouldering the business alone.” The single mother then took her business home, and began sewing clothes for her family and friends, before slowly building up enough capital to start her shop at Tekka Market. A needle and thread can go a long way; and these tailors have stitched their way into businesses to feed their family and their passion. “It is very hard work - you see everybody has a skill in them right?” Ms Komathy said, pointing at a green and gold baju kurong that she had just sewn. “So my skill lies in my hands. I love to do something different. I don’t just do stitching. I also do knitting, crocheting, also beads-work. Something creative. I love to do this, it’s in me.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tailors-thread-through-singapore-s-evolving-market-trends-10602924"}, {"datetime": "12 Aug 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Team Singapore"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Aiming for the stars: Team Singapore’s first ever paraglider eyes a medal at Asian Games", "content": " SINGAPORE: On top of leaping off a ridge with about 20kg of equipment, Jessica Goh has to manoeuvre from a height of 400 metres and attempt to land precisely on a coin-sized yellow spot on the ground. In attempting to do that, she runs the risk of being blown off course or twisting her ankle if she lands awkwardly. But Goh, a professional paraglider, takes these hazards in her stride as she goes about her daily training routine. “I’d like to correct the misperception that paragliding is a hazardous sport,” she told Channel NewsAsia in a phone interview on Monday (Aug 6). “It’s true that a small error could result in large and drastic consequences. But we pilots emphasise a lot on risk management and safety in flight,” added the 39-year-old. Instead of being overwhelmed by the dangers, Goh who took up paragliding professionally in 2012 after leaving her job as an executive with a firm in Singapore, focuses on what she loves of the sport. “(I love) the feeling of peace when I’m out there. It’s really quiet and the rolling hills and clouds are just beautiful. It’s quite something to be floating in the sky,” said Goh.   Goh is set to make history at the 2018 Asian Games by becoming the first Singaporean to compete in a major international tournament in the sport of paragliding. She will be competing in two categories – cross country and accuracy. Accuracy, which tests a pilot’s landing precision, is Goh's pet event. She will aim to touch down on a bull’s eye 2cm in diameter in a landing area marked by concentric circles at distances of 0.5 metres, 2.5 metres and five metres. An electronic pressure sensitive landing pad registers her first point of contact. How well she scores depends on where she lands in relation to the dead centre, the bull's eye. Goh hit the bull's eye earlier this year, achieving a perfect score at the Chung Buk paragliding union president open cup in Danyang, South Korea. For the cross country event, Goh will have to manoeuvre a course determined by the race director in the fastest time possible. Commenting on her chances of a podium finish in either event, Goh acknowledges that she faces stiff competition from Indonesian and Thai pilots. Regardless, she remains quietly confident. “I want to give my best for the country, and hopefully my best is a medal at the Asian Games,” said Goh. “I feel very honoured to be able to represent my country in paragliding at the major level Games, and with it comes the responsibility to highlight to other Singaporeans what the sport really is about,” she added. CHALLENGING PERCEPTIONS FROM HOME  One of Goh’s main motivations at the upcoming Asian Games is to boost the sport's profile in Singapore where, according to her, paragliding often gets mistaken for parasailing or skydiving.  Goh is based in Ranau, a mountainous region in Sabah conducive for the sport. Paragliding is not allowed in Singapore due to airspace restrictions and the lack of mountains and hills. But she said there are members of the Paragliders Association Singapore who use open public spaces in Singapore on weekends to practice ground handling, an essential training component. According to Goh, some Singaporeans react strangely when they see these paragliding enthusiasts practicing in public areas.  “Not many people understand this sport. So, when (the association) do it, they get a lot of weird stares, many questions, and some ask whether they are even allowed to do this,” she said. “So when I can go for a competition like the Asian Games, I hope it will bring recognition to the sport. “Hopefully, this will allow our paragliders to work closely with the land and aviation authorities to set aside a proper area to practice ground handling, so they can be safer pilots when they go overseas to fly,” Goh added. She acknowledged that the possibility of Singapore becoming a major paragliding hub is slim due to a lack of natural terrain, but maintains that the popularity of the sport will pick up if the authorities lend their support. “If I achieve my personal goal of a medal finish, I hope to elevate the status of this sport, and hopefully push it to Olympic level in the future. “I’d love to expose more Singaporeans to the sport. They can either join us to be paragliders to enjoy the sport or do tandem paragliding (with a pilot). I love it and I enjoy the sport tremendously. They will too,” she said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/team-singapore-first-paraglider-asian-games-jessica-goh-10596878"}, {"datetime": "12 Aug 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["cyberhacking", "cyber security", "SingHealth", "data"], "author": "Alan Chong", "title": "Commentary: The SingHealth breach and the uphill task of governing cyberspace", "content": " SINGAPORE: In the wake of the SingHealth data breach, it behoves both computer users and citizens to remember that cyberspace was originally intended to be the information superhighway for all. It was deliberately designed to be omnidirectional in communication. Everyone who is on the Internet should ideally be able to reach everyone else. Underpinning this design for accessibility lay large assumptions about gentlemanly conduct, humaneness, and transparency in reciprocal contact. As it has evolved, cyberspace also affords criminal elements a global presence. Governments too, reacted understandably to impose \"offline law\" on cyberspace in the name of protecting their citizens from harm arising from the misuse of information. Theft of personal information, the stealing of identities, hate propaganda, financial fraud and abuse of others’ reputations quickly abounded as the darker side of the information superhighway. In the course of policing against these harms, certain governments creatively inverted these malpractices as tools for cross-border penetration to pursue their respective national interests. It is therefore no surprise that when Minister for Communications and Information, S Iswaran, declared that even though Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA) could identify the \"Advanced Persistent Threat\" group that hacked SingHealth, he could not publicly name the perpetrators. This legal conundrum is also a political one: Government-backed hackers operate in the shadows for good reason, and information in the digital age commands an incalculable price. TRIALS OF STRENGTH BY STEALTH Insights from academics that study the security implications of cyberspace signal that anonymity, long distance penetration, remote control exercised through information technology, and above all, the quality of stealth add up to a new international order in cyberspace. This order operates in parallel to what we understand of visible international relations conducted openly in full glare of the world’s press and social media. In open diplomatic relations, even in overt military intervention, attribution and blame are visible and legally actionable. In cyberspace, the ability to extend communication globally overrides most legal restraints in daily use even if national rules are in place. Moreover, as the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency has declared, the whole idea of the Internet was meant to be an infinitely replicable and survivable communications network. Even China’s mighty censors have occasionally admitted that cyberattacks inside China cannot be completely prevented and foreign agencies can still attempt to hijack legitimate user addresses to penetrate China’s “sanitised” Internet. As strategist Chris Demchak has argued, the cyber dimension of international order pits “wars of disruption” against “wars of resilience”. In relation to the SingHealth incident, we can probably guard against a repeat of the last form of hacking with the benefit of hindsight but we have to be mentally prepared for newer, exotic forms of hack methods, by bouncing back to normality as quickly as possible. SHOULD CYBER HACKERS BE NAMED? The question of whether to name or not to name the cyber hackers revolves around one’s estimation of the severity of damage to national security and the reliability of cyber forensics in being 100 per cent confident in identifying the perpetrator. The two issues may even overlap. During the suspected Russian-sponsored cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007, the damage had amounted to an assault on both the Estonian banking industry and its entire government. The damage could even be assessed in millions of dollars. Yet the confirmation of Russian official culpability was never fool-proof. Smaller airports in the UK and the US have also been systematically disrupted by viruses sent from abroad to mangle passenger booking software. North Korea too has only been heavily suspected of sanctioning disruptions of Sony’s Playstation and interference against South Korean banking operations. In all of these cases, culpability could not be guaranteed to hold up in any court of law.  In the Middle East, several pairs of longstanding rival states have also taken to cyberspace to conduct tit-for-tat operations with little impact on the main offline political divides. This slew of precedents suggests that the red line of \"catastrophic damage\" arising from a cyberattack remains mostly in the realm of intelligent projection, with the exception of Estonia’s experience in 2007. Moreover, most sophisticated hackers have found ways and means to mask their complete identities such that even the best forensic teams will have to surmount a high threshold of proof before producing an indubitable charge. RISKY TO NAME PERPETRATOR To name a perpetrator in the absence of incontrovertible proof and catastrophic damage may risk upsetting existing diplomatic relations, sour the bilateral economic climate, or worse, initiate a conventional war which both sides do not want. In the meantime, cyber hacking of the state-sponsored variety is here to stay. For some it may be the ultimate form of power politics exercised in the shadows, displacing the confidence of a target population and its government, without direct political exposure. For Singaporeans, the practical lesson is that digital hygiene is the shared responsibility of government, citizens and private sector. Practical steps can mean changing personal passwords frequently and scanning access points for unusual patterns of activity. The solution cannot be simply a case of applying more information technology complexity to guard information technology.

During a week when Singaporeans are celebrating National Day, he is doing a series of interviews publicising his upcoming film Republic of Food, in which food is one of the defining elements of the Singaporean identity. The 46-year-old’s slight physique belies his accomplishments as a filmmaker. Before we discuss the larger issues associated with his work, he explains how his interest in theatre and film making began in his secondary school days.  But in university, he studied law. “There weren’t any film-related courses then and I wasn’t ready to go abroad. So I did what a lot of my peers in the creative line did. We studied law, because we were all humanities students,” he says. After a short stint at a law firm, his love for writing returned to haunt him and he took on a job as a film critic. This soon led to taking a leap to make a movie of his own. He made a short film, Moveable Feast, in 1996. His first feature film, was \"a motorcycle kung-fu love story\", titled Eating Air. To listen to the full interview, click here. More recently, he’s been known for making horror films such as The Maid, which broke box office records in 2005, making S$700,000 in its opening weekend. It also won the Asian Award at the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation.  In 2006, he embarked on a co-production entitled Love Story with Hong Kong’s Focus Films. Tong won the Best Director Award at the Singapore International Film Festival for the film. In 2014, he became the first Singaporean director to helm a Hollywood film when he started shooting The Faith of Anna Waters. As he sits down with me to talk about Republic of Food, delving into the deeper issues related to this film and his larger body of work seems inevitable. Throughout, he maintains his boyish charm and good-natured manner, even while describing the challenges of his career and discussing xenophobia and national identity in Singapore.  IDENTITY IS CEMENTED BY ADVERSITIES When I put it to him that it seems superficial to define ourselves only by our cuisine, he first begs to differ. “I think we have managed to capture the kind of power that food has over our memories, and between our past and the things we put in our mouth.” But he soon admits that there needs to be more to national identity. \"I think cultures need a very long gestation period. Being kiasu, kiasi. Are these meaningful? Maybe, in a caricature-ish way but I think to say our identity is such like the French or the Japanese, I think our story needs to unfold a lot more.” He adds that he feels national identities are “cemented by adversities”. “Our very first big look at ourselves in a cracked mirror was of course Japanese occupation, but back then, ours was a Malayan identity. And in fact, a lot of people didn’t feel Malayan, they felt like they were just here to work and after that they’ll go back to China, or they’ll go back to India. So if you look from 1965 onwards, I think we've had it very, very good. There were the race riots, there were moments of difficulty, but I think we need a longer road, we need a bumpier road, for what I think truly our national traits to emerge. I really do think it’s too early to tell.” However, he reiterates that food has “a certain universality” as depicted in Republic of Food. The movie, produced by Tong’s Boku Films and supported by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) stars Adrian Pang and Yeo Yann Yann as a couple living in a dystopia where a food-borne virus renders everyone's favourite dishes banned. It will be screened at selected Cathay cinemas from Aug 16. The inspiration for the film came to Mr Tong when he served as a mentor to film-makers on MCI's Project Lapis Sagu short film competition which was aimed at creating work that looked at cohesion between Singaporeans and immigrants and new citizens. When I ask if it might be perceived as Government propaganda, he says he thinks of it more as a collaboration.  \"Did they control the film? Did they censor the film? Did they tell me what to shoot and what not to shoot? No. I had carte blanche. As a filmmaker, I always have final cut.\" Amid celebrating food as identity, it explores our diverse multi-ethnic community from a refreshing perspective. XENOPHOBIA IN A CHANGING SINGAPORE “Adrian Pang’s character is part of this underground food club, which he doesn’t want anybody to know about. But the two foreigners he works with stumble onto that secret and they basically worm their way into that club. For a xenophobe like him, that’s the last straw. \"The film doesn't mean to point fingers and say xenophobia is a bad thing. It's actually a very understandable thing. But the film doesn't attempt to solve anything. It aims to open up the ground to look at some of these behaviours and get people thinking.\" For Mr Tong, the film is also meant to address the changing demographics of Singapore.  “I think the people going into the cinemas have changed. So you can't count on just good old Singaporeans going into cinemas anymore because the new citizen from China or India is part of this fabric now. So I was reflecting on this sort of change that I was feeling. “I think locals also forget that part of our identity includes the fact that we were all different when we came. If you look at Singapore circa 1870, 1890, boatloads of people were coming on a daily basis. In fact I think that transformation of Singapore was even more dramatic than what we’re seeing now. I think it is part of our identity to be open. We’ve always been an open society. In fact, ask economists and they’ll say that actually is the reason for our success.” Our lack of a firm identity, he believes, has also contributed to Singaporeans being harsher when judging local work and only really taking notice after the work has received accolades overseas. “Familiarity breeds a certain amount of contempt. Singaporeans will always be tough on Singaporeans and I'm used to it actually. I don't necessarily accept it, but I don't get angsty about it. “It’s because our identity is still in a state of flux. Don’t forget because we’re such an open society and so many of the products we use, including ingredients for food, are imported. Till our identity firms up, there will always be this instinctive feeling that our work can't be that good. It comes from insecurity. It can't be hurried. It will have to take many more local talents to make it for this to change perhaps.” GLAD HE NEVER WENT TO FILM SCHOOL Life as an aspiring filmmaker was not always easy and Tong has had his share of uncertainties. “I thought for the longest time, the closest I could get to cinema was to write about it and I was happy writing about it. It was about the third year of my time as a film critic that Jack Neo made Money No Enough. That film moved me a lot because not only did I see Singapore on the big screen, I heard Singapore on the big screen. And I think most importantly, it showed that you could make a Singapore film and not fall fully flat on your face.” At that point he applied to go to film school in the US and been accepted, but because the opportunity presented itself and he had some savings, he decided to make Eating Air instead. “That film effectively was my film school.That was how I learnt about the art.” In fact, he says he is glad he never went to formal film school. “This is going to sound terrible, but in the course of my work, I do meet a lot of young people and I meet a lot of young people who come from film schools. I generally find that film schools can ironically act as a set of blinders. I think film as a technique can be learnt. But I think if you look at film as a point of view, you might be better off spending the time driving a taxi or being a yoga instructor.  You might meet more people and get better stories. When in film school, you just read about films, you just learn about films. But it’s very myopic in that sense because a film can't be about other films.” I ask him which of his life experiences have informed his work. His parents who owned a little toy store had something to do with it. “They were essentially shop keepers, so they were really busy. And I think short of making sure that like we weren’t playing with heroin or knives at home, they pretty much left me and my siblings to do what we wanted. I went to Victoria School and in those days, in schools there was more diversity in terms of socio-economic mix.  For example, there was a boy whose father drove him to school in a big BMW, but next to you there is also a boy that tends to come late, because his dad drives a cab. So you had that kind of vibrancy.\" He credits his National Service stint as being instrumental in exposing him to people from different walks of life “whose stories have got that little ring of authenticity”. “My work comes from all these bits and pieces of Singapore that I know.” To him, film is simply about stories even though some have wondered whether there are political overtones in some of his work. For instance, does his latest dystopian comedy say something about the political establishment? “I'm not a political filmmaker. I don’t feel motivated to use cinema as a pulpit. I don’t see films as a sort of a broadcast system or a soapbox. I just don’t, I'm attracted to stories. I think it’s about the human condition. It’s about love, drama, relationships.”  FILMMAKERS IN SINGAPORE “HAVE IT VERY, VERY GOOD” Just like any other filmmaker, he admits that money is never enough, but over the years, he has managed to garner regional investors. His horror films were in a way designed to ensure survival.  “Horror films fit really tiny budgets. Nobody ever complains that horror films are too dark because the filmmakers couldn't afford lighting. There is also very, very little dialogue in horror films. So you won't annoy audiences with subtitles, especially if they watch it in a foreign land. And I think fear is something that is very, very basic so it is very easily translatable. This is positive for the business side of things and would allow me to survive and make more films.” But for him, film projects don't begin with monetary calculations. “The thought process is that there is this idea that I like, then I look at the genre, then we look at the kind of returns that this film is likely to make. If it is not as commercially viable, then we should find a way to write the script in such a clever way that we can make it for a lot less money. The money side comes later. It is an execution thing. It is not a decision thing. “I think if you look at someone like Eric Khoo, one of the things that I really, really admire about him is that he never makes a film for more than S$500,000. That’s an amount that even some kid just fresh out of film school would reject, but Eric Khoo does that consistently. So I don’t think budget per se makes a film industry or makes a film. I think the stories and the passion is equally important.” But he admits that money can be a determining factor in success and the lack of it could disadvantage Singaporean filmmakers. “You’re going up against the forces of very talented filmmaking entities. Hollywood has made this a science. If you look at something like Pixar. The kind of resources that they apply to crafting their stories, to creating that product, I don’t think it is realistic to take them on consistently. We don’t have the critical mass, we don’t have that kind of financial muscularity.” His own investors are varied. “Sometimes it will be either a distribution company that actually takes a stake in the film, or it could be say, be a talent agency. Instead of paying us the full amount for the cast, maybe they take equity. So, we try to find ways to collaborate in that sense.” While other filmmakers bemoan the lack of state funding, he feels differently. He mentions the Singapore Film Commission's support several times.    “I think we, filmmakers in Singapore have it very, very good already. I think if you go to a lot of other countries where people have amazing stories to tell, basically the government’s not interested in the film industry and the businessmen would rather like plough their money into property.” “CHURLISH” TO WANT STATE FUNDING, THEN COMPLAIN ABOUT IT As we talk more about state funding, he reveals that his view on recent instances of state funding being pulled from certain book projects because they challenged established narratives of history is “realistic”.  “If you really want to be independent of influence or censorship, then don’t take the funding. I think it’s churlish to want it, then complain about it.” However, I point out that artists who complain do so as a matter of principle. Shouldn’t taxpayers’ money be used to fund a variety of work rather than just work that supports the established narrative? “I'm not saying that censorship is desirable. But censorship is inevitable and it’s not unique to Singapore. Every society practices censorship, simply because I don’t think the freedom to express whatever view will actually lead to eventual happiness because there are a lot of conflicting views and some views can hurt. And I do think every society arrives at its own balance of what do we allow, what do we not allow. “Are the parameters too narrow? I'm not sure, and I’ll never be sure. But I think every time a work comes up and it causes a certain reaction, then we see where the parameter is drawn, and then it’s up to the arts community and even members at large to push back to weigh in with their opinions. You may not be able to push the parameter back this time round but simply through the views that people put forward in a rational way, I do think the powers that be enforce the parameters on our behalf. He believes it is a “conversation”, rather than a “pugilistic duel”. As Tong continues to make his mark in the world of film, and while he has several projects in the making including one on Singapore in the 1970s, most of all, he wants to have made a personal impact on his audience. “The ability to look at Singapore from different genres and try to tell those stories from different angles is important to me. I hope I've made them laugh, I hope I’ve scared them, made them cry. I hope I’ve done all that for audiences with a Singapore story.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/kelvin-tong-filmmaker-on-the-record-10606074"}, {"datetime": "12 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["poverty", "Thailand", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "The Singaporean grad who ditched his corporate dreams because of a glue-sniffer in Thailand", "content": " KHEK NOI, THAILAND: While volunteering in a village in northern Thailand, undergraduate Daryl Tay came across a boy who was high on glue and roaming the streets. Asked why he chose to sniff glue, the 15-year-old gave an answer that disturbed the Singaporean. “He told us, ‘If you had just 20 baht (S$0.82), would you use it to buy a bowl of noodles – it should keep you full for a few hours – or would you spend it on a bag of glue that would keep you full for days?’” recalled Mr Tay. “His reply shocked us to the core.” That experience opened his eyes to the complexity of poverty at the transit points of the drug trade between the Golden Triangle and Bangkok. In the village of Khek Noi, substance abuse is rampant among juveniles. “Some of us asked: Should we blame the poor for being in that condition?” said Mr Tay. “I believe, after hearing this boy’s reply, that we can’t blame them for the situation they’re in now. They were born into an unequal world.” From that encounter, he decided to dedicate his life to “making the world a more equal place for people like the boy”. After getting his economics degree from the Singapore Management University, Mr Tay joined Radion International, the relief and development agency he had volunteered with earlier, as a full-time staff member – one of its 14 staff now. Founded in Singapore, the Christian organisation’s activities in the 17,000-strong village of Khek Noi, where it has had a field office for 11 years, include a recovery shelter for at-risk children and programmes combating drug abuse and domestic violence. The 29-year-old’s mission in Thailand is featured in On The Red Dot's four-part National Day special, as celebrity chef Robin Ho tracks down Singaporeans working for social good in remote locations and harsh conditions. (Watch the episode here.) JUST A PHASE? Like many young Singaporeans, Mr Tay, who grew up in a middle-income family, had “ambitions to make it big”. His life had been mapped out: Work in corporate finance, climb the career ladder, get married, settle down and retire early. “But I think that’s taken second place to what I feel is my calling,” he said. His decision did not please his parents, who dismissed it as “just a phase” because “Daryl’s going to maybe spend a gap year in Thailand and he’ll be back – he’ll come to his senses”, he recalled. One year turned into four, and his father was the most upset initially, as he had wanted his son to flourish in the corporate world. Said Mr Tay: “In fact, things got a little bit tense in the family when I told him that I had made up my mind to go through this track that was unconventional.” So unconventional that he gets only a basic allowance for his living expenses, but no salary, from a church in Singapore. “I had this hope in my heart that one day they’d come up to see what we’re doing here – the good work that we’re doing for these children,” he said. To his surprise, they did, after two years. “The greatest takeaway from that trip was when my mother started to build a relationship with this young girl. And after that she asked me, ‘How can I help this young girl further?’” His parents are now the sponsors of two Thai children, and he is “very grateful” to them for having “moved from (being) unsupportive to giving so much towards this work”. LIKE A MORGUE? Mr Tay is now in charge of grants, collaborations and the recovery programme for children aged six to 12, which provides them with meals, opportunities in education and a safe environment conducive to rehabilitation. Today, the entire recovery programme has 40 children aged six to 17. WATCH: Saving children from poverty and drug abuse (Dur 3:25)  On an almost daily basis, he wakes up at 5am to help rouse the children in the shelter, getting them ready for breakfast, and sends them to school. His living quarters is a tiny but snug room shared with several children. They each have a capsule bed – Radion's idea for the bedrooms. Each capsule has power points, a light for reading and a ventilation fan, which also helps to keep out mosquitoes. “One of them came to us and said, ‘Wow, this is so exciting, but it looks a little bit like a mortuary.’ We were a bit taken aback,” he said, adding that most of the kids, however, were simply excited about the concept. In the evenings, he would fetch them from school, get them prepared for dinner and help them with their homework. On why he shares a room with the children, he explained that it “creates opportunities for building relationships”, where he can sit with a child and listen to his story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “Sometimes you have to intentionally create these moments. You have to put yourself out there,” he said. “Sometimes they won’t approach you, but you just have to make yourself available.” The children call him “Phi (pronounced ‘p’) Daryl\". “‘Phi’ in Thai means older or big brother, so it’s an affectionate term,” he said proudly. PLAIN RICE AND SALT When Mr Tay first arrived, however, he struggled with the language and the harsh environment. “Since I started working here, I’ve attended more funerals than birthday parties,” he said. “The crime rate is high. We see death every day. Last year, two children, not more than the age of six, drowned in the village river. These are the very real things that happen in the village, things you have to come to terms with. Poverty there, he felt, has created the most problems. Sometimes both parents must work in the fields, and since many struggle to put their children through school, the kids are often left to their own devices. Accidents and deaths then occur. Moreover, among impoverished families, meals are not a certainty. Sometimes two meals a day are a luxury. “A meal sometimes could just be plain rice and salt. And this is supposed to keep a family full for a few days,” said Mr Tay. “When I see some of the living standards these families have here, it teaches me not to take food for granted.” With limited choices, some of these families turn to drugs as a source of income, hence the rampant substance abuse. To break the poverty cycle and give the children “a shot at a brighter future”, the organisation provides them with a second chance to go to school, from Primary One to Secondary Six. To help finance its operation, every child is tagged to an overseas sponsor, like his parents, who support the child’s school fees, medical bills and living expenses. HOPE FOR THE CHILDREN For Mr Tay, the most rewarding part of his work is in witnessing the transformation of his wards. Some of them arrived at the shelter discouraged, but after rehabilitation and education, many have started to believe in themselves. Like nine-year-old Liza, who went to him with her results slip, proclaiming that she finally came first in her class. “I saw a very satisfied smile on her face. I’d never seen it before. That moment was very memorable to me because that was the moment she started to believe in herself again,” he beamed. “When a child believes in herself, suddenly nothing is impossible for her. She’d start dreaming of crazy futures that she wouldn’t have dared to dream before. But that’s the beginning of a brighter future.” And that is what the volunteers hope for all the children in their programme. When Mr Ho asked what his motivation was, Mr Tay replied that it was children like Liza, who will “never know the love of a father and may never know the love of a mother”. It’s the desire to tell children like her that there’s someone out there who still loves them. Impressed by what this young man has contributed to the village, Mr Ho cooked him a Singaporean meal: Teochew-style braised duck, which Mr Tay thought was roasted duck. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “He’s almost a Thai now … He doesn’t know his food any more,” said the chef, who told him with a laugh: “You’ve been away from Singapore for too long already.” Indeed, Mr Tay experiences a culture shock whenever he returns home. The warm showers, his comfortable bed and even having burgers make him feel “foreign”, he said. Having spent some of his best years helping the underprivileged in Thailand, he urged Singaporeans to have compassion for communities and people in need “because not all of them chose to be in these circumstances”. “Their strength amidst their difficulties is something I really respect,” he said. “That’s the reason we choose to help them – not because we pity them, not because we’re better than them, but because they’re fellow human beings.” Daryl Tay is one of four Singaporeans on a social mission abroad who feature in On The Red Dot.

Speaking at ITE College Central to a youth forum of about 300 students, Mr Shanmugam said that people can become radicalised more quickly, calling this a \"worrying\" development. \"The other thing that is worrying is, in the past, it took about two years for people to get radicalised,\" he said. \"But now, sometimes it is two months, three months.\" \"Sometimes, internationally, it has even been three to four days,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"That becomes very difficult for the security forces.\" In addition, the number of arrests being made in Singapore has been increasing, said the minister. \"If you take 2007 to 2014, that is eight years, we had 11 Singaporeans that we dealt with,\" he said. \"But if you look at 2015 to the present, three-and-a-half years, we have arrested or dealt with 20 in just three-and-a-half years.\" Of these 20 people, 18 were radicalised online, said the minister, adding that this showed \"how important it is to make sure your online space is okay\". The minister also warned against complacency in the fight against extremism. \"We have the situation relatively under control, but neither you nor I can say we have won,\" he said. \"We have to be on guard and we have to fight back.\" To this end, defending against extremism does not just fall to the Government, but youth have a part to play too, said Mr Shanmugam. \"Fighting back does not just mean the Government,\" he said. \"Fighting back essentially has to be you. You have to help in the fight back.\" Firstly, young people should go to established sources to learn about religion, said Mr Shanmugam. In addition, they can also \"help in the fight by going online positively\" with positive messages. Said the minister: \"You have to help, you have to teach your friends, you have to put out the positive messages of peace, universal brotherhood and sisterhood, friendship, living together and working together in a common space. That is extremely important.\" He also touched on the importance of respecting the \"common space\", given Singapore's multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society. \"We respect each other but make sure there is a space for all of us. Both the individual space to go out and pray as you wish, live your life but also a common space,\" he said. \"We can be Indian, Malay, Chinese, we can be Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim, Christian but there is another identity - we are Singaporeans,\" he added. \"If we do not mix with each other, that identity is gone.\" \"MORE WORRIED\" ABOUT AL-QAEDA, JI Touching on extremism around the world, Mr Shanmugam said that while attention has been focused on Islamic State, he was actually \"more worried\" about groups such as Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Al-Qaeda has been active around the world, including Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia, while JI is \"particularly active\" in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore, said the minister. \"While the attention has been focused on (Islamic State), Al-Qaeda and JI have been quietly gathering strength, regrouping, putting out their material, gathering recruits, gathering money for major attacks in due course,\" he said. \"Al-Qaeda today is said to be bigger, more people, more countries, than they ever were.

Contrary to popular belief, it’s also not motivation. In this day and age where careers are prioritised and society moves at a fast pace, the one thing we’re lacking is time – it’s leading to most of us missing out on dinners with friends and families. The lack of time is also making it hard for working adults to make new friends outside of their professional circles. In fact, the National Population and Talent Division’s marriage and parenthood survey results released last year found 39 per cent of singles choose to focus on their careers or studies rather than to seek out dates, much less form new friendships. By placing priority on matters other than making friends, their social circles and existing friendships are shrinking. Much has also been said about the difficulties in sustaining long-term friendships in modern day society. It’s so easy to get engrossed in technology, in social media and its bottomless feed and forget about those around us. Can we still make meaningful connections in a competitive, technology-dominated world? FRIEND FINDING Compared to our parents’ generation, technology has changed the texture of human relationships. Since the emergence of social apps, more are reaching out online as the primary way to expand their social circles. Singapore saw an increase in percentage of singles open to online dating from 19 per cent in 2012 to 43 per cent last year. While negative perceptions of friendship and dating apps will never fully go away, the long-term trend is that more individuals are connecting through online platforms. This interaction however might be bursts of activity rather than the long-term sustained friendships. On social networking app Paktor, users send at least 60 messages per log-in – likely, multiple messages to several profiles at once and with multiple matches. Perhaps convenience gives an illusion of choice. Some get complacent and believe if a friendship doesn’t work out, they can always move on to the next option and “ghost” the other party. Maybe this is the reason why friendships form fast but people run a high risk of drifting apart just as quickly. MAKING AND MAINTAINING CONNECTIONS Some may argue that friendships formed in school or in the army create deeper connections and last longer. People who experience hard times together are said to forge stronger bonds. One study, led by researcher Brock Bastian of the University of New South Wales in Australia, found that shared pain can produce bonding and cooperation. It also found that shared pain can increase a sense of solidarity, and boost cooperation among those who share these experiences. While this may be true, it does not mean that it is impossible to create meaningful connections with the people you meet online – whether you’re trying to make a friend or trying to form a romantic relationship. A study published in the MIT Technology review found that couples who met online had higher levels of compatibility. Another study published in the journal Sociological Science in 2017 found that couples who met online made a quicker transition to marriage compared to those who met offline.  The lesson isn’t that online dating will lead you to form meaningful friendships or find the one. But it is a way to meet others and try to see if there’s enough common ground for a long-term friendship, when time is not on your side. JUST KEEP AT IT For those trying to make new friends online, my own advice is to be clear of what you hope to achieve when you meet someone and to just keep at it. It’s always nerve-wrecking meeting someone for the first time but what do you have to lose? Think of it as meeting a friend’s friend for the first time. Get to know people, have polite conversations, and don’t put pressure on yourself. The key to maintaining new friendships is to constantly communicate and make it a point to meet regularly. Showing that you are putting in effort highlights how keen you are in maintaining the friendship which will hopefully be met with reciprocity. It sounds hard but if there is genuine chemistry and common interests, putting in the effort should come naturally. If it doesn’t, perhaps that also teaches you something about yourself, your interests and what matters to you in making a genuine connection with someone. At the end of the day, forming long-lasting friendships or relationships isn’t rocket science. It is up to you to put in the effort into maintaining them.

The passenger roll call was rudimentary at best – for a boat with a maximum capacity of 14, including two crew members. Satisfied, Vincent Chew settled into his worn leather seat and gunned the engine, with the ease of a man who has done this his entire life. But it’s only been seven years since Vincent took the helm. The former islander previously ran a provision shop on Pulau Ubin, and commuted weekly to the mainland to bring in his stock. “It takes years before you will really know how to handle a boat,” he confessed, explaining that most of the 33 other Pulau Ubin boatmen have decades of experience under their belts. Even so, he says the route is direct enough, come night or day. “This line? Even with my eyes closed, I know the direction. When a big ship comes at night, we need to see where the red and green lights are to know how wide the ship is,” Vincent said, explaining that the lights are navigational aids required for visibility in the dark. His boat, which is varnished in orange and grey, is distinct among the bobbing fleet at Changi Point Ferry Terminal, with a large fishing net slapped across the roof. “Sometimes when we drive in the middle of the sea, we can see wild boars swimming. Other times you can see big fishes. So I keep a fishing net on my boat. But depends on whether you're lucky or not,” he said. As someone who grew up on the shores of Pulau Ubin, amongst fishermen and boatmen, sailing came naturally to Vincent, even though he entered the profession late. But steering a boat takes more than keeping an eye out for choppy waves, it also means adapting to the elements. “Just imagine, every day the tide is different. The wind is different, so when you want to come alongside a jetty, you must see how the current runs and where the wind blows. If you don't know how to read the tide and the wind, big problem for you,” Vincent said. Kit Kau Chye, 70, is a veteran who has plied the waters for over 50 years. He is now the chairman of the Changi Point Ferry Association. The former islander has a wiry frame, and is quick on his feet, side-stepping over tangled mooring ropes to add his boat number to the growing row of digits on the makeshift board. The boatmen here take turns to ferry passengers across to the island, and the list serves as a queue of sorts. “Some come down as early as 4am, just to be first in line,” Mr Kit said, even though the passenger service officially starts at 6am. He’s been sailing ever since he picked up the trade at 18. “When the boat moves, we need to see how to park. Last time there was no proper structure, no teachers to guide us, we had to observe and learn by ourselves,” Mr Kit said.  “No choice, if you don't have much of an education then you have to pick up a skill, a trade, to live by. Last time when we were young, we were quite carefree - we plucked fruits, climbed trees - and the older folk criticized us and told us to learn something to survive,” he chuckled. Mr Kit had to commute daily to the mainland for classes. “Those of us who grew up in the 40s and 50s on Pulau Ubin, attended a primary school on the island. But once we graduated, we had to take a boat to the mainland, before taking a bus to secondary school. For those who live further away, they need to wake up at 5am to cycle to the docks or walk,” he said. Today, getting around the island is much faster, with a taxi service and bicycle rental shops at the entrance of the jetty. Island taxi driver Azman Hamid is among a handful to own a Pulau Ubin-registered van. Vehicles registered for island use are identified by PU on the license plate. “Last time when we started, there were around 17 vehicles, but now there's only nine left. So we just rotate automatically. No need for queue numbers anymore,” Mr Azman said. A round-island tour costs up to $35 an hour, while a short trip amounts to about $6. But the biggest payday for the drivers is when film productions take place on the island. The vans, Mr Azman revealed, would be booked on a long-term basis to ferry the crew to various locations. With no car repair shops on the island, these drivers have to do everything themselves – until they hit a particularly bad bump on the road. “If it's something minor like changing the engine oil, we will do it ourselves. There is also a friend who can do help with it. But when it comes to major things such as the replacement of the air-conditioning system, we have to bring in a mechanic from the mainland,” he explained. Bicycle shop owners like Koh Bee Choo echo the same sentiment. “If any bicycles are defective, we repair them ourselves. When you stay here, you need to do everything yourself. The carpentry job, the mechanical job, those electrical problems, we need to know them all. We must know how to take care of the property and the land here,” she said. Her shop is the first visitors see as they stroll towards the town square. Quirky signboards touting road safety are nailed into the wooden frames that prop up the shop’s exterior. Ms Koh was born on Pulau Ubin, and counts among the remaining few who still live on the island. “I moved to the mainland for a period. But the atmosphere is totally different. In the urban area, so many buildings are taller than the trees. On Pulau Ubin, the trees are taller than the houses,” she said.  “This has been my shop for the last 24 years, and my life for as long as I can remember. I know everyone here, so why should I leave?” The population on the island peaked around 2,000 in the 1970s, but it has since dwindled to just over 30 today. Yet the community continues to thrive, kept on their toes by some 300,000 visitors annually. “Life is good here, easy to earn money, not tough. When we have nothing to do, we will just chit chat. No need to be so stressed out working non-stop like you. We will walk around, rest and wait for our turn to drive the boat,” Mr Kit said.  His weather beaten hands are lined with callouses, from years of sailing. But for islanders like him, it's also a mark of a self-made person, and a promise – that no matter how the tides turn, their ties to the island will never fade.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/life-on-pulau-ubin-boatman-taxi-driver-bike-rental-10603004"}, {"datetime": "11 Aug 2018 06:17AM", "tags": ["Rahayu Mahzam", "special needs", "Down Syndrome"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Embracing the experience: MP Rahayu Mahzam on parenting a son with Down Syndrome", "content": " SINGAPORE: Juggling work and motherhood, says Rahayu Mahzam, is one of the biggest challenges she faces.

And she sent me a picture of him, and the whole time, he was looking at her like that,” she recounted, demonstrating a suspicious, side-eyed look. “She bathed him, fed him, gave him his milk, and the whole time, he was looking at her like that.” “When I came home, I was rewarded with a smack on my face,” she added, laughing. She is quick to emphasise that the issues she faces as a working mother are common to many other parents. But her journey is slightly different: It is one which involves perhaps a little more fear and worry, and a host of additional medical appointments.   Because Ayden, she revealed in an impassioned speech in Parliament last month, has Down Syndrome.   GOING PUBLIC Mdm Rahayu had never hidden Ayden’s condition from friends and family. But her speech, in which she spoke frankly about her personal experiences as a mother of a child with special needs and called for more to be done in the area of inclusive education, was the first time, she said, she was revealing Ayden’s condition on “such a public platform”. “I wanted to talk about the issue because I was aware of some of the things that other parents were facing, but it wasn’t just about me,” she said. “And also, I was very conscious about labelling him, because he’s so young, and doesn’t have a say in how he’s put up. \"People might also see him a certain way after that.” But despite her concerns, she went ahead with the speech, as she felt the points she was making were important, and would resonate with many other parents of children with special needs. Some, she said, reached out to her after she made the speech. “The stories, feelings and emotions ... I just wanted to send that message. And generally people appreciated that I captured that emotion.” TERMINATION WAS NEVER AN OPTION Doctors first raised the possibility that Ayden had Down Syndrome when Mdm Rahayu was about five months’ pregnant. The genetic condition, which is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome, can result in developmental delays. “It was very scary, because it wasn’t just Down Syndrome,” she explained. “There was a whole range of other issues, and also a possibility that the child may not survive pregnancy and childbirth. “And when I asked the doctors if there was anything I could do about it, or if there is any treatment for the condition, they said no, but there’s an option for termination.\"  But termination, she stressed, had never crossed her mind. “I’ve waited so long for a child, and I’ve grown up valuing life and knowing there’s always a reason why things happen ... to me, it was just a challenge that I had to overcome,” she said. She had spoken in a previous interview about how she and her husband were seeking treatment to conceive. And she added that having gone through a previous pregnancy which ended in a miscarriage made her even more cautious. “I didn’t want to dwell on it too much, but that kind of added a layer of fear,” she said. “But it was that uncertainty and concern about not knowing, and not being able to see the child, and worrying that the child may not survive the pregnancy. “I didn’t even buy baby things until much later, because I wasn’t even sure that the baby would grow,” she added. Dealing with her own emotions was one thing, and she recalled that picking herself up and simply getting busy “without thinking so much about it” helped her work out her pain. But dealing with the emotions of her family members and loved ones was, she said, a whole different issue altogether. “I needed to tell them so they could prepare themselves mentally, but I couldn’t handle their reactions,” she said, recounting a particular conversation she had with her mother. “It was quite difficult when I was trying to tell her ... okay, don’t get so excited because something might happen and I want you to be okay with it,” she said. “But at the same time, you’ve just got to keep praying and hope for the best.” But ultimately, she is grateful for the support she got from her family members, who rallied around her and helped her out in ways big and small. “My mum would do little things on a daily basis like cooking for me, buying me maternity pants and new clothes, and my sister also bought me a top so I could look decent on National Day,” she said. “So it’s all these regular family things that may not matter so much, but it helps, because you’re just busy trying to get on with the days of your life.” “I COULDN’T REALLY CELEBRATE BECAUSE HE WASN’T THERE”  She remembers it was a “sad feeling” when Ayden was born, because she could not be with him. “The first day, I only saw him for a bit before they took him away to do tests,” she explained. “When people were visiting, they would ask me where the baby was, and because he was in the special care nursery, nobody got to see him. “I couldn’t really celebrate because he wasn’t there. So I focused on just getting better, so that I could walk and get out of bed and see him.” She recalled an incident when she burst into tears upon receiving news that Ayden was to be moved to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). “When I was walking to the NICU, I just burst,” she said. “I was crying and crying and I think I must have scared off other parents.” “The nurses all kind of panicked, and brought me to a room, and they brought out all my doctors who were very kind and explained everything to me,” she said. “Thankfully, it was just that it didn't look like he was breathing so well, so they had to bring him to NICU because the equipment was there.” FINDING SUPPORT FROM FAMILY, SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY  It was about three weeks before Ayden could be brought home from the hospital. But there was another part of the challenge: The constant medical appointments Ayden had to go for. Quipping that she was at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital so often that she should get a “club membership”, Mdm Rahayu recalled being there almost “every other week”. “It was so physically tiring, and there was work too,” she said, explaining that she started work again “fairly early”. She also started on her MP duties again, with Meet-the-People sessions coming in after a month, and market visits after two. Things have gotten less hectic now, as Ayden’s schedule has settled into “some sort of regularity”. But she remains grateful for the family support that has continued even after she gave birth. She considers herself fortunate to have a network of family members she can call on to help take care of Ayden when she and her husband have to work. “Everyone was very zen about it,” she said. “I used to be worried before, but now I’m a bit more zen about it too, because I know that there are people who are just there for me.”   Support was also found from the special needs community. It started small, from chatting with parents at Ayden’s sessions at the Down Syndrome Association, and she is now part of two informal WhatsApp groups for parents of children with Down Syndrome, which she says is a “repository of things”. “Sometimes, I’m hearing stories from mothers, and commiserating, and other times, it’s practical advice, like what to do when a child has constipation, or how to find a pre-school that accepts my child,” she said. “It’s beeping constantly, but it’s really useful”. Being plugged into the group – and the community – also came in useful when researching her speech in Parliament, as she was able to tap on the networks to meet different groups of parents to hear their stories and understand their concerns. But she stressed that while her speech was a good starting point to raise awareness for the community, she is well aware that she has not “fully captured everything”. “The spectrum is very diverse, and there are different levels of support for different groups and families,” she said. “But at least there’s the awareness now. So I need to keep track and follow through with some of the things I have pushed.” ON ADVOCATING FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY Mdm Rahayu recognises that her role as a Member of Parliament has placed her in a unique position to be a voice for issues close to her heart. Such as, for example, the special needs community. But she is quick to brush aside comparisons to her fellow MP Denise Phua, who is well-known for being an advocate for the community. “I definitely think I can help, but I cannot fill her shoes,” she said. “She is a legend in her own right, and she’s been around for years.” “But clearly, I am already putting my hand up for things related to this sector, because I can appreciate it and I already have a conduit of feedback I can convey. So I guess that’s part of it.” The title of advocate for the special needs community is, she added, a “big title that (she) feels too small to accept.” “It’s not that I’m starting anything new, it’s more like helping to push things to a new level,” she said. She added that there are also other issues she is already advocating for as an MP, such as multiracial harmony, families, youths, as well as the Malay language. “It’s not like I’m going to throw these away just because I have a new cause,” she said. But she stressed that inclusive education – and a compassionate society – remains something that is close to her heart, and something she will continue to speak out about.   “We’re at a stage where we’ve kind of met Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and we need to layer that with the soft aspects,” she said. “By being inclusive and creating awareness, then the community becomes more conscious.” “Look at how we did it with multiracialism,” she explained. “Where it is not an issue that your friend is from a different racial background. “Same thing for people with special needs ... where you really normalise it so you don’t see them because of their disability, but as someone who is part of your community.” Today, despite the initial road bumps on her journey, it is clear that Mdm Rahayu is embracing the experience of being a mother.  \"Of course I worry, but I’m embracing it,\" she said. \"I feel very fortunate and privileged to be given this honour to take care of him.\"  “We’re doing our best to make sure Ayden is up to speed,” she added. “But I really hope people won’t make fun of him, dismiss him or take advantage of him. “I hope the world will be a better place by the time he grows up.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/rahayu-mahzam-on-down-syndrome-son-special-needs-10607332"}, {"datetime": "11 Aug 2018 06:14AM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "boxing", "Jason Goh"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "His mum wants him to punch others: The Sanda fighter channeling his family's support at the Asian Games", "content": " SINGAPORE: Jason Goh vividly remembers the one and only time his father watched him fight \"live\". \"I won that one,\" the 23-year-old said softly, with pride in his voice. \"I fought and kicked until the opponent wasn’t able to stand,\" he continued, with his arms miming some quick shadowboxing. Due to work commitments, Goh's parents - his father works in sales while his mother is a dim sum chef - are usually unable to attend his matches. But this is not to say they have missed out on his development. Goh makes a meticulous effort to video all his bouts, so that his parents, along with his three brothers, can catch him in action, even when they cannot attend. \"Mentally, I feel stronger knowing they are behind me, even when they are not physically in the stands,\" he told Channel NewsAsia. \"They like to watch me, especially my youngest brother. He's my biggest fan.\" In a few weeks' time, Goh's family will be able to watch him make history as the first Singaporean to compete in the sport of Sanda at the upcoming Asian Games in Indonesia. A combat sport developed from traditional wushu techniques, Sanda involves the use of punching, kicking and throwing techniques, among others.  Athletes don protective headgear, mouth guards, gloves and chest protectors before fighting in furious, fast-paced bouts comprising of three two-minute rounds. There is a one-minute break between rounds. Judges award points based on several criteria, and the competitor who wins two rounds becomes the overall winner. Sanda, which comes under the broad umbrella of wushu, flies under the radar in Singapore when compared with other mainstream fight sports such as Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) or Muay Thai. There are about 1,000 Sanda exponents in Singapore, according to national coach Ng Boon Hock. \"Most of them practice in polytechnics, others in community clubs or gyms,\" said Ng. \"But their standards have to be raised much higher to reach the national team level - we have six in that squad.\" “When I tell others that I do Sanda, they will say is that MMA? Or Muay Thai? I usually tell them that its contact wushu,” Goh added. EVERYBODY WAS KUNGFU FIGHTING Weaned on old Bruce Lee films when he was in primary school, Goh grew up admiring the legendary kungfu fighter. “It was very shiok to watch it, there was that adrenaline rush,” said Goh \"I really liked his speed - the punches and kicks were very flexible and very fast. I would ask my father what sort of kungfu this was, and things like that. He told me it was Wing Chun but there is an actual combat component of wushu - Sanda. That sparked my interest.\" Goh's father participated in the sport of Sanda during his younger days, but did not compete due to a heart problem. His son would take more than ten years to follow in his footsteps. \"There were not many Sanda clubs in Singapore back then - only one or two,\" said Goh. “I have three brothers who were all studying and so I felt that maybe we couldn’t afford it (if I went to train in a club). I wanted to wait till I started to earn money -that was in National Service (NS).\" Goh took up kickboxing while serving his NS before switching disciplines when his coach invited him to participate in a Sanda tournament. “The explosiveness and the speed of Sanda drew me to the sport. You have to go into moves quickly with a lot of force,\" said Goh. “It’s actually similar to a chess game. You have a very short time to analyse your opponents. When I hit, I have to always anticipate the next move. You need to know when your opponent makes a move towards you, and how you are going to react next.” While others might dread training sessions, Goh relishes them - even if they takes an additional toll on top of his full-time occupation as a fitness trainer with Certis Cisco. He trains six times a week, on top of conducting physical training for staff as part of his day job. “It’s a bit tiring but manageable, If I don’t train, I will feel I have like nothing to do and no outlet (to release my energy).” SANDA FOR SINGAPORE Given the physicality of the sport, Sanda is not without its risks.  Goh has suffered a shoulder separation in the past, and grapples with nerve issues on his other arm - which once resulted in him being unable to lift his hand when preparing for the World Wushu Championships in Kazan, Russia last year. These troubles are now behind him, he is quick to add, but Goh still could face the music back at home. “My mum doesn’t like me to get hit. There was one time I came home from a competition with a black eye, then she looked at me and said that I was very lousy,” he added with a laugh. \"She wants me to punch others, and I'd better not get punched.\" There is a quiet confidence about Goh, despite only picking up Sanda in 2015. \"He is a reserved guy,\" explained Ng. \"Jason often keeps to himself, but when he is up against an opponent you can really see his endurance and fighting spirit.\" Goh finished fifth in Kazan after being knocked out in the quarter-finals. The result was enough for him to meet the qualification mark set for the Asian Games, becoming the first Singaporean to feature in the event since Sanda was introduced to the tournament twenty years ago. But making history doesn’t seem to stress Goh out either – the thought of being Singapore’s first ever Sanda athlete at the Asian Games did not even cross his mind, till it was raised prior to his interview with Channel NewsAsia. “My goal is to do my best. I feel like every fight is a final and I plan to learn from every fight,” said Goh, who will be competing in the men’s 56kg category.  “There’s no need to stress, I trained hard and I know I’ll be okay.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-sanda-fighter-wushu-kungfu-jason-goh-10599168"}, {"datetime": "11 Aug 2018 06:08AM", "tags": ["HFMD", "parenting", "exams", "children", "tuition"], "author": "June Yong", "title": "Commentary: Afraid your kids will catch HFMD? Don’t let modern day parenting be ruled by fear ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Parental fear begins from the moment you find out that you are going to have a child. Will my baby be alright? What if I give birth prematurely? Will we have sufficient finances to give the child our best? The list goes on… Then by some miracle the child grows up strong and healthy, and new fears emerge. When I read the news about the HFMD virus that has been spreading like wildfire in Malaysia, I couldn’t help but worry. My second child contracted it when he was three, and it was one of the hardest seven days of his life. When I see posters warning of terrorist attacks and public service messages telling us what to do in cases of molestation, I fear for the day when my kids will travel on public transport on their own. But should we allow these fears to drive our behaviour? Because of the potential threat of catching a virus, do I ban my kids from going near a playground? We often tell our kids that they should face their fears bravely, and that it’s unproductive to worry unnecessarily, but are we taking our own pill of faith? RAISING A WORRY GENERATION? Academics is another huge area where children seem to be hapless victims of parental paranoia. Led by an overwhelming fear that our offspring will be disadvantaged when “everyone else is doing it”, we enrol them in all manner of tuition even before they start Primary 1. For many of our children, tuition is a way of life, regardless of the stage of academic life. Granted, that our children will be left behind or struggle later in life are very real concerns. These lead us to constantly wonder: “Am I doing enough?” They may also lead to extreme measures such as having for tuition in all four subjects when the child is already coping well, just so they have something to occupy them while we are away. But as parents, we have the responsibility to define what is enough, and not let societal expectations and our own fears lead the way. We have a duty to build their sense of confidence to face an uncertain future. The onus is on us to put a dam against the flood of anxiety. Anxiety is contagious. The more anxious we feel about our children’s grades and achievements, be it extra-curricular or academic, the more our children will feel it, and hold back from taking risks. Are our fears feeding into a generation of anxious youths? And how do we expect them to rise up to challenges and adapt to change, if we cannot model the same courage and resilience we want to see in them? CODDLING OUR YOUNG These attitudes can shape our everyday actions if we are not mindful. As a parent of three school-aged children, I sometimes catch myself doing things for them that they are fully capable of doing. One example is clearing their plates after meals. My fingers instinctively find their way to their plates. I have to remind myself that I’m doing them a disservice by “helping”. Many of us grew up in households where we were expected to help out at a tender age. I recall being allowed to head downstairs to grab bread or simple grocery items by the time I was in Primary 2. Having to cross a carpark to the provision shop was never a major safety issue, and I probably developed a strong awareness of my surroundings on these occasions. Serving in the home is a great way to instill responsibility and ownership. Yet why don’t we enlist their help more often? I wonder if the strong emphasis on academics is a big factor here. There seems to be an underlying assumption that kids should just focus on their studies, and be excused from other “menial” tasks. Where then will they get a chance to learn responsibility? And will they grow up with a warped belief that their sole purpose is to get good grades, get into a good school, and earn a good living?      Will they learn that life has no model answers or automatic route to success? TAMING OUR FEARS AND INSTILLING CONFIDENCE Giving in to our fears may cost us invaluable opportunities to build our children’s independence, responsibility and life skills. Perhaps it is time to examine and confront them.   Weigh the consequences of taking a small risk, such as allowing your child to take public transport on their own for the first time. And what is the worst that could happen if we roster our kids to dinner table or laundry duties? For schoolwork, review the goals that you and your child have set. Before the upcoming semestral assessment (otherwise notoriously known as SA2), discuss the options that are available if they fall short or exceed those goals. If they show improvement in a subject that they have been getting tuition for, it may be time to drop some tuition classes, and find alternative uses for the time gained. This way, they will start to see that they need not rely on any tuition teacher for the rest of their lives. They also gain a chance to grow their own resourcefulness and desire to learn. Fear that leads to over-protection (or over-tuition) can stifle the growth of our children’s inner resilience and strength. What we can do though is map out a plan to stare these challenges in the face. As Singapore just celebrated her 53rd birthday, my hope is that we too will find our inner strength and resourcefulness as a society, and carry on that same grit and perseverance our nation’s pioneers exemplified. Our children will find and carve their own pathways in life. All we need to do is to tame our fears and instill in them a belief that they can do it.     June Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hfmd-modern-parenting-how-to-bring-up-strong-resilient-kids-10606084"}, {"datetime": "10 Aug 2018 10:42PM", "tags": ["traffic accidents"], "author": "", "title": "Man taken to hospital after metal pole smashes through van windscreen along TPE", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 31-year-old man was taken to hospital after a metal pole smashed through the windscreen of his van while he was travelling along the Tampines Expressway (TPE) on Tuesday (Aug 7).

From the year earlier, Singapore's second quarter final gross domestic product (GDP) was forecast to expand 4.1 per cent, up from the 3.8 per cent growth in the initial estimates announced in July but slower than the 4.3 per cent growth seen in the first quarter, the poll's median of 10 economist showed. The poll also predicted quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.3 per cent in the April-June period on a seasonally adjusted and annualised basis. That's an acceleration from the 1.0 per cent rise in the preliminary figure but slower than the 1.5 per cent rise in the previous quarter. The upward revisions, analysts say, are caused primarily by a jump in factory output seen in the second quarter, driven by the pharmaceutical and electronics sectors and recovery in the marine and offshore engineering industry. However, a dependence on manufacturing and export sectors as well as an impending trade war between the United States and China are causes for concern. \"Singapore's economy is still a one-trick pony, which is still led by manufacturing and trade-related sectors. The advance figures haven't really shown that growth is broadening like what we first thought,\" said Jeff Ng, Asia Chief Economist at Continuum Economics. \"With trade pressures coming in, it may cause the economy to come off a bit,\" Ng added. Singapore in April tightened its monetary policy for the first time in six years and an upward revision to GDP in the second quarter gives the central bank a stronger case to tighten again, analysts say.

These were among the recommendations the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) has made to help women break out of poverty, after speaking to 47 low-income mothers who were actively trying to find work. On top of ComCare assistance after employment, AWARE suggested that the Government match savings by this group dollar for dollar. ComCare provides assistance after the beneficiaries find employment on a case-by-case basis. The advocacy group made these recommendations in a report titled “Why are you not working?” It was prompted by knowledge that women who were placed in jobs by a charity were not able to keep their jobs for long, said AWARE’s executive director Corinna Lim on Friday (Aug 10). The charity that tried to place them was Daughters of Tomorrow, which supports low-income women by trying to find them work. Ms Lim said that AWARE presented the findings of the report to representatives of government agencies about two weeks ago. CHALLENGES THAT LOW-INCOME WOMEN FACE The typical respondent was aged between 36 and 40, and had attained either N or O-Level education. “Our findings show that mothers from low-income households are constrained by inadequate formal childcare, and prevailing working conditions that do not offer decent jobs. This has wide-reaching consequences on their lives and the next generation's financial security,” AWARE said. Among the challenges that these women faced was the need to prove that they had worked a certain number of hours in order to qualify for subsidised childcare, or being unable to work due to a lack of family support. In the case of mothers who managed to secure places in childcare centres, they were also unable to get care support when the childcare centre closed for functions, or when the child was not well. According to the report, the women also faced a lack of CPF and leave benefits, and unlawful sacking, for example, when they were pregnant. AWARE said that 47 is a large sample size for qualitative research that went into the report. The advocacy group will host a panel discussion to launch the report publicly on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/aware-recommends-free-childcare-for-low-income-families-10607312"}, {"datetime": "10 Aug 2018 06:09PM", "tags": ["ComfortDelGro", "transport", "business"], "author": "", "title": "ComfortDelGro's Q2 net profit falls by 5.5%", "content": " SINGAPORE: ComfortDelGro's net profit fell by 5.5 per cent to S$75 million in the second quarter, a shallower dip compared to the previous quarter with the company announcing an increase in group revenue on the back of maiden contributions from new acquisitions. Revenue for the quarter ended June 2018 increased by 5.4 per cent to S$941.1 million, with ComfortDelGro attributing this to its \"aggressive expansionary policy\" in a statement on Friday (Aug 10). Since the beginning of the year the company has invested S$269 million in various acquisitions, with contributions from new subsidiaries like National Patient Transport and Tullamarine Bus Lines in Australia as well as AZ Bus in Singapore helping to boost topline figures, said ComfortDelGro. The actual revenue increase of S$46.2 million was further aided by a positive foreign currency translation effect of S$1.8 million, it added. For the half-year ended Jun 30, 2018, group revenue increased by 3.2 per cent to S$1.82 billion while net profit attributable to shareholders fell by 12.7 per cent to S$141.3 million. Improvement in the underlying businesses came from the public transport services business and the driving centre business offset by decreases in the taxi business, the automotive engineering services business, the car rental and leasing business, the bus station business and the inspection and testing services business, according to ComfortDelGro. Revenue from ComfortDelGro's public transport services business increased by 13.9 per cent to $667.9 million on the back of growth in Singapore, Australia and the United Kingdom. Growth came from higher fees earned, higher mileages operated as well as contributions from newly acquired businesses, said ComfortDelGro. However it said that the rail business would continue to be challenging due to a fare reduction which came into effect on Dec 29 last year and rising operating and maintenance costs. In Singapore, rail ridership continued to grow but operations continued to incur losses as the fare revenue was not sufficient to cover rising operating and maintenance costs, said ComfortDelGro. Meanwhile, revenue for the taxi business decreased by 12 per cent year-on-year to S$184.7 million due to a smaller operating fleet. However, revenue is expected to be maintained for the taxi business, the company said, citing stabilisation in Singapore and recent acquisitions in China, Australia and the United Kingdom. “We performed better in the second quarter compared to the previous one and also narrowed the variance year-on-year,\" said ComfortDelGro Managing Director/Group CEO Yang Ban Seng. \"This was largely due to the continued growth of the public transport services business and the stabilisation of the taxi business in Singapore.\" \"With a more rational competition landscape, the recruitment of taxi drivers has improved leading to a higher utilisation of the fleet,\" he said, adding that the company was also expanding its taxi fleet to meet growing demand.

He was also banned from driving for one year.

He failed a breathalyser test and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Jeyendran was taken to the Traffic Police Division, where it was revealed that he had 48 micrograms of alcohol in every 100ml of breath, which exceeded the limit of 35 micrograms in every 100ml of breath. The counsel admitted that he had an alcoholic cocktail at a pub at about 4am before heading home.

He added that he had been cooperative with police officers when stopped, and asked for the minimum punishment. Deputy Public Prosecutor Bhajanvir Singh said he would leave the sentencing up to the court. District Judge Victor Yeo said he took note of Jeyendran's points that he had been celebrating a friend's birthday. Jeyendran also said that he only wanted a Coke or a Sprite, but took the alcohol offered by his friend as he did not want to disappoint him. The judge said he \"was not entirely persuaded\" by this argument. \"In my view, he could have declined the drink,\" he said.

For his first drink driving offence, Jeyendran could have been jailed for up to six months or fined between S$1,000 and S$5,000. The AGC said it took a \"serious view\" of offences committed by its officers and would not hesitate to take appropriate action against them. \"In this case, AGC promptly initiated prosecutorial action against the offending officer and the officer has been duly sentenced to a fine of S$1,600 and disqualification from driving for 12 months by the State Courts for his offence,\" said an AGC spokesperson.  \"As the upholder of the rule of law, AGC expects our officers to uphold high standards of integrity and discipline.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/agc-counsel-fined-s-1-600-gets-one-year-driving-ban-for-drink-10606576"}, {"datetime": "10 Aug 2018 04:34PM", "tags": ["Woodlands Checkpoint", "Immigration and Checkpoints Authority"], "author": "", "title": "4,510 sachets of chewing tobacco intercepted at Woodlands Checkpoint on National Day", "content": " SINGAPORE: Thousands of sachets of chewing tobacco were found in a Malaysia-registered car at Woodlands Checkpoint on National Day, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in a Facebook post on Friday (Aug 10).

That is because the HDB had embarked on a small-scale, week-long trial late in July to see if drones are able to complement building inspection efforts, particularly for hard to reach places or those that may pose more risk. An HDB spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that the agency and town councils carry out such regular inspections of public housing facades to make sure they are in good condition. These, the spokesperson said, are typically carried out by workers using gondolas. That said, the intention of the drone pilot for the four HDB blocks was to “carry out more comprehensive inspections, especially at areas which are less accessible to workers using gondolas”, the official said in an email. This comes even as building owners look set to come under greater pressure to have a regular inspection regime. Specifically, buildings taller than 13 metres and older than 20 years will have to be inspected every seven years, said then-Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee. The drone inspections were carried out between Jul 26 and Aug 2, during a two-hour window in the morning and afternoon, HDB said. When Channel NewsAsia visited one of the blocks and observed the inspection process earlier this month, it was apparent that safety was topmost in the minds of the outsourced drone operators. The team of six men was set up at an open basketball court with the drone taking pride of place in the middle, cordoned off by safety cones and tape. Equipped with walkie-talkies, three of the men took up positions at the outer edges of the area where the drone will be hovering over. The drone operator stood a few steps behind the drone, watched on by two others. The whole inspection process took about 10 to 15 minutes for one side of the HDB block, but it is unclear if the footage captured was sufficient or more flights were in the pipeline that day. ASSISTED BY AI The drone was operated by HUS Unmanned Systems, which was granted a permit to do so by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), said HDB in a circular notifying residents of the four blocks. Making sense of the images taken will be done by an artificial intelligence (AI) system from H3 Zoom.AI, which, like HUS, belongs to Singapore-headquartered parent company H3 Dynamics Holdings. Essentially, the drone will take thousands of pictures and these will be uploaded to the AI system hosted on the cloud, which allows for quick analysis to be done. The system will then identify defects in a report generated automatically after each inspection, with a shorter wait time to boot.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/heady-days-use-of-drones-to-detect-defects-on-hdb-blocks-takes-10599070"}, {"datetime": "09 Aug 2018 11:30PM", "tags": [], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "First look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 – and its Bluetooth stylus", "content": " NEW YORK: An eye-catching Bluetooth-enabled yellow stylus, loads of storage space, an intelligent camera, and more – Samsung Electronics unveiled its latest smartphone, the Galaxy Note 9, at its Galaxy Unpacked event on Thursday (Aug 9). Or, to be more precise, much of it was a confirmation of the premium smartphone’s features following various online leaks way before the launch held at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, where Samsung also announced a new Galaxy Watch and smart speaker, as well as a collaboration with Spotify.  In his opening address, Samsung CEO DJ Koh described the Note series as being the “leading smartphone for achievers and creators”, adding that the latest iteration would “raise the bar for speed, power and performance once again”.  BATTERY AND STORAGE Taking note of just how much Galaxy Note users use their phones, Samsung has beefed up the Galaxy Note 9 in terms of power and storage to keep up with the demands of work, gaming, watching movies and more throughout the day. “You shouldn’t have to plan your day around your phone’s battery life,” said Drew Blackard, Samsung product manager, at the event. “You can power through your entire day with just the phone in your pocket.”  Its 4,000mAh battery is the biggest ever on a Samsung phone – 21 per cent bigger than the Galaxy Note 8. It also offers the fastest network speed, capable of up to 1.2 gigabits per second (GBPS), meaning superfast streaming and downloading of movies, which is good when you’re in a rush. And, finally, there’s all that space you’ll need so there’s no fretting about deleting photos, videos or apps. It’s available with two internal storage options, 128GB or 512GB. Together with the option to insert a microSD card of up to 512 GB, that’s a whopping 1TB of space. (In comparison, Apple’s iPhone X has 64GB and 256GB options, while Samsung’s own Galaxy Note 8 and S9 has 64GB, and S9+ goes up to 256GB). THAT’S ONE INTELLIGENT CAMERA Described as Samsung’s smartest camera yet, the Galaxy Note 9 improves on the camera platform found in the Galaxy S9 and S9+ phones, which includes the Dual Aperture lens feature. It now also has an AI-based Scene Optimiser that automatically analyses the image and does the necessary tweaks for more dynamic photos. There are 20 scene categories, such as “flowers”, “landscapes” and “beaches”. The Flaw Detection feature can now also spot if you’ve got problems with blinking eyes, blurred images and backlighting, in addition to previously calling out if there’s some smudging on the lens. For low-light environments, the HDR and Live Focus improvements are set to be a boon. S-PEN WITH BLUETOOTH Samsung has cited the S-Pen as the number one reason for Galaxy Note fans’ loyalty. And while hardcore users might have fun debating about aesthetics of having a yellow S-Pen for its main Ocean Blue-coloured model (the rest come in matching colours), the stylus’ Bluetooth capabilities is another matter altogether. With a few clicks, you can control the phone with it from a distance of up to 10m, for a variety of things: Taking photos, playing YouTube videos and going back and forth within the photo gallery. You can also play around with the AR Emoji stickers on Live Message by drawing and writing on it. Don’t think your photos make the mark? The S Pen also lets you trace over your own photos to make it look a bit more “artistic”. The S Pen’s Bluetooth features run for up to 30 minutes standby time or 200 button clicks per full charge, which takes around 40 seconds when you insert the stylus into the phone. NOTED FOR WORK AND PLAY Gamers will also be pleased with the phone’s robustness – aside from the long battery life, the Galaxy Note 9 also has a new water-carbon cooling hardware system, which is said to prevent overheating by 21 per cent. An AI-based performance adjusting algorithm software also manages the phone’s functions when it senses it’s getting too hot. These, together with its 6.4 inch AMOLED infinity display (slightly bigger than the Note 8’s 6.3 inch display) and stereo speakers, means a steady, long and intense gaming experience. In relation to this, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney dropped by to announce that their popular online game Fortnite will be available for download on Samsung mobile devices, the first time it can be played on Android phones.  Work-wise, Galaxy Note 9 users can still tap into the Samsung DeX experience – but it does one better than the S9’s docking station by skipping that entirely and simply plugging directly into a monitor using an HDMI adapter. The phone can then function as a touchpad and controller, or even serve as a second screen for taking down notes – which means easy multi-tasking at, say, a meeting or presentation with just one device. The Galaxy Note 9 will be available in Singapore from Aug 25 in Midnight Black, Metallic Copper with matching S Pen, and Ocean Blue with a Yellow S Pen. Preorders available from Aug 10. Prices start from S$1,398.

Only it wasn’t a rock concert, but the show segment of this year’s National Day Parade (NDP) on Thursday (Aug 9), and the guitar solo was a rendition of the national anthem Majulah Singapura. The theme of Singapore’s 53rd birthday celebration, We Are Singapore, aims to recognise everyday Singaporeans who share a common identity, and the show managed to drive this home across three acts that proved to be equal parts nostalgia and visual bonanza. Act One opened with more 600 Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students rushing onto stage, each dressed in a nod to Singapore’s humble beginnings. Some were samsui women, others were sweaty pushcart sellers peddling steamed chicken - all dancing to a beat that celebrated the Singapore spirit, as they illustrated how our forefathers forged the Singapore we know today.  The students were also joined by real workers of the present - cleaners, construction workers, teachers and bus drivers. And the props, including luggage carts, satellite dishes, even gleaming Housing and Development Board blocks, made everything come alive. If the first act was all about the dynamism, the one that followed was a feast for the eyes. Against the night sky, a brilliantly illuminated procession of 18 boats and floats sailed in across Marina Bay, which by now was occupied by the watching hundreds who didn’t have tickets. Fronting the parade were three floats, each carrying one of the nostalgic dragon, dove and pelican playgrounds. The almost gloomy lights reflected singer Aisyah Aziz’s ethereal vocals, but the mood picked up when 12 sparkling balloon garlands, each 18m long, snaked into the show. Like jellyfish tentacles flickering in different colours, the garlands reached high into the sky. The spectators obliged, swinging their light bubbles to the vibrant performance. The performance itself was a visual spectacle - more than 700 primary and secondary school students formed kaleidoscopic patterns with lighted lanterns, in what organisers hope would mirror the hopes and aspirations of the people. But perhaps what tugged at heartstrings the most was the show film, directed by acclaimed filmmaker Boo Junfeng, that depicted real-life stories of five Singaporeans - a former samsui woman, ex-Olympic runner, struggling student, visually impaired busker and young social entrepreneur. The film, woven throughout the three acts seamlessly on giant screens, showed how these individuals overcame challenges to achieve their goals. The stories were heartwarming, and the feature on the blind busker and his son – a common sight near Tampines MRT – would have identified with many. Speaking after the show, researcher Ahmad Ahmad, 27, said the film “really captured” the essence of what Singapore is. “I could relate to it,” said Ahmad, a first-time NDP spectator who got lucky on his first try balloting for tickets. While the show segment takes the plaudits, the pre-parade segment - always a crowd favourite - deserves high praise as well. The crowd gasped as they watched - footage captured from the bird’s eye view of unmanned aerial vehicle Heron-1 - eight naval combat divers jump off a helicopter 2,000m in the air. This is the first time that the divers, complete with masks, fins and rifles, are jumping at the NDP.  Hundreds chanted “hooyah!” as the divers, like black dots in the sky, deployed their parachutes and dropped in the water. Also doing their own jump were the hugely popular Red Lions, this time from 3,800m in the air – the highest ever for an NDP. While the weather made the jump impossible in 2016, it was all clear skies on Thursday. The wingsuited Red Lions, leaving behind red and white smoke trails, landed in a jog just in front of the stage, to much aplomb. Standing together, the divers and Red Lions saluted the nation. “I’ve done this 20 times,” host Gurmit Singh said. “It never gets old.”  What also never gets old are all-time favourite National Day songs, and so there was time to get the crowd involved in a little singing competition. The hosts picked out a few from the crowd and asked each to sing along to a song, before abruptly stopping it mid-sentence. To win, participants had to complete the line, and many gamely guessed correctly, cheered on by those sitting around them. The melodious and even passionate voices soon turned to the thumps of the parade drums, as Singapore’s armed forces, police and civil defence force rolled onto stage. Soon it was time for a landmark moment: President Halimah Yacob, in her first NDP holding the nation’s highest office, arrived and waved to cheers from the crowd.  As she inspected the parade, artillery cannons parked on the water volleyed as a mark of respect. The highest honour, however, were the five F-15SG fighter jets that pulled off a bomb burst against the sprawling skyline. With a boom they soared in formation above the crowd, before splitting up and zooming in different directions.  But the Republic of Singapore Air Force, celebrating its 50th jubilee, had more to show. In another impressive aerobatic display, an F-15SG executed a knife edge pass, pulled around the towering Marina Bay Sands, and shot into a gravity-defying vertical climb. Still, the fireworks, which lit up the sky with loud colours and louder pops, remained the highlight of the show for many spectators.  While regular NDP spectator Huang Zijuan, 35, said she enjoyed the fireworks the most, she added that the performance by the ITE students stood out too. “The props were very nice,” said Ms Huang, an investor who came with her six-year-old son Gideon. Ms Huang said she ballots for the NDP every year, and will try again next year because it’s always a fun experience. “It’s one big party,” she added. Mr Benjamin Cavalli, 45, praised the entire show, but reserved special mention for the fireworks. This is not the first time that the Swiss banker has attended the NDP with his family, and he didn’t need to answer when asked if he’d try again next year. “Yes,” chimed in his smiling 10-year-old daughter Chiara. “We’ve been here for more than 18 years,” Mr Cavalli said. “This is home for us.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-2018-everyday-singaporeans-stunning-visuals-nostalgia-10603810"}, {"datetime": "09 Aug 2018 01:28PM", "tags": ["lift upgrading", "Sembawang", "Woodlands"], "author": "Gwyneth Teo", "title": "12,600 households to benefit from S$33m lift replacement programme", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three estates - Sembawang, Woodlands and Admiralty - will have 280 lifts replaced ahead of schedule under the Sembawang Town Council's Lift Replacement Programme (LRP). In a press release on Thursday (Aug 9), the town council said that it will be footing the S$33 million bill for the programme from its Lift Replacement Fund (LRP). \"Resident need not pay for the new lifts,\" the town council added. Usually, lifts are replaced every 28 years. However these lifts at 135 blocks in the three estates have been in operation between 21 and 24 years. Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC Amrin Amin said the lifts were chosen for earlier replacement because they were still having issues even after being repaired and maintained.  The 280 lifts make up more than half of the lifts in the estates that have been in operation for at least 20 years.  \"This is the most economical way because most of the lifts are above 20 years old. We think with the maintenance issues, we'd like to replace them so that it can be of benefit residents,\" said Mr Amrin. In all, 12,600 households are expected to benefit when the upgrading is complete. The replacement will take two years, and is expected to be completed by June 2020. The lifts in each block will be replaced one set at a time. According to the town council, residents can expect the replacement at their blocks to take eight months. Mr Amrin said this is one of the most expensive expenditures ever undertaken for lifts. The lifts will be more spacious and will be able to take 10 people, as compared to eight people currently, making it easier for wheelchair-bound residents. The lifts will also be faster, travelling at 90 metres per minute instead of 60 metres, which is comparable to lifts in new residential estates. They will also adhere to the latest safety guidelines on new lift installation as laid out by the Building and Construction Authority.  The town council said upgrading began last month for blocks 677 to 680 in Woodlands Avenue 6. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/12-600-households-to-benefit-from-s-33m-lift-replacement-10602522"}, {"datetime": "09 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["animals", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "‘Some people think I’m crazy’: What makes Singapore’s ant-man tick", "content": " SINGAPORE: The night-time is when this muscular man, sporting tattoos and an ear stud, goes hunting around void decks. He lives in Hougang but goes to HDB estates round the island, even those more than an hour away. Mr Zat Low is especially likely to make a catch when it rains. That is when a queen ant would emerge from its nest to mate, and it would typically fly towards a lighted place such as a void deck. Armed with a laminated card and a test tube, the 34-year-old tattoo artist would be all smiles when he spots his prize, like the time he found a queen crawling inside a lift. He is not the only one hunting ants after night falls. Singapore Ants, a Facebook group of ant lovers and collectors he helped to start, has about 1,640 members. That is four times the group’s membership in June last year. Unlike most other ant-keepers, however, he has even gone into forested spots to lure ants with a light box. But more than that, he likes the time alone. “I love the night life because everything is so quiet. Everybody is asleep” he said. I’m not scared of being in the forest alone. I think humans are much scarier. His is one of the stories featured in the documentary series Singapore After Dark, about people who come to life at night. They include a private investigator, an amateur astronomer, night fishermen as well as animal rescuers, wildlife surveyors and a joss paper maker who burns his goods for wandering spirits. (Watch the show here.) In the case of Mr Low, his hobby has given him more than a unique perspective of Singapore by night, it has also given him a renewed purpose in life, “a lot of truth” and “joy”. AN IDEA HATCHED FROM EGGS It started some three years ago when a friend, a bird enthusiast, showed him a bag of ant eggs he bought to feed his birds. Mr Low figured that it could be a good business opportunity and decided to catch queen ants – recognised by their wings and swollen bottoms – to harvest their eggs as bird feed. But after half a year, he found it too tedious, even though he reckoned that he and a partner who was doing the sales were each making S$4,000 a month. From what he had learnt online, ant-keeping seemed more interesting – even former United States president Bill Clinton has two ant farms – so he decided to start his own colonies instead of selling the eggs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But it was such a niche hobby in Singapore that he had to do more online research and get tips from ant-keeping communities worldwide. For instance, it may take up to a month for a queen ant to lay its eggs. If it does not, it may not be fertilised, and he would release it. He also learnt to build his own formicariums (ant nests) and now has more than 100 colonies. Some of them are crammed into his room, while others are looked after by his friends from the ant-keeping community, whose members range from students to housewives to working professionals like lawyers and doctors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n They share tips about caring for their colonies and where to hunt for rare finds. Different HDB estates attract different ant species because of their location near different forested areas, explained Mr Low. We’d never know what we’d find. We’re like Pokemon Go players. His parents were initially sceptical about his hobby but now even wander into his room to admire his collection: Formicariums of different shapes and sizes surrounded by walls adorned with some of his favourite tattoo art pieces. He is a favourite of his young nieces and nephews and cousins, who are curious about and in awe of his pastime. ANTS SAVED HIM Ant-keeping is more than just a hobby for him, however – it helped to save his life. Three years ago was also when he was at the lowest point in his life. He used to have bad mood swings, which affected his relationship with his family and close friends. “I used to be a very arrogant person. I had hurt a lot of people, both emotionally and physically,” disclosed Mr Low, a former gang member. He became depressed, partly because he had also lost friends who had taken their own lives. But after he came to terms with his past actions and personal losses, he began to rethink his life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “I found that life was kind of meaningless, but I didn’t want to spiral downwards to that,” he said. Then I looked at ants, and I realised that they’re so small and are fighting for survival. What (about) me then? His ants kept him busy, and helped to keep him from feeling depressed, even though some of his friends and relatives thought it was a “lame” hobby at first. Some people still do. “Some people think I’m crazy. They say, ‘Why ants?’ But I find ants an enigma to me,” explained Mr Low, who remains fascinated by their social behaviour, hierarchy and caste systems, as well as the similarities between humans and ants. Ants invented farming – 60 million years ago – he pointed out, noting that some ant species still farm fungus to sustain their colonies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ants also operate within a highly developed division of labour: Some ants are in charge of foraging, some defend the nest while others tend to the queen. “Ants have remarkable capabilities. For example, some enslave other ants while others can show the highest levels of altruism,” said Mr Low, citing a species of self-sacrificial ants from Borneo that can explode themselves to cover intruders with toxic goo. Today, he can rattle off the scientific names of ant species in Singapore – like the Polyrhachis beccarii (the golden ant) and the Dinomyrmex gigas (giant forest ant) – and their characteristics with ease. HOPING TO HELP OTHERS Mr Low got out of his rut after about two years, through his ants and regular exercise, and is now focused on sustaining his ant colonies and building formicariums, some of which he sells. These formicariums are typically made of acrylic plastic or aerated cement; the elaborate ones are decorated with crystals. He even has one with a music box inside. A formicarium can be set up for as little as S$5 and can sell for as much as a four-digit figure, depending on the craftsmanship involved and crystals used. It costs him less than S$50 a month to feed his ants, with a concoction of chicken, flour and multivitamins, among other things, that he formulated himself. For the ants’ “carbohydrate needs”, he gives them the blackcurrant drink Ribena. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He used to sell his ants but stopped doing so, even though a rare queen Dinomyrmex gigas can cost €1,000 (S$1,580) on the European black market. He preferred to concentrate on acquiring and sharing knowledge about ants with the local community, including children. He thinks that by educating more people about ant-keeping, he can “give people a glimpse of hope when they feel hopeless or helpless”, like how it helped him to rediscover himself and the natural world. “My main purpose in starting an ant community is to make people understand that ants can be a pet too, not just pests,” said Mr Low, who now views ants as “sacred creatures” for saving him. “I also have great ambitions for the ant industry, whether harvesting its eggs for food (a delicacy in Thailand and Mexico, for example), formicarium-making or making ant presentations to schools. We can venture into a lot of things.” Watch the webisode Antman of Singapore here.

He was among 4,624 people who were recognised for their significant contributions to the nation. Recipients came from varied backgrounds, including the civil service, educational institutions and grassroots organisations. In a statement, Dr Tan said he is \"deeply humbled and greatly honoured\" to receive the award. “Together with many of my generation, I was privileged to serve my country, to see it grow and thrive. “Our nation remains a work in progress, and Singapore needs the service of men and women from all walks of life to build on our strong foundations to ensure an even brighter future for our nation,” said Dr Tan. The 78-year-old, who started out as a lecturer in 1964, entered politics in 1979. Over the decades, he has served in various roles, including being minister for finance, education, defence and trade and industry, as well as deputy prime minister. After retiring from Cabinet in 2005, Dr Tan took on the mantle of chairmanship in several organisations such as Singapore Press Holdings and the National Research Foundation. In 2011, he was sworn in as the seventh President of Singapore - a position he held until 2017. Said Dr Tan: “It has been truly rewarding to work for, and alongside, so many Singaporeans who envisioned a better future for their children and grandchildren.” RECIPIENTS FROM VARIED BACKGROUNDS Among those who received the Meritorious Service Medal was Ustaz Ali Mohamed, co-chairman of the Religious Rehabilitation Group. He has been with the organisation since 2003, when it was launched with a mission to correct misinterpretations of Islamic concepts and dispel extremist ideologies. The challenge, he said, is the time and patience needed to reform radicalised individuals. And although there is no end to the work that needs to be done, he called it “a blessing” to be involved. For his efforts, Ustaz Ali previously received the Public Service Medal in 2001 and the Public Service Star in 2010. One recipient of the Public Service Medal is Mr Rajaram Ramasubban, chairman of the Tamil Language Council. Along with volunteers and his team, the council organises the Tamil Language Festival every year. The month-long festival has been running for 12 years, with Mr Rajaram helming six editions. “Knowing your language is important because the language is a window to the way of life that you belong to, the culture that you belong to,” said Mr Rajaram. He added that the challenge of preserving the language lies in reaching out to youths and making it attractive for them. Nevertheless, he said volunteer work is meaningful and that the award serves as an encouragement. “You don't start off by expecting to get an award, but it’s always nice to be acknowledged. This is an acknowledgement not just of the work that I've done - I’m aided by a whole group of volunteers. “At the same time, the experience of volunteering is a very meaningful and rewarding one. So to that extent it’s already a very meaningful experience and this (award) is sort of an icing on the cake,” he said. TEAMS INVOLVED IN TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT, PEDRA BRANCA CASES RECOGNISED In addition, seven teams were awarded the President’s Certificate of Commendation for their contributions in organising the historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Jun 12. The teams were from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Communications and Information, Prime Minister’s Office, broadcaster Mediacorp, Singapore Police Force, Singapore Armed Forces as well as a group from 11 other government agencies that supported security operations. Mediacorp CEO Tham Loke Kheng said: “The Mediacorp Team are honoured to receive the President’s Certificate of Commendation. We’re glad to have brought our broadcast and production experience to bear in the landmark summit, watched by the whole world. And we’re especially proud of the teamwork demonstrated by our people – this made it possible for us to provide extensive support and coverage to journalists from across the globe.” For their contributions to the Pedra Branca cases, an inter-agency team also received the President’s Certificate of Commendation.

Delivering his National Day message from the estate designed for senior citizens, Mr Lee highlighted inbuilt features like grab bars and non-slip tiles in the flats, as well as co-located amenities such as a supermarket, medical centre, community garden, childcare centre and a hawker centre. Mr Lee added that the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will continue to develop other innovative housing concepts, for the young as well as the old, so future generations can also own their homes and live comfortably and happily in their neighbourhoods. He said that the Government has been reviewing major housing, education and healthcare policies in the last few years, making changes to improve the lives of Singaporeans, strengthen social safety nets and build a more cohesive nation. The Kampung Admiralty housing estate, he said, is an example of what the Government is doing to transform these three areas. “When people express concern over the cost of living, these are three significant items they worry about,” he said. “In Singapore, we ensure that these key public services are both of high quality and affordable for all Singaporeans, rich or poor.” “This is how we’ve helped families to manage their cost of living, and given an extra hand to those who need it,” he added. “For more than five decades, this approach has worked well.” As for existing housing estates, Mr Lee said they will be maintained and upgraded as the years pass. “Though the leases still have many years to run, we should think ahead about how we can keep older estates in good living condition, and also start to redevelop them, in order to build new homes and towns for future generations,” he said. GOVERNMENT ALSO WATCHING EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY In his message, Mr Lee stressed that the Government is watching external developments closely.  Singapore, he said, has come a long way in the past 53 years, with productivity improving and incomes rising. However, there are some “clouds on the horizon”. For example, trade tensions between major economies have “seriously worsened” over the past year, affecting international trade, investments and business confidence. “Singapore’s own growth and prosperity will be affected too,” said Mr Lee. “Trade conflicts will also erode trust between the major powers, and hinder their cooperation on other important issues.” “And hence, regional and international security are at risk.” In the area of international security, Mr Lee pointed out that while the recent Trump-Kim summit meeting has eased Korean tensions, there are “many challenges still to be overcome” before denuclearisation and peace are achieved on the Korean Peninsula. Describing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a “life raft in an uncertain world”, Mr Lee added that as chair of the grouping this year, Singapore will aim to further cooperation with its ASEAN partners, and in particular with Malaysia and Indonesia, Singapore’s two closest neighbours. But in the meantime, Mr Lee said the Government is strengthening Singapore’s resilience and creating new opportunities. “We want Singapore to do the best we can, whatever the external circumstances,” he said. Mr Lee noted that by planning boldly and creatively, Singapore can be reimagined, its heartlands remade and communities rejuvenated. “The work of building Singapore for the next 50 years will be a massive, long-term undertaking lasting more than a generation,” he said. “To sustain this project, we will need a strong economy and sound government finances.” “Most importantly, we need social cohesion, political stability and good government for many years to come, in order to carry out and realise our vision.” Read the full message here. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-national-day-message-kampung-admiralty-10600380"}, {"datetime": "08 Aug 2018 06:25PM", "tags": ["Goh Chok Tong", "politics", "employment", "society"], "author": "", "title": "'Salaries is not our starting point in looking for ministers': Goh Chok Tong responds to criticism of comments on pay", "content": " SINGAPORE: Emeritus Senior Minister (ESM) Goh Chok Tong has responded to what he described as the “heated reactions” to his comments on how to attract people to serve as ministers and the role salaries play in getting people to serve in Government. In a Facebook post on Wednesday (Aug 8), Mr Goh said there is a “silver lining” to the reactions: “It shows Singaporeans care deeply and hold leaders to account for their words and performance.” He also suggested that the audio clip of his comments at the event for South East District residents last Thursday (Aug 2) distorted his message by “omitting the full discussion”. Comments made by Mr Goh at the event for South East District residents were released on Facebook by online platform MustShareNews. This was then reported by The Online Citizen (TOC) on Sunday, which included a transcript of the conversation that it said was provided by ESM Goh’s staff to “clarify the recording”. Mr Goh had said that Singapore’s ministers are “not paid enough”. This was in response to a suggestion by a resident, Mr Abdul Aziz, to cut ministers’ salaries or the defence budget to fund support for the elderly. The suggestion was put to a panel at the event, which included Mr Goh, grassroots adviser Lim Biow Chuan and Senior Minister of State Maliki Osman. According to the transcript of the discussion, later provided to Channel NewsAsia by Mr Goh’s press secretary and also published on Mr Goh’s Facebook page, Mr Goh responded to the resident by saying: “Had you suggested we up GST by 2 per cent and give them the pension, I would have applauded you. Seriously. Because you are then taxing the whole society to support older ones.  “But you did not. You said cut from defence, 1 per cent is enough. And on top of that, you said cut ministers’ salaries. That is very populist.” “I am telling you the ministers are not paid enough, and down the road, we are going to get a problem with getting people to join the Government, because civil servants now earn more than ministers. Are you aware of that?\" Mr Goh added. He asked where Singaporeans would want to get office holders from. A 75 PER CENT CUT IN SALARY Mr Goh then revealed that former lawyer Edwin Tong took a pay cut of about 75 per cent when he became a Senior Minister of State for Health and Law earlier this year. Mr Tong was earning more than S$2 million as a Senior Counsel, said Mr Goh, adding that he was asked by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to be a minister of state. \"He came to see me,” Mr Goh said. “He said, at this stage of his life, he has got a house, he has got a mother-in-law to support, a father-in-law to support, his own parents and so on, what should he do? \"So I asked him, Edwin, what were you in politics for? (He said) Here to serve. So I said you’ve got to serve, well, you know between S$2 million and perhaps half a million, later on you hopefully become a full minister, S$1 million, you have to decide which is more important.\" \"So Edwin told me his job in politics is to serve,\" Mr Goh added. \"He said, 'yes, I will take on' (the job), and he felt very strongly that he could do the job.\" Mr Goh added, however, that “now we dare not pay ministers a good wage”, and repeated his question, asking where Singaporeans would want to get ministers from. “From people who earn only S$500,000 a year, whose capacity is S$500,000 a year? So (when) I look for ministers, anybody who wants to be paid more than half a million, I won’t take him,” Mr Goh said. “You are going to end up with very, very mediocre people, who can’t even earn a million dollars outside to be our minister.” In his Facebook post, Mr Goh said that he “did not mean nor believe that Singaporeans at whatever level of income are mediocre. Those who have worked with me know people matter the most to me.”  He went on to say that in times of prolonged crisis and upheaval, he had no doubt that Singaporeans will step forward to serve. Money would not be a key vector. “In peace and prosperity however, there are no dragons to slay. Personal aspirations, freedom, privacy and life-style take precedence.” He also shared a response that he sent to a medical student who had contacted Mr Goh with his views on the issue: “Salaries is not our starting point in looking for ministers. Character, motivation, commitment, selflessness, practical abilities, competence and proven performance are the main attributes we look for. The first four attributes are veto factors,” said Mr Goh.  “When we look at abilities, competence and performance are reflected in a person's compensation.” At the dialogue, Mr Aziz also suggested that a pension scheme for the elderly could be funded by cutting the defence budget. Mr Goh asked where exactly the spending would be cut. \"Do we take it from national servicemen, pay them less? Or we buy less weapons, your weapons?\" he asked. Given Singapore's size, Mr Goh said that the country's defence required an advanced warning system, which \"costs money\". If Singapore cannot defend itself, Mr Goh questioned whether investors would be willing to put their money in the country. If investors stay away, he warned, Singapore’s economy will not grow and there will be unemployment. Addressing Mr Aziz’s idea of helping older people, Mr Goh said: “Your idea is not wrong, we must do something for the older ones. Silver Support, some kind of a scheme that we can work on later on. But how to fund it? That is what I am hitting at.\" “There are many retirees, they haven’t got funds, they need to be supported,” Mr Goh added. “But how do you fund it, you see. That is key. How to fund it for the future? Make it sustainable?” He said that once the Government comes up with a scheme to help the elderly, it will have to think of how to raise taxes to pay for it.

Danial Ali Liaqat Ali had pleaded guilty in March to six charges ranging from rash acts to theft. According to court documents, Danial was \"inspired\" by the act of someone else throwing down items from the block of flats where he lived. He decided to follow suit, and threw multiple items down over a few days in December last year. The items include a mahjong table, a tin of sardines and a padlock, which landed on the windscreen of a vehicle, costing the owner about S$700 in damages. He was arrested on Dec 12, 2017, after the police identified him as one of the people involved in killer litter. Investigations revealed that Danial had made his 19-year-old girlfriend pregnant a month before his killer litter offences. ANGRY WITH THE POLICE OVER HIS GIRLFRIEND'S ABORTION His girlfriend decided to get an abortion, on the advice of her parents, but Danial tried to ask her to keep the baby, to no avail. He called the police for help to mediate, and felt that the police did not render sufficient assistance. His girlfriend eventually aborted the baby, and Danial was \"unhappy with the police for their perceived inaction\", court documents said. When he saw police officers at the scene on Dec 7, 2017, responding to a case of killer litter, he decided to throw down more items. He wanted more police officers to attend to the scene, so that they would \"do work and not slack off\", according to court documents. He went down to the void deck to observe the police officers who were there and saw a powerbank casing on the floor, that he said was not thrown down by him. He retrieved the item and handed it to one of the officers and told another officer that he saw a glass cover that was thrown down, before returning home. On Wednesday, District Judge Eddy Tham sentenced Danial to 24 months' probation and ordered him to perform 180 hours of community service.

Five other similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. All the offences took place in October last year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a news release.  Phua had permitted her maids to clean the windows' exterior at the two-storey bungalow at Cluny Park on four occasions. The maids had to stand on a 7m-tall L-shaped scaffold that was erected outside the bungalow's main building to reach the windows, which did not have grilles installed.  MOM said that such acts should have been undertaken by service providers instead, and that Phua had endangered the maids' life by permitting them to carrying out those acts.  Phua also failed to provide a safe working environment for the maids and did not take necessary measures to ensure their safety, the ministry added.  The maids, who had been employed to carry out household chores, were also told to work as a scaffolder and a maintenance worker without valid work permits in the same month, said MOM. One of the maids had raised concerns that it was dangerous to climb onto the scaffold to work, but Phua persuaded her to carry out the tasks, said MOM.  Both maids have since been stopped from working for Phua by MOM. One of the maids has been placed under the temporary job scheme and works for a new employer, while the other has returned home.  MOM director of well-being Jeanette Har said that the case was \"egregious\".  \"Lives and limbs are at stake here ... The risks are real and obvious but the employer was oblivious to them,\" she said.  Phua could have been fined up to S$10,000 and jailed 12 months for each charge of failing to ensure the work safety of domestic workers.  For illegal employment, Phua could have been fined up to S$30,000 and jailed up to 12 months.

Or are you planning to catch the parade on TV or online with your friends and family?  As Singapore's 53rd birthday rolls round, here's our pick of the five highlights to look out for - and remember - at NDP 2018. 1. NAVY DIVERS AND RED LIONS  First, look out for the eight-member Naval Diving Unit (NDU) as they free-fall more than 1,800 metres from a Super Puma helicopter into the water.  The move is one used in actual operations and will give an insight to the maritime operations conducted by divers when they need to enter an area that isn't easily or quickly accessible by other means. After that, the perennial crowd favourite, the Red Lions, will perform a wingsuit jump from a record height of 3,800 metres - more than 750m higher than their previous performances. They will jump from a C-130 plane above Sentosa and glide towards the Marina Bay floating platform at speeds of up to 200kmh before a minute-long free fall. 2. RSAF AERIAL SEGMENT Keep looking up - this year's NDP will feature an \"enhanced\" aerial segment, involving as many as 21 Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aircraft. The planes will fly in formation towards the floating platform before fighter jets execute aerial aerobatics over the Marina Bay skies. 3. 20KG BALLOON GARLANDS  Look out for these 18m-high balloon garlands in the second act of the show segment. The 12 massive garlands will transfix you as they sway and twinkle against the evening sky - but perhaps less obvious is the sheer strength and stamina it takes to handle the balloons.  It's been likened to pulling with a 20kg weight while sprinting, and performers have to resist the upward pull of the balloons even when they're standing still.  Our reporter Lianne Chia gave it a go:  4. SAILING DOWN MEMORY LANE  Also in the second act of the show is an 18-vessel water procession that will sail around Marina Bay. In a nod to Singapore's heritage, some of the floats have been modelled after iconic playgrounds of yesteryear. Which ones do you recognise? 5.

Two senior members of the debate community were then appointed to conduct an independent audit of the programme and interview former members.  On top of criticism about the DDI's structure and operation, interviewees from the first two cycles also made \"disturbing allegations of misconduct\" against the director.  DDI members used a central WhatsApp chat group to arrange training sessions and participation in competitions. The director was part of the group.  He also moderated a separate chat group named DDI Darkness, which comprised some members from Cycles 1 and 2. The report found that a number of comments made in this chat group were sexual in nature and included discussions about sexual acts and preferences, as well as the sexual history of chat participants.  \"These comments were initiated by the DDI director, who also led discussions on the objectification of DDI members who were minors,\" according to the Debate Singapore statement.  Photos of DDI members would surface in this chat and there would be comments on physical characteristics, including genitalia, it added.  \"One DDI member reported that these comments later continued in a private chat with the DDI director. In July 2014, the DDI director shared explicit pictures of himself in this private chat and pressured the member to reciprocate by sending similar photos. \"This continued until the end of 2014, where it culminated in a physical sexual encounter initiated by the director,\" said the association.  The names of those involved were not disclosed in the statement \"so as not to interfere with ongoing investigations or potential legal proceedings\". Meanwhile, the Debate Development Initiative has been \"shut down with immediate effect\".  In a post uploaded to the Facebook group Singapore Debaters, the executive committee said: \"If you are harassed or made to feel uncomfortable by an individual within the community, no matter how prominent they may be, do not hesitate to come forward.  \"All reports made by the equity committee will be confidential and each case will be treated with the utmost care and sensitivity.\"  The police confirmed a report was lodged and that they are looking into the matter.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/debate-association-singapore-director-sexual-misconduct-students-10599572"}, {"datetime": "08 Aug 2018 04:04PM", "tags": ["COE", "transport"], "author": "", "title": "COE premiums for cars go up in latest bidding exercise", "content": " SINGAPORE: Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices closed mixed in the latest bidding exercise on Wednesday (Aug 8), with premiums for cars inching up again.  For Category A cars, or those 1,600cc and below with horsepower not exceeding 130bhp, premiums closed at S$33,798, up from S$32,699 in the last exercise.  Premiums for larger and more powerful cars in Category B rose to S$34,381 from S$32,551.

These were partially offset by lower portfolio gains and contribution from the group's residential business, CapitaLand said in a statement on Wednesday (Aug 8) before the market opened. Revenue for the quarter increased 35.3 per cent to S$1.34 billion on the back of rental revenue from its new properties in Singapore, China and Germany, higher handover of residential units in China, as well as the consolidation of revenue from CapitaLand Mall Trust, CapitaLand Retail China Trust and RCS Trust. In the second quarter of 2018, the group divested Twenty Anson, an office building in Tanjong Pagar, and Sembawang shopping centre. Outside of Singapore, it re-allocated capital to a prime mixed-use site in Chongqing, China and its second grade A office in Frankfurt Germany, among others. Eighty per cent of Capitaland's capital is deployed in investment properties while 20 per cent is in trading properties.

The teenager - who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim - sexually assaulted his sister in 2013, when she was 10. The boy was 12 years old at the time of the crime. The court heard that the boy was exposed to pornography in 2013. Although he was initially disgusted by it, he soon became more interested and began surfing pornographic websites, court documents said. He eventually felt the urge to simulate what he saw on those websites. In September 2013, the boy became aroused after watching a television show with a bedroom scene. He summoned his sister, who was alone with him in the flat, and told her he wanted to \"try something with her\".  He threatened to tell their parents about her mobile phone usage if she did not comply. He proceeded to penetrate her without a condom, stopping only when she complained of pain. Their parents subsequently found out that the boy had touched his sister’s private parts on several occasions. They did not lodge a police report, but since 2014, both children had been seeing a counsellor from the Counselling and Care Centre.  BOY MOVED TO STAY WITH GRANDPARENTS Arrangements were also made for the boy to move to his grandparents’ home so as to keep him away from his sister. After six months of counselling, he was assessed to have reintegrated well and allowed to move back home. However, in August 2016, the boy started watching pornography again \"due to the stress he felt over his studies\". He asked his sister, then 13, into his bedroom and molested her. That same month, his mother told the counsellor that her son had continued to commit sexual offences against her daughter. The matter was referred to the Child Protective Service of the Ministry of Social and Family Development, and a police report was made in April 2017. The boy pleaded guilty in June to one charge of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 and one charge of outrage of modesty. Six other charges of molesting and having sex with his sister were taken into consideration for sentencing. PROSECUTOR ASKS JUDGE NOT TO ALLOW ACCUSED TO STAY IN HOME WITH YOUNG GIRLS District Judge May Mesenas sentenced the teenager to 21 months' probation. He also has to perform 180 hours of community service and undergo counselling and psychological treatment. Additionally, an Internet filter service must be installed on mobile communication devices used by the accused, so as to allow his parents to monitor his Internet usage. Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim also asked the judge to include in the court order that the boy should not live in a household with any females under the age of 16. \"The offences he committed against his sister - she was a ready and available target,\" said Mr Lim. \"We have to cut off the availability of any victims for him to prey on.\" The judge agreed. She also ordered that any future contact between the teenager and his sister be supervised by an adult. When asked if he had anything to say, the accused, who was unrepresented, said he was very regretful and asked for a second chance. \"Do you really understand and treasure this chance? Because you have committed a very serious offence against your only sister, your younger sister, and threatened her,\" said the judge. \"I really hope that she can heal from this. The parents are in a most difficult situation.\" Speaking to the boy's parents, the judge said that they would need to go for counselling as a family. Turning to the boy, she said: \"You have to respect women. And I think you have to respect your mother as well, (judging from) the way you speak to her.\" For sexual penetration of a minor under 16, the teenager could have been jailed up to 20 years and fined or caned.

The property developer on Wednesday (Aug 8) posted a net profit of S$204.8 million, up from S$114.1 million in the same period a year ago. The rise came alongside an almost 60 per cent increase in revenue for the quarter to S$1.36 billion, compared with S$854 million last year. The group said that the gains were powered by a strong performance from its property development segment, which contributed 78 per cent of profit before tax during the quarter.  In Singapore, CDL sold 651 residential units worth S$1.29 billion in the first half of the year, boosted by healthy take-up for two launches at New Futura in Leonie Hill Road and The Tapestry in Tampines. Although the number of units sold during that time frame was 5.8 per cent lower than the same period last year, the sales value was up 12.1 per cent. In China, CDL sold 170 units worth 691 million yuan in the first half of the year. In response to the property cooling measures introduced last month, CDL Group CEO, Mr Sherman Kwek, said that he expects the pace and volume of sales to take a hit. The only silver lining, he added, is that prices for Government Land Sale (GLS) sites could be moderated. The developer acquired Amber Park in a record freehold en bloc sale last year. It also bid a pretty penny for Sumang Walk — which set a record unit land price bid for an executive condominium (EC) site earlier this year. Going forward, Mr Kwek said that CDL will adopt a more cautious approach with its land bids — carefully reviewing sites that will “enable a distinct advantage”. For example, he said their upcoming launch, Whistler Grand in West Coast Vale, is in an area where there is little competition and good demand. He added that the group will continue to focus on ECs, given the dearth of supply in that segment. Integrated developments are also an area where the company can value-add, he said. As for outlook, the group maintained that it is “well-poised” for its next phase of growth. “Our globally diversified portfolio of residential developments and recurring income properties also enables us to weather headwinds that impact specific asset classes or markets,\" Mr Kwek said. “We remain focused on growing our recurring income significantly over the next 10 years through strategic acquisitions, investments and asset enhancements.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cdl-posts-79-5-rise-in-q2-profit-on-the-back-of-strong-sales-10598848"}, {"datetime": "08 Aug 2018 08:03AM", "tags": ["Singtel", "telcos"], "author": "Brandon Tanoto", "title": "Singtel’s Q1 profit falls 6.6% as competition hits affiliate income", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singtel's first-quarter net profit fell 6.6 per cent from a year ago, in part due to fierce competition in some of its markets and adverse currency movements. Singtel, Southeast Asia's largest telecom operator, on Wednesday (Aug 8) posted a net profit of S$832 million for the three months ended in June, compared with S$890 million in the same period last year. Underlying net profit, which excludes one-time items, fell more than 19 per cent to S$733 million. Revenue fell 0.5 per cent to S$4.13 billion. Competition affected India's Bharti Airtel and Indonesia's Telkomsel, in which Singtel owns stakes, leading to a decline in its regional associates' overall profits. Singtel is also set to face fresh competition in its home market of Singapore with the expected arrival of a new entrant later this year. In a statement released to the Singapore Exchange, Singtel said that Airtel's profits were affected by intense competition, as well as mandated cuts in mobile termination rates in India.  Telkomsel's earnings were weighed down by intense price competition, particularly during the mandatory registration of prepaid SIM cards, Singtel said. According to the telco, this exercise has since been completed and the pricing situation improved towards the end of June. Singtel CEO Chua Sock Koong said: “While competition remains keen in Indonesia and particularly India, both Telkomsel and Airtel have nonetheless gained market share. We have started to see revenue stabilise on a sequential quarter basis for India.  \"As leading operators in their markets, all our regional associates continue to ride the growth in data and we are positive on their long-term growth potential.” In Australia, Optus logged stronger operating revenue on the back of continued customer growth, supported mainly by sustained investments in networks, technology and content. As for Singapore, consumer revenue rose but continued to be affected by factors such as an increase in demand for SIM-only plans.

He also likes real estate investment trusts (REITS), such as Frasers Centrepoint Trust and Keppel DC REIT.  To be sure, defensive plays, such as consumer staples and utilities that are typically resilient during periods of economic downturns, have started gaining traction among investors amid recent market gyrations.  SingTel rose 5 per cent to end July at S$3.21, while spirits maker Thai Beverage rallied 8 per cent to cap off last month at S$0.76.  Sheng Siong - a clear favourite among market watchers - gained about 1 per cent to S$1.07 at the end of July. “The outperformance in some of these stocks shows investors looking for some shelter,” said Phillip Securities' research head Paul Chew.  Elsewhere in the market, local lenders remain favourable, with DBS analysts noting that it’s time to accumulate positions following the release of quarterly report cards.  Over the past week, OCBC and UOB announced second-quarter net profit results that beat market estimates, while DBS posted a weaker-than-expected net profit gain for the same period as the impact of business volume growth was moderated by lower trading income.  Even as all three banks flagged concerns about a slower home loan market following the recent property cooling measures, analysts remained positive.  “We still like the banks as they give (investors) a decent dividend yield of about 4 per cent and they will benefit from this rising interest rate environment,” Mr Chew told Channel NewsAsia over the phone.  “No doubt, the cooling measures will temper some loan growth expectations but that’s likely for next year. Like what the banks mentioned, (the impact) won’t be immediate as most of the loans have been secured and as they get disbursed, they will provide some growth for now,” he added.  Similarly, OCBC’s research head Carmen Lee said while the property curbs will rein in mortgage growth especially in FY2019, this is likely to be mitigated by growth in other areas, including cards, investment and higher trading income.  Ms Lee has a “tactical overweight” on the banking sector with “buy” calls for DBS and UOB at current prices.  “With lower allowances, improving margins, as well as healthy dividend payout ratios and yields, we remain fairly optimistic on the outlook for the banks for the coming 1 to 2 years,” she wrote in a note.  CHIEF OF CONCERNS: TRADE WOES Analysts said market movements will continue to be hinged on how trade tensions develop, though risks such as a stronger greenback, rising interest rates and local housing curbs could add to the downbeat sentiments.  All eyes will likely be on more duties that may be imposed on US$16 billion worth of Chinese goods this month. 25 per cent tariffs imposed on the first tranche of Chinese products valued at US$34 billion took effect on Jul 6, with Beijing responding in kind on the same value of US goods.  The Trump administration has also said that it may jack up the tariff rate on the next US$200 billion of Chinese imports – a proposal that China has said it would hit back with new tariffs on US$60 billion worth of American goods.  “Odds are low that the US-China trade war will subside anytime soon,” said DBS analysts in an Aug 6 note. Also likely to weigh down the local equity market’s performance is a unique seasonal effect, they added.  Dubbing the trend as “The ghost of August”, Mr Yeo and Ms Chua wrote that the Singapore market has recorded losses for the month of August “without fail over the past 10 years”.  DBS data showed the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) suffered a median decline of 2.1 per cent and an average decline of 4.2 per cent in August over the past decade.  Given the host of uncertainties, these analysts expect the trend of a “negative August” to continue this year.  But there may be a chance for the local bourse to grind higher with banking heavyweights leading the way, reckoned Mr Chew from Phillip Securities. The three local banks make up about 40 per cent of the index.  Trade war fears are also no longer a new risk, he added.  “For one, tariffs are already imposed on almost all exports between US and China. That’s about as far as you can go for now… Under such circumstances, it’s hard to be extremely bullish or bearish because these trade skirmishes could escalate or disappear overnight given how it all depends on one person,” said Mr Chew, referring to the unpredictability of US President Donald Trump.  Nonetheless, taking into account the uncertainties ahead, Phillip Securities has revised down its year-end target for the STI to 2,700, from 2,900.  Noting that the STI has seen its peak in May when it hit 3,614, DBS analysts expect a choppy third quarter, with the benchmark index testing the 3,220 level in the “down month” of August.  As to how local stocks will round off 2018, much will depend on the outcome of the US-China trade war. “Base view is that while trade war developments could worsen during next two months, it should subside in the fourth quarter heading to the US mid-term elections, with STI ending the year at 3,550,” said Mr Yeo and Ms Chua. On the other hand, a bear case scenario – defined as an all-out trade war with a 10 to 25 per cent tariff imposed on all products traded between China and the US – will see the STI plummeting to 2,915.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/take-shelter-in-singapore-banks-defensive-stocks-amid-trade-10596438"}, {"datetime": "08 Aug 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Celebrity", "National Day"], "author": "May Seah", "title": "What do Gurmit Singh, Chen Liping and Rayson Tan have in common with Singapore besides being the same age?", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: If you were born in 1965, it’s hard to forget how old you are – especially on Aug 9 every year. That’s the case for Gurmit Singh, Chen Liping and Rayson Tan, who happen to be the same age as Singapore. And just as Singapore has matured and developed over her 53 years of independence, these celebs can also look back and say they have come a long way – and are definitely not stopping here. This National Day, they tell us their hopes and dreams for the future and for Singapore. GURMIT SINGH This year marks Gurmit’s 20th year as one of the hosts for the National Day Parade, a true testament to the actor and comedian’s enduring popularity. While he’s working the crowd at the Marina Bay Floating Platform, the fans who grew up watching him on TV can also appreciate his contributions to the local entertainment scene. \"The difference between Singapore and myself is that every year, Singapore gets better and more developed and more high tech, whereas I am going the other way,” Gurmit joked. “But seriously, some people see getting older as a bad thing, but I see age as just a number. I’m still enjoying the same way of life as I did back in my 30s and 40s – going to the gym, meeting friends and being active. I think the fact that I have a five-year-old helps as well! I can’t lie back and say, \"I’m going to be a grandfather soon.'\" If he could go back in time to advise his younger self, he would say: \"Save more, invest more and don’t be an idiot and spend so much,\" he quipped. \"It was only after I met my wife that I picked up the habit of saving. If I knew then what I know now, I’d always put some serious money aside, as opposed to, 'Oh, I’ve got money now, I’d better buy the latest laptop or phone.' That will never end.\" For the future, “I think the first thing I want to wish for the nation and myself is good health. Increasingly, that’s my priority. If I’m doing too much at the expense of my health, then I have to take a look and say, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t do this.’ I think it’s the same for Singapore,” he said. “We have progressed so fast that it’s incredible. But I also want Singapore to take note, as a people and as a government, of where our roots are, and be able to keep that alive. One way of doing that, I think, is to keep the architecture. There are landmarks that I sometimes feel have been torn down for the sake of progress – I’m still very sore about the old National Library. I know that the government has taken steps to earmark some buildings as national heritage, and I think that’s the right way to go.” CHEN LIPING At 53, Chen Liping asserts, she’s far from done learning. “No matter how old you are, you have to keep learning without ceasing. That’s true for me even when I’ve been in the industry for so long,” she said. “Every show, every phase of life, offers something to learn from, experience or overcome.” Those are weighty words coming from somebody who has been acting for 33 years and counting, and is still remembered for her iconic roles such as that of a teacher in 1989’s Good Morning, Sir!. But on the subject of school, if there’s anything she could go back and do again, she said, she would put a little more effort into her studies. “I think back to when I was a student. I loved outdoor activities and exercising,” she said. “Sometimes I think to myself, ‘Why didn’t I work a little harder? It wasn’t that I was lazy; I just liked sports, so I didn’t focus wholeheartedly on my studies. I went to a Chinese school, but then I switched to an English school, so now, my language skills are neither here nor there. I really admire people who can write and speak well. Many people say academics aren’t that important, but I think that when you’re young, you should put more effort into studying.” Still, her love of outdoor activities laid foundations for active roles in sports dramas such as 1990’s volleyball-themed The Winning Team. Having found her career niche early on, Chen’s love for acting hasn’t abated at midlife. “It’s been so many years, but the passion is still there. I love thinking about how to craft each and every one of my roles, obtain inspiration from the scripts and deliver my best,” said the actress, who currently stars in the drama Say Cheese, airing weekdays at 9pm on Mediacorp TV Channel 8. At 53, growth is still on her mind. “Things are always moving forward and changing, especially in television and with social media. We have to be able to keep up. No one knows about the future. We will all grow together. In Singapore, everything is very well established. How to maintain that is another question. I think that’s the challenge. It’s that way with people and also with the country.” RAYSON TAN “Singapore is a green and growing garden city. I think I’m the same – not that I’ve lived to 53 and refuse to admit that I’ve aged, but that my mindset is still 30-something. That keeps me energetic,” said actor Rayson Tan, who happens to be married to Chen and also stars in Say Cheese. “I think I’m like Singapore in that aspect – having a young mindset and continuing to grow and learn. Once a person ceases to grow, they start to age.” At this period in his life, “I have more confidence in myself,” he said. And “I’m learning now to be slow to speak, slow to get angry and quick to listen.” Also, “I’ve learnt to live in the moment. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to enjoy the process. I used to be very much focused on achievements and outcomes, and I neglected the process.” His wish for Singapore’s future is a very practical one. “I really hope Singaporeans will have more babies,” he stated matter-of-factly. “If we’re lacking in population, we lack the chance to groom our own talent, and we’ll have to absorb talent from outside. For the sake of our country, we should have more babies. I mean that sincerely. “From the time of our birth, every step we take moves us closer to the grave.

The 43-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the girl, committed the offences between August and October 2012.  He confessed to the police in 2016, when he was filing a report against his now ex-wife for harassment. The court heard that the girl and her two siblings were living with their uncle as their father was in prison. On Aug 9, 2012, the man molested his niece in a taxi on the way home from watching the fireworks on National Day. That night, he molested her in her bedroom. Two months later, while the girl was sleeping, he entered her bedroom again and used her hand to perform a sexual act on himself. WIFE DISCOVERS WHAT HAPPENED, VIEWS CCTV FOOTAGE Later that same year, the man's wife asked the girl why she had been coming home late after school and scolded her. She then revealed that she had been touched when she was sleeping at night, and began crying. When the girl's grandmother asked the man if he had touched his niece inappropriately, he denied it, court documents said. He admitted to the offence only after his wife checked footage from a closed-circuit television camera inside the bedroom where the victim slept with her siblings. The man begged his wife not to report the matter to the police. The incident went unreported, and the man's wife arranged for the victim and her sister to sleep in the same room as their grandmother. After what happened, the man's relationship with his wife deteriorated.  On Apr 1, 2016, his wife went to his office in Raffles Place to confront him over an alleged affair, prompting him to lodge a police report against her for harassment. The pair were in the midst of divorce proceedings at the time. During the interview with the investigation officer, the man confessed that he had molested his niece on multiple occasions, and that his wife had CCTV images of these actions. A doctor later found that the man's niece had insomnia due to fear that her uncle \"might come at night and touch her again\". ACCUSED SUFFERED MARITAL AND FINANCIAL STRESS: DEFENCE On Tuesday, the man's lawyer S S Dhillon said that the victim started living with her uncle since 2011, before moving in permanently a year later. The girl's father had ill-treated her and her siblings, he added. \"The accused had to bear the burden of supporting them financially,\" said Mr Dhillon. \"He was suffering from marital and financial stress and depression when he committed these foolish acts and felt disgusted with himself after that.\" The lawyer added that the man's ex-wife had written a letter to the judge, saying that he was a good man and that she had forgiven him. Mr Dhillon asked District Judge Jasvender Kaur to take the man's voluntary confession as a mitigating factor. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Lai pointed out that the man knew his wife had CCTV footage of the acts. \"He would be well aware that if he informed the police about his wife (and her alleged harassment of him), she would tell them about it,\" said the prosecutor. Mr Dhillon responded: \"Nobody knows what the wife would have done. She could have kept silent. She kept silent for four years!\" The man was convicted of three charges of using criminal force on a minor under 14 years old intending to outrage her modesty. In passing the sentence, the judge said that she took into account the young age of the victim and the man's betrayal of her trust. He could have been jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-molested-13-year-old-niece-sentenced-to-jail-caning-10596716"}, {"datetime": "07 Aug 2018 06:23PM", "tags": ["Republic of Singapore Air Force", "defence", "Ministry of Defence"], "author": "Deborah Wong", "title": "RSAF to roll out biggest aerial display of the year over National Day weekend", "content": " SINGAPORE: Buckle up aviation buffs – 29 aircraft will take to the skies for a special aerial display at the Marina Barrage on Aug 11 and 12.

ComfortDelGro said Forest Coach Lines, founded in 1930, runs a fleet of 220 buses spread over eight depots. It operates Region 14 contract bus services in Metropolitan New South Wales, other bus services in regional New South Wales as well as school and non-school charter services.  \"Growth prospects for the area it operates in are bright given that a major greenfield development, the Northern Beaches Hospital, is due to begin operations at the end of 2018,\" the company stated.  To operate the bus services, ComfortDelGro will be acquiring two freehold depot sites – the Terrey Hills Depot and the Toormina Depot – for A$15.45 million, it said.  Separately, the group also purchased the bus and coach assets of Coastal Liner Coaches, which operates route bus services in Outer Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Region 11, for A$9 million.  ComfortDelGro said that although this acquisition was lower in purchase price, it is no less significant given it services a growing market of retirees and young families moving away from Metropolitan Sydney to the more affordable coastal region.  The coastal operator has a fleet of 31 buses and coaches and also specialises in luxury coach tour packages for theatre performances, concerts and day tours for individuals and small groups, it said.  ComfortDelGro managing director and group CEO Yang Ban Seng said that Australia has been a key investment target for the group given its transparent and stable regulatory environment, strong growth prospects and proximity to Singapore.  \"We have been actively looking for worthwhile investments and when these opportunities presented themselves, we knew that they would complement our existing operations well and enable us to derive synergies.\" The transport operator entered the Australian market in 2005, and currently has a presence in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia with a total fleet of about 3,500 vehicles comprising buses, coaches, taxis and ambulances.

", "content": " SINGAPORE: A buzz was set off in Singapore’s usually dull political scene, when seven opposition parties announced plans last weekend to form a coalition, and extended an invite to former presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock to lead them. Buoyed by the stunning political developments across the Causeway, which saw the Barisan Nasional (BN) government toppled after an uninterrupted 61-year rule, some members of the proposed alliance are setting their sights high. “Our alliance must strive to form the next Government in the upcoming General Election (GE),” said former National Solidarity Party (NSP) chief Lim Tean, who is seeking to form a new party. Singapore’s next GE must be held by 2021. Writing on Facebook, Mr Lim added:  The winds of change are here and they have buffeted the world for the past two years… Those who try to suggest that what happened in the West and now Malaysia cannot possibly happen in Singapore are myopic and in denial. But not everyone is convinced. Rather than providing voters with a real choice of an alternative government and a force to be reckoned with at the next GE, the proposed coalition is a last-ditch effort by parties and personalities who have been bit-part players to avoid political oblivion, said some analysts interviewed. People’s Power Party (PPP) chief Goh Meng Seng was more circumspect about what the opposition parties were trying to achieve with the alliance. Citing the poor showing by the smaller opposition parties in the Republic’s last GE in 2015, Mr Goh said: \"We’re at rock-bottom. When we come to that stage, nothing could be worse (than) to try… a new approach to get a different result. If we don’t change, the results won’t change.\" The seven parties involved are the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), NSP, PPP, Democratic Progressive Party, Reform Party (RP), Singaporeans First, and Mr Lim’s as-yet-unregistered party People’s Voice. The Workers’ Party (WP) and the Singapore People’s Party (SPP), two of the most successful opposition parties in Singapore, are not part of the effort. At this stage, many questions remain unanswered. For instance, RP chairman Andy Zhu said it is unclear if the component parties will have to fold should the alliance come to pass, or if the coalition’s leaders have to resign from their current party posts while their old parties remain. The idea of the smaller opposition parties forming a new coalition and having Dr Tan as a leader was mooted two Saturdays ago during a working lunch chaired by SDP secretary-general Chee Soon Juan at his party’s premises. The meeting was held three weeks after the SDP brought in Malaysian politician Chua Tian Chang to speak about the opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) historic victory in the Malaysian election. Mr Chua is vice-president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, one of PH’s component parties. THE MALAYSIAN GE EFFECT The opposition leaders behind the proposed alliance have made clear that the Malaysian GE results had given them the impetus, and the belief that they can achieve a similar feat.   In the aftermath of the May 9 polls, many speculated whether Singapore could follow suit, as opposition supporters in the country hailed PH’s victory as a sign of things to come. Subsequent comments by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad — who returned to power after a 15-year hiatus by leading the PH alliance to victory — further fuelled such sentiments. Weeks after the Malaysian polls, Dr Mahathir told the Financial Times that PH's win would have a spillover effect on Singapore. \"I think the people of Singapore, like the people in Malaysia, must be tired of having the same government, the same party since independence,\" he said. However, some political observers and analysts have pointed out that the conditions in Malaysia and Singapore are vastly different. Banyan Tree executive chairman Ho Kwon Ping, for example, said last month that it would be a “foolish mistake” to think the People’s Action Party (PAP) will suffer the same fate as BN, even though there are \"unnervingly close parallels\" between the neighbouring countries. A \"huge and critical difference\" is the \"egregiously blatant\" corruption of the previous Malaysian government, said Mr Ho who was speaking at an OCBC Bank forum. Singapore and its people would be \"drawing the wrong lessons if we look at Malaysia and think that the fall of the PAP is imminent for whatever reasons that are happening across the Causeway”, he reiterated. \"It is not the absence of full democratic institutions, it is not the absence of full human rights, or the putting down of dissent, nor the presence of paternalistic governance which brings down a government, or has brought down the Malaysian government,\" he said. It is the unbridled, egregiously blatant and massively enormous corruption of the Najib (Malaysia's former premier) government which brought him down. Several political analysts noted that getting Dr Tan to lead the proposed coalition was straight out of the PH playbook. But the circumstances in Singapore could not be more different. Dr Tan, 78, has said that he is open to the idea of leading the coalition but stopped short of agreeing to take up the offer. Several opposition party leaders involved in the proposed coalition said they were pinning their hopes on Dr Tan to take charge — from shaping the form in which the coalition will take to attracting more qualified candidates into its ranks. Dr Tan, a medical doctor, was formerly a long-serving PAP Member of Parliament (MP), winning six consecutive elections — garnering at least 70 per cent of the vote each time — in the Ayer Rajah single member constituency between 1980 and 2001. He stepped down as an MP in 2006, and resigned from the PAP in 2011 to run in the Presidential Election (PE). He received almost 34.9 per cent of the vote in the four-cornered fight, losing to Dr Tony Tan by a razor-thin margin of about 0.3 percentage point.  Despite his popularity among Singaporeans and political credentials, any comparison of Dr Tan to Dr Mahathir, 93, is far-fetched, analysts said. The veteran Malaysian politician had been the country’s longest-serving prime minister before taking up the reins again, while Dr Tan had only been an MP, they added. The PH alliance is also highly mature, compared with the “much less organised” coalition being proposed here, said Nanyang Technological University (NTU) political scientist Woo Jun Jie. Retired political science professor Hussin Mutalib said there had been mass disenchantment across the Causeway leading to the polls, with major issues dogging the previous BN government, such as the financial scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. “The Malaysian setting that led to PH’s victory is far different from Singapore,” he reiterated. Never mind that the opposition leaders banking on any Malaysian GE effect could be setting themselves up for disappointment, they have their work cut out should the proposed coalition come to pass, the analysts said. The leaders will have to set aside their differences and party aspirations to forge a common vision and identity. They must also go beyond stirring dissatisfaction against the ruling PAP and chart clear and effective policies to convince voters. Building a pipeline of credible politicians will also be key to ensuring the group’s long-term viability, analysts added. Party leaders interviewed were acutely aware of the challenges that lie before them. This is not the first time that opposition parties have mooted a formal alliance. The most recent attempt saw the formation of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) by opposition figurehead Chiam See Tong in 2001. The SDA started out with four component parties: SPP (which was led by Mr Chiam), NSP, the Singapore Justice Party and the Singapore Malay National Organization (PKMS). Before long, cracks appeared. NSP withdrew from the alliance in 2007. Four years later, Mr Chiam and the SPP followed suit — just three months before the 2011 GE. The SDA floundered at the polls that year, where it was the worst-performing opposition party. For the latest effort to bear fruit, some opposition leaders acknowledged the need to not only put aside their egos but also agree on a common manifesto and identity to mount an effective electoral battle. PUTTING ASIDE EGOS, STRONG PERSONALITIES The egos of party leaders are the main obstacle, said Mr Zhu. “It is easy to come together, but it is difficult to put aside some of their leadership egos and ‘why do I have to listen to you’ and everything,” he added. Mr Zhu, however, struck an optimistic note, saying that the grouping comprises seasoned politicians who have been in the arena for a long time. “We believe that we know what we’re doing and who we’re dealing with,” he said. Assistant Professor Woo, who is from the NTU’s public policy and global affairs programme, noted the presence of “strong-willed leaders” such as RP secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam and Singaporeans First chief Tan Jee Say. Writing on Facebook a day after the parties proposed that he lead them, Dr Tan said some politicians from the seven parties may need to stand down and “serve from the backroom if it is for the good of the country”. Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director (research) at the Institute of Policy Studies, said it was not that promising to start talks with “terms and conditions dictated”, where parties are told certain personalities may have to step aside.  “If you’re saying you want to build a coalition that is inclusive, then you might want to start off by laying on the table what are some things that (all) agree with,” she said. Still, Prof Hussin said party veterans should agree to give way to younger and qualified members to be fielded in elections. Mr Goh from the PPP, however, disagreed that egos would get in the way. “If we are all egomaniacs, we won’t be sitting on the same table … All the leaders have their differences in their ideologies, policy-wise and how things should be done, but I do not think they are so egoistic as to say they can do it all by themselves,” he said. We understand that we cannot do it alone and we need to unite and depend on each other for our future success. Mr Goh, for one, said he has no qualms taking a backseat. “The back-end is as important as the front … I do not see anything bad about that,” he said. COMMON VISION, IDENTITY VITAL While the nitty-gritty of the proposed coalition is still to be ironed out, analysts and politicians said that uniting behind a single vision and identity will be key to achieving any success. The parties need to agree on a “conscientious” pooling of resources and a united electoral strategy, said Singapore Management University (SMU) law lecturer Eugene Tan. Mr Spencer Ng, secretary-general of the NSP, said working towards the same goal was the “fundamental cornerstone” if the parties were to fight more effectively at the ballot box. A common vision, said Asst Prof Woo, is also important so that the coalition can transcend the personality politics that has thus far characterised the country's opposition landscape. “The lack of a common vision will only damage the coalition’s credibility to potential voters,” he added. Singaporeans First secretary-general Tan Jee Say said that the seven parties have met to discuss several issues such as the cost of living, minimum wage and foreign worker inflows. He also acknowledged that the parties will have to reach a “compromise” and adopt a “give-and-take spirit” to form a successful coalition. As long as the parties agree on the core issues to tackle, peripheral differences “will not matter as much”, he said. Mr Goh said the parties concur on many issues, including the need to cut ministerial salaries and to stem increases in the Goods and Services Tax — which is set to rise from 7 per cent to 9 per cent between 2021 and 2025. “Fundamentally, we feel that the PAP should not be in power anymore,” said Mr Goh, claiming that the PAP government is not running the country as well as it used to be.  Political analyst Felix Tan, an associate lecturer with SIM Global Education, said the proposed coalition must go beyond just being “against the ruling party”. Clear policies and directions will be key to convincing voters, especially as the extent of change the coalition can effect is still in question, he said. More than a common vision, the parties will have to forge a shared identity, analysts said. Party identities will be diminished in the process, said Asst Prof Woo. Party leaders said that this was not a huge concern and they will work towards adopting a common logo and banner under which they will contest elections. Said NSP’s Mr Ng: If the coalition really comes into existence, it’s only natural that we will contest under one party and one logo. A clear agenda and arrangement under which the coalition speaks and campaigns as one will also help it to draw candidates, said Mr Tan from Singaporeans First. TALENT CRUNCH The proposed coalition also needs to focus on creating a steady pipeline of talent to ensure it stays relevant and viable for the long haul, said analysts. Political parties, including PAP, face a perennial challenge of getting suitable candidates to step forward. Among the opposition parties, WP has the strongest brand name and would be the natural choice for those aspiring to join the opposition, analysts noted. Asst Prof Woo said that parties in the proposed alliance are presently unequal in their ability to attract and retain talent. RP, for example, has had little success, with members coming and going in quick succession. By contrast, SDP has fared better, he added. Indeed, most of the parties face a dearth of talent, said SIM’s Dr Tan, and have not demonstrated the tenacity to seek out new blood or keep existing members. SMU’s Assoc Prof Tan said the parties have a long way to go in making a compelling case on why any budding politician should opt for them. One reason the smaller parties face this difficulty is that they tend to go into “political hibernation” after elections. Agreeing, Dr Bilveer Singh, a political scientist with NUS, said the parties should raise their visibility to woo talent. They cannot just be “fly-by-night” parties, but ought to capitalise on social media to scout potential candidates — an area in which they are lagging behind right now. Notwithstanding the concerns over talent, some opposition leaders remained sanguine. Mr Tan from Singaporeans First said the discussions sparked by the proposed coalition could inspire those who are ready to step forward. “With every election, there will always be new people coming up, people who are older, and ready for a change,” he added. PPP’s Mr Goh said parties of the proposed alliance were not short on talent, with banking and finance professionals and former top civil servants in their ranks, for instance. The parties are also looking to Dr Tan Cheng Bock to serve as a draw for prospective candidates. “Having the leadership of Dr Tan Cheng Bock, I hope more talented Singaporeans are willing enough to step out of their comfort zones to really fight for what is right and beneficial for the country,” said NSP’s Mr Ng. When approached, Dr Tan declined to be interviewed. IMPACT OF MAJOR PARTIES’ ABSENCE Despite the optimism of the opposition leaders involved, the effort to form a new coalition is hamstrung from the start by the absence of WP and SPP. Both parties were invited to the working lunch where the idea was mooted, but did not attend. SPP chairman Lina Chiam said that her party is focusing its efforts on intensive ground engagement to gauge and understand the sentiments of Singaporeans. Responding to media queries, the WP had maintained that its focus was on building itself up to better serve Singaporeans. WP’s aversion towards working with other opposition parties is well known, with former WP chief Low Thia Khiang making it clear previously that having all opposition parties band together as one political force was an “unworkable concept”. Mr Low stepped down as party chief earlier this year to make way for new blood. But its stance towards opposition unity is unlikely to change under new secretary-general Pritam Singh, experts have said. The absence of WP — which is the only opposition party with a presence in Parliament — would lower the proposed coalition’s chances of success, analysts said. Asst Prof Woo pointed out that it would, however, not have made sense for the WP to participate. Its political values and ideologies differ from those of key coalition members, such as the SDP. SIM’s Dr Tan reiterated that the WP and the SPP have established identities and manifestos, and are clear about who and what they stand for. Joining the coalition would diminish their influence, he said. Nonetheless, Prof Hussin said the alliance could still receive considerable support without the two main opposition parties if its leadership is united and credible, and its programmes are seen as relevant and timely. Assoc Prof Tan from SMU felt that the non-involvement of WP and SPP will not matter much as long as the opposition parties avoid being mired in three-cornered fights, which will split the opposition vote. Still, some opposition members are holding out hope that both parties could come on board. Mr Goh said discussions with WP and SPP are ongoing via various channels. While he believes it would be best if the WP decides to step in, he noted that “maybe we should let them be” as the party already has a presence in Parliament. “It’s not easy to win seats from the PAP, but whether they can hold on to them ... that’s their problem.” Opposition figure Ravi Philemon, a former SPP candidate, said that while some parties may be non-committal now, it is hard to tell how things will pan out come election time. “The opposition parties always have a roundtable discussion just before the election is announced and constituencies are drawn up. We may see a coalition (coming together) at that time,” he added. ‘IF WE DON’T CHANGE, THE RESULTS WON’T CHANGE’ With the proposed coalition beset with great challenges and what seems to be a Herculean task ahead, few people outside the opposition circles are convinced that it would take off. SIM’s Dr Tan reiterated that for several parties in the proposed coalition, “their popularity and influence in domestic politics are waning completely”. “So their relevance is … called into question in the first place. Coming together will, perhaps, allow them to be in the minds of Singaporeans,” he added. Call it what one will, but PPP’s Mr Goh — who has had his fair share of electoral setbacks — said the effort to come together stemmed from the realisation among the smaller opposition parties that they can no longer go it alone. “If we continue to do things (as we did) in the past, we will not get different results,” he said. “The fact is that our fortunes and destinies are linked … We cannot do without each other.” He added: “If you don’t try, you won’t know”. “It cannot be worse than the status quo.” In a crowded and fragmented opposition landscape, Assoc Prof Tan said the stakes are high for some of the parties involved. The proposed coalition could be their last throw of the dice.  “The parties may have no alternative as they have been marginal players in the last and previous GEs. If they don't make headway, then the next GE might see them consigned to political irrelevance,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/opposition-parties-coalition-tan-cheng-bock-sdp-dpp-ppp-10592898"}, {"datetime": "07 Aug 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["social media", "mental health", "psychology", "shopping"], "author": "Hillbun Ho", "title": "Commentary: Unhealthy culture of consumerism on social media fueling anxiety and low self-esteem", "content": " SYDNEY: Posting images on social media when we buy new clothes, eat out or purchase the latest gadget may seem harmless enough. But this consumption-oriented sharing may be undermining both our bank balance and our mental well-being. Research has found that this sort of social media engagement is linked in some people to greater anxiety, lower self-esteem and an increased likelihood of excessive spending. Around 40 per cent of the world’s population uses social media, with young people spending the greatest amount of time online. So understanding the influence of social media on health and well-being is critical to reducing potential harm. SOCIAL COMPARISON We surveyed 900 Singaporean university students aged 17 to 24 about their social media activities, to explore whether sharing product information had an influence on well-being. On platforms like Facebook and Instagram everyone looks happy: Enjoying holidays, going to fancy restaurants, buying luxury goods and clothes. We were curious to understand whether this glossy portrayal has a psychological impact on social media users. Previous research has looked at the impact of time spent on social media, but our research specifically examined the link between consumer-based content – such as posts about products or shopping experiences – and well-being. Our survey was conducted face to face at several college campuses. Participants voluntarily reported their behaviours related to social media usage, peer comparison, well-being and spending levels.  This data allowed us to assess the impact of participants’ sharing of consumption-related content on well-being, while controlling for demographics and media usage habits. Findings suggest that when young adults engage in social media, creating and sharing content about products, it can trigger a social comparison process. In the end, this hurts their psychological well-being, lowering their self-esteem and increasing anxiety levels. Feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem and anxiety in some cases led to uncontrollable spending sprees – seemingly in an effort to close the gap between the students’ own lives and what they see in their news feeds. While Singaporean culture has a strong focus on material life and peer comparison, the results are also applicable to social media users around the world, particularly young people. Of particular concern is the link between consumption-oriented sharing and risky spending behaviour, including higher credit card debt. Just sharing general experiences does not seem to have the same impact. HEALTHY PARENTAL RELATIONSHIPS HELP CURB THE PROBLEM Negative impacts were more common in students who felt that materialistic possessions and financial success are “very important”. But those who said they had a good relationship with their parents were less affected. Students who told us that they have a close, healthy relationship with their parents, using self-rated measures of attachment, support and warmth, did not suffer the same feelings of inferiority. Nor did they succumb to the behaviour that this can trigger. The research has implications for government policy and awareness programmes for young people. We are keen to conduct more of such research, to better understand ways to help young people develop self-regulation and resilience. The study also has ramifications for marketers because of what it says about the potentially negative impact of marketing products through social media “influencers” – people like beauty and fashion bloggers with large social media followings who are given free products or paid to endorse brands online.

Others prefer jobs that pay more. This has led to a dearth of technicians with about 2,000 of them servicing more than 63,000 lifts in Singapore. Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed last year, 1,000 jobs for lift technicians will be created by 2020. Those in the industry told Channel NewsAsia that an “uplifting” for lift technicians is long overdue. That will happen soon.  A progressive wage model (PWM) is planned for them, announced National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Secretary General Ng Chee Meng in his National Day message on Jul 31. Lift technicians will be the fourth group of workers to benefit from PWM which aims is to increase the salaries of workers through the enhancement of skills and improving productivity. The progressive wage model has been made mandatory for workers in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors which are mostly outsourced services. LOW SALARY, SLOW PROGRESSION, UNATTRACTIVE WORK A survey by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), showed that fresh NITEC graduates entering the lift industry earn a monthly salary of between S$1,200 and S$1,500. Progression is slow, said former lift technician Kenneth Khoo. He left his job three years ago after a 10-year career because of the low pay. He began his career as a lift technician with a starting pay of S$1,300 which grew to “around S$3,000 plus” when he left as a lift engineer. “Generally the career progression is quite slow but I was lucky because I had a diploma certificate. For most local technicians they hold the NITEC certificate or for Malaysians, the upper secondary Form 5 certificate,” he added. Mr Khoo added that some older technicians have it worse. “There are a lot of old lift technicians. Some work for almost 20 to 30 years and they still get S$2,000-plus currently. If they had other choices, I think they will leave this industry also,” said Mr Khoo. Engineer Seah Siew Chye, 41, is another who left the lift company he worked for because of the low pay. He said his technician co-workers have done the same as well. “It has always been difficult to find young technicians to join the industry. Even if companies have gotten young technicians, it’s a high chance that they have left the industry,” he said. He explained that there are two types of lift technicians - those who specialise in project work such as lift installations, and those who work on servicing lifts. The former is considered more highly skilled but there are few takers. “The installation side of it is more rugged. Most people tend to shun the construction industry, and lift installation is tied to the construction industry,” Mr Seah said.  Zul Lim, who works as a sales and marketing consultant for Lift Works, agreed that it is harder to find technicians who can perform installation work because they need to be very knowledgeable about the lift systems they are installing. “They are assembling the lift from scratch compared to someone just doing the normal oiling adjustments and change of spare parts,” Mr Lim said. “After they learn the basics from school, they have to do on-the-job training and learn a bit more about our specific brands and how to install it when they join the company,” Mr Lim said. The company has about 30 local lift technicians and struggle to employ more due to the small pool of lift technicians available locally. The company has had to turn down business opportunities due to the manpower crunch, he added. ATTRACTING, RETAINING TALENT Companies like Schindler Lifts and Otis Singapore have implemented their own wage ladders similar to the PWM for their lift technicians. Schindler, for example, uses a belting system to sort the competency level of its lift technicians, service director Nima Bahadori told Channel NewsAsia. It starts with \"white belt\" for those with little to no experience and progresses to \"black belt\" for those who have chalked up a wealth of experience. “You come in as a white belt and you get assessed according to certain criteria. Then you progress to yellow belt then to a green belt. Each one of these stages is linked with salary adjustments, basically to reward you for your achievement and skill level,” Mr Bahadori said. The belting system, which has been in place for at least 10 years, has paid off in retaining talented lift technicians, he added. Retention rates for new hires are “quite good” after they have seen and experienced what the job is all about, Mr Bahadori said. Mr Bahadori said he expects the PWM to be a “first step” in attracting Singaporeans into the industry. “It’s getting them to consider this vocation in the first place,” he said. “We would still like to see more Singaporeans entering into these roles because still, we have a high dependence on foreigners. What the PWM does, because it’s not just about wage systems, but also supports in trying to make the industry more attractive to them,” he said. Otis Singapore’s managing director Greg Nagle said the company has a “comprehensive” training strategy for employees' development. It also offers full sponsorship should employees want to further their learning with accredited universities. One employee who has benefitted is foreman Chuah Cheng Siong, who started as a lift tester 34 years ago. “I have made good career progression with Otis and [was] given the opportunity to work across both construction and maintenance operations. I started off as a junior tester and made steady progressions throughout my career,” Mr Chuah said. SERVICE BUYERS HAVE TO FOCUS ON OUTCOMES INSTEAD OF PRICES As part of PWM, outcome-based sourcing practices were recommended for the cleaning, security and landscape sectors. Service buyers are asked to consider awarding contracts based on performance and quality instead of the asking price. Priecyllia Tio, who has been with the lift industry for more than 15 years, said that service buyers have to agree to higher tender prices when PWM is implemented. “The current issue is with the market, the competition of prices,\" Ms Tio said. “It’s very difficult to increase [price]. Increase S$20 also bargain until want to die. Can you imagine? If everybody wants it cheap, then the technicians will suffer even further,” she added. Agreeing, Mr Khoo said: “The bidding prices for projects will be higher if PWM is implemented for lift technicians to sustain the increment of the salary.” “I think the salary part is the most important for lift technicians out of the PWM. They need to be seen as professionals. In other countries like Australia or United States, they get more respect. They are paid quite well. Lift technicians in Singapore are not,” Mr Khoo said. TECHNOLOGY TO HELP MANPOWER SHORTAGE While much of the work done by lift technicians today continues to be labour-intensive, Mr Bahadori said that there is space for technology to fill in for manpower shortages. Schindler is among various lift companies exploring smart, connected lifts powered by the Internet of Things. Such lifts come with sensors and analytics to update lift companies with information on their maintenance schedule instead of relying on logbooks. It also provides maintenance crew with information on how frequently the lifts are used and their passenger loads. With newer lifts equipped with sensors, Mr Bahadori said that they can issue clear instructions to technicians instead of just having prescriptive time-based work.  “We can be more specific and say, ‘Actually your time is best spent to do these specific tasks because that’s what the elevator is telling us’,” he said. With old lifts, technicians typically respond to a faulty lift equipment by troubleshooting to find the problem. Melvin Yong, who chairs the Sectoral Tripartite Committee (STC) for the lift and escalator industry, said that the committee is working on implementing a PWM for the industry to benefit all lift technicians. “More details will be released in the STC report in the coming weeks,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lift-technicians-maintenance-salary-progression-10591320"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 09:04PM", "tags": ["Heng Sweet Keat", "innovation"], "author": "Michelle Teo", "title": "Each part of the economy can play a role in promoting innovation: Heng Swee Keat", "content": " SINGAPORE: The continued push for innovation requires an ecosystem that allows for collaboration, and each part of the economy has a role to play, said Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat on Monday (Aug 6).

At the moment, only 108,000 household and 9,500 business accounts in Jurong have the option to switch to an electricity retailer other than SP Group, under a pilot launch of the Open Electricity Market (OEM) put in place since Apr 1.  Authorities earlier said that a nationwide rollout will take place in the second half of this year. Noting that this timeline remains on track, Mr Chan said more details will be shared in the coming months. The information was part of a written response to a parliamentary question filed by Member of Parliament Desmond Choo on Monday (Aug 6) about the Government's plans to further liberalise the energy market. The progressive introduction of competition into the local power market is one of the steps taken by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) to improve price competitiveness here, added Mr Chan. Given Singapore’s reliance on imported fuel to meet its energy needs, electricity prices in Singapore are largely swayed by movements in the global energy markets. Natural gas accounts for about 95 per cent of local electricity generation.  He said: “EMA has progressively introduced competition into our electricity market since the 1990s, so that companies would strive to be more cost-effective and offer better service in competing for customers.”  For instance, larger businesses have been allowed since 2001 to go shopping for electricity, instead of buying solely from SP Group at the regulated tariff. The Government is also looking to diversify Singapore’s electricity generation sources so as to reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global fuel prices.  Mr Chan highlighted initiatives, such as the JTC’s SolarRoof project, as part of a plan to raise solar adoption in Singapore to 350 megawatt peak (MWp) by 2020 and 1 gigawatt peak (GWp) beyond 2020.  Adoption of solar power here has grown from 0.4 MWp in 2008 to around 145 MWp at the end of 2017.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/open-electricity-market-to-be-extended-to-rest-of-singapore-from-10594190"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 08:00PM", "tags": [], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "About S$10m given to 9 TACs to upgrade internal capabilities as of June 2018: MTI", "content": " SINGAPORE: About S$10 million has been given out by Enterprise Singapore to nine trade associations and chambers (TACs) as of the end of June as part of a capability upgrading scheme, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Aug 6).  More TACs are expected to tap on the scheme over the next few years, added Mr Chan in a written response to a parliamentary question from Nominated Member of Parliament Thomas Chua, who asked for an update of the Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus (LEAD+) programme.  Introduced during Budget 2016, the LEAD+ programme encourages TACs to raise their internal competencies so as to champion industry transformation more effectively. Earlier this year, it was consolidated into a single enhanced LEAD programme together with other grants for TAC initiatives. With a budget of about S$115 million from 2016 to 2020, TACs can receive more help to strengthen their leadership and secretariat teams, improve organisational processes, as well as deliver new and value-added services to their members. The enhanced LEAD programme also covers all areas previously supported under LEAD+, including the secondment of public officers.  Mr Chan said more than 10 public officers have been seconded to the TACs before Budget 2016 to drive the implementation of key programmes, such as the SME Talent Programme and SME Centres.  Since then, three more officers have been seconded to the TACs and more of such arrangements will be facilitated, he added.  With extensive business networks and an in-depth understanding of industry needs and growth opportunities, Mr Chan said TACs are able to complement efforts by government agencies to support and reach out to a wide pool of enterprises.  “Our TACs play important roles to help companies transform their operations, enhance their competitiveness and capture new growth opportunities in domestic and overseas markets.  “As we move into a new phase of economic development, we must continue to evolve and strengthen the partnership between the Government and TACs,” he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/about-s-10m-given-to-9-tacs-to-upgrade-internal-capabilities-as-10594174"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 06:53PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Father of three found guilty of sexually assaulting nine-year-old boy during Halloween sleepover", "content": " SINGAPORE: A father of three boys was convicted on Monday (Aug 6) of sexually assaulting a nine-year-old boy during a Halloween sleepover in 2015. The 48-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order, was a foreign executive. The boy was a friend of the accused's youngest son and was at his home on Oct 31, 2015, for a Halloween party. The boy and the man's son went to bed at about 10.30pm, with the victim on the top bunk and the man's son on the lower bunk. At about 11.15pm, the accused entered the room. He stood on the lower bunk, where his son was sleeping, and molested the victim. He returned a short while later and sexually assaulted the boy by performing oral sex on him. The boy later said he felt ill and wanted to go home, and told his father what happened when he came to pick him up. The boy's father confronted the accused and made a police report a few days later. DEFENCE SAID VICTIM COULD HAVE BEEN HALLUCINATING FROM HALLOWEEN CANDY The man was found guilty in high court on Monday of two charges of sexual assault, and one charge of aggravated outrage of modesty of the boy. During his trial, the man's defence lawyer Selva K Naidu said it was \"unsafe to convict solely based on a young witness' testimony\". He added that the victim had been \"sexualised from a young age in his school environment\", and that the scary environment of Halloween on top of the candies he had consumed could have led to hallucinations. Deputy Public Prosecutor Christina Koh called his defence \"misleading\" and \"full of victim-shaming tactics\". \"The victim's testimony was cogent and coherent. He did not embellish or evade,\" she said. She said the accused, on the other hand, was \"evasive and dishonest\". BAIL REVOKED, BUT GAG ORDER ON ACCUSED REMAINS Ms Koh called for the accused's bail to be revoked, calling him a flight risk as he was now \"rootless\" in Singapore, with no car, family, house or employment here. Justice See Kee Oon agreed and revoked his bail. However, when Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Lai asked for the gag order on the accused's name to be lifted, Justice See declined. He agreed with the defence that there was a significant risk that the victim could be identified through the man's sons if he was identified. The case will be heard again in court this Friday for sentencing. While his case was being heard, the accused was slapped with five additional charges in the State Courts relating to another eight-year-old boy. He was accused of showing a pornographic video to the boy in 2011, the same year when he allegedly molested him and sexually assaulted him.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/father-of-three-guilty-sexually-assaulting-boy-halloween-10593870"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 06:48PM", "tags": ["crime", "scam"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Cases of investment scams doubled over 2015 to 2017 due to rise of unregulated online platforms", "content": " SINGAPORE: There has been an increase in the number of investment scams reported in Singapore, doubling from about 200 to more than 400 cases annually from 2015 to 2017, due to the emergence of unregulated online platforms. Thirty people have been charged by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) since 2015 for their roles in 14 of such scams. These figures were revealed by Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam on Monday (Aug 6) in a written reply to a parliamentary question from Member of Parliament Ong Teng Koon. On why there is a comparatively lower number of successfully prosecuted cases to the police reports made, Mr Shanmugam said that a significant proportion of investment frauds are committed remotely by syndicates operating in foreign countries.  Alleged investment assets, such as distressed properties and agricultural products like seaweed farms, are also located overseas, making it difficult for the police to track down conclusively.  \"Also, one investment scam may have multiple victims, resulting in many police reports. Some losses alleged in reports are not due to scams, but the ups and downs of the market,\" said Mr Shanmugam. Members of the public usually come across these unregulated online trading platforms, which allow trades across a wide range of products, through online advertisements, emails, as well as unsolicited phone calls and messages.  Operators are usually based outside of Singapore and payments are made directly to overseas bank accounts. In a joint statement issued in May, the CAD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had urged the public to exercise “extreme caution” when dealing with these platforms after seeing a rise in the number of complaints over the past year. A total of 142 reports from consumers who lost S$7.8 million from trading on unlicensed platforms were made last year, up from 40 reports in 2016.  As part of the ongoing review of the Penal Code, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Law are reviewing the need to further strengthen Singapore’s legislative levers against fraud offences.  The police will also continue to work closely with foreign law enforcement counterparts to crack down on overseas syndicates targeting Singaporeans.

Occupations involved range from architects and engineers, business professionals, IT professionals and managers with many being paid between S$3,000 and S$10,000, Mrs Teo added. Under the framework, all companies are required to consider Singaporeans fairly for job opportunities.  \"Firms on the FCF watchlist will have their Employment Pass applications scrutinised and consequently experience longer processing times,\" Mrs Teo said.

Jeremy Low Wei Hao, 20, admitted to two charges of the use of criminal force intending to outrage the modesty of an 11-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl respectively. Another charge of committing an obscene act with a child will be taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that on April 13 last year, the boy, who cannot be named due to a gag order, was walking home from school. The boy, who was in his school uniform, took a route through some HDB flats. Low had been following him as he had \"an urge\" to molest him, court documents said. While the boy was looking at his handphone, as he walked past a lift lobby at a block of flats, Low accosted him from the back and molested him repeatedly. The boy was shocked and tried to struggle, but this was ineffective as Low was more than a head taller than him. Low pulled the boy backwards by his backpack and the boy fell onto the floor, where Low molested him again.  Low then fled while the boy was still on the floor. The young boy returned home and told his mother what happened, and she called the police. Police officers responding to the incident spotted Low, who matched the description given by the victim, and he was detained shortly after. Low claimed that he had seen a newspaper article on a child molester, and this had ignited \"his urge to touch young children\", court documents said. HE MOLESTED A FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHILE ON BAIL After Low was charged for this offence and was out on court bail, he molested another young child. On Oct 29 last year, at about 2pm, the second victim was in a storeroom at her mother's shop downtown. The girl, who was in kindergarten, was in the room alone, drawing pictures. Low was in the vicinity to meet his lawyer for his first offence. When he walked past, he noticed the girl through a glass window of the shop and had an urge to molest her. He entered the shop and molested the girl. He also made her perform a sexual act on him. While he was doing this, he told the girl that \"it was 'OK'\". The girl did not shout, although she felt scared. At this point, her mother came over and saw Low, who fled upon seeing her. She observed that her daughter was shocked. She then called the police and informed security. Low was arrested later. PROSECUTION CALLS FOR REFORMATIVE TRAINING Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong on Monday asked for reformative training for Low. Reformative training is a more severe punishment than probation and can be given to offenders aged below 21. It requires the offender to be detained in a structured environment for at least 18 months. Ms Wong said that there was some degree of force in Low's encounter with the boy, and pointed out that his victims were very young children, who reacted with shock and fear. She referenced a report by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) that indicated that Low was diagnosed with paedophilic disorder as well as mild autistic spectrum disorder. However, while there was a contributory link between his paedophilic disorder and his offences, there was none between his autism and his offences, Ms Wong said. Dr Hatta Santoso Ong, senior resident of IMH's Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry, said in his report that Low had been seen at the IMH outpatient clinic in August last year for reported urges to \"hug and molest young boys\". The report further documented that Low \"felt satisfied\" about the knowledge he gained from a news report on a child molester. \"For the next six months, he would re-read the article on an almost daily basis, and felt aroused after each reading,\" said the report. ACCUSED SUFFERS FROM ASPERGER'S: DEFENCE Low's defence lawyer said Low has been very remorseful and contrite, and cited a different doctor - Dr Tommy Tan from Novena Psychiatry Clinic. The defence said Low was suffering from Asperger's syndrome, and has from a young age.  He was caught in a female toilet in secondary school and caught watching pornography in polytechnic. Low graduated last year and was unemployed at the time of the offences. His defence lawyer added that on the day that Low molested the girl, he had forgotten to take his medicine. He said that Low had received several commendations when he was a student, including one from his employer during his internship, and another by his teacher on his design skills. He lives with his older brother and mother, while his older sister is married. His two siblings have been \"very active in interacting with him\" after the incidents, the defence said. Low's father has died. PROSECUTION ASKS COURT NOT TO RELY ON PSYCHIATRIC REPORT BY DEFENCE The prosecution called for the court not to rely on Dr Tan's report, saying that there was insufficient reasoning and justification in the report. The report also did not mention Low's paedophilic disorder, and \"was partisan\" as Dr Tan urged the court to ask for a mandatory treatment order, said the prosecutor. \"That is not his role as a psychiatrist to plead for the accused,\" said Ms Wong. \"This shows the report is partisan and should not be relied upon.\" She added that even though Low's social functioning was lower than his peers, it was clear from his own defence that he could function as he held an internship and was a scout leader. District Judge May Mesenas adjourned the case for sentencing to next week and called for probation and reformative training reports. For using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the girl, Low can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments. For outraging the modesty of the boy with wrongful restraint, he can be jailed for between three years and 10 years and caned.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/young-man-pleads-guilty-to-molesting-boy-11-and-five-year-old-10593606"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 05:37PM", "tags": [], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "No plans to extend anti-littering laws to private estates like condominiums: Amy Khor ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Government has no plans to amend legislation and extend anti-littering laws to private estates such as condominiums, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6). Responding to a question from MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC Liang Eng Hwa, Dr Khor said that doing so would likely elicit a negative reaction, such as the laws being intrusive. Mr Liang had asked whether the National Environment Agency (NEA) could extend the deployment of surveillance cameras beyond HDB estates to high-rise private estates to carry out enforcement against high-rise littering. Dr Khor explained that the prohibition against littering under the Environmental Public Health Act applies only to publicly accessible places. Private estates such as Executive Condominiums (ECs) and private strata-titled condominiums are not regarded as such a place in law, as access to these places are restricted. This means, she said, that NEA is in turn unable to carry out enforcement against littering incidents carried out in these estates. However, she noted that when approached by a condominium’s management committee for assistance in the area of high-rise littering, NEA explores ways to collaborate with them to educate and advise residents against doing so. She added that many condominiums already have by-laws that prohibit littering within their estates. “If all else fails, the management committee can apply to the courts to enforce these by-laws against errant residents,” she said. “While the process may be challenging, MCSTs can nonetheless turn to these options if all other means at reaching out to the errant resident fails, including even community mediation.” Ultimately, Dr Khor stressed that home owners in private estates have the autonomy to govern and manage the shared private spaces in a responsible manner. “For this to happen, residents should come together to encourage and influence acceptable social behaviour in their communities,” she said.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-plans-to-extend-anti-littering-laws-to-private-estates-like-10593708"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 05:31PM", "tags": ["HSR", "travel", "transport", "Malaysia"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore's Transport Ministry says no date fixed for High-Speed Rail talks with Malaysia", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: While Malaysia's Economic Affairs Minister Mohamad Azmin Ali had suggested that a discussion will take place between Singapore and Malaysia on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Railway (HSR) in August, Singapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT) clarified on Monday night (Aug 6) that no meeting has been scheduled.

These would include preventive and early detection, providing effective cooling for those with heat injury as well as the rapid evacuation of such cases, as recommended by an external panel looking at its heat injury management processes. This was announced by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen as he delivered a statement in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6) regarding training deaths during National Service.  The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) had in May commissioned an external review panel – which includes medical professionals from Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital - on heat injury management to examine the SAF’s heat injury policies and processes.  This was after the death of Corporal First Class (CFC) Dave Lee on Apr 30 nearly two weeks after \"displaying signs of heat injury\" following a fast march at Bedok Camp. In its report that was presented to Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Jul 23, the panel found that the SAF’s heat injury measures were “generally sound and aligned with prevalent industry and foreign military practices”. The army’s Training Safety Regulations (TSR) on hot weather operations were broadly similar to regulations by advanced army forces like those in the US, UK and NATO, it added. The organisation last did a major review of its heat injury prevention measures in 2013 to address a rising trend of heat injuries, and “succeeded in reversing the trend”, the panel observed. In its report, the total number of heat injuries declined from 27 in 2012/2013 to 20 in 2017/2018. However, heat stroke cases – while dropping from eight to five in the same period – saw a rise from zero cases in 2015/2016 to five in 2017/2018.  SAF, the panel said, has put in place a broad range of heat injury measures and invested “substantial resources” to prevent and treat heat injuries such as in research studies, improved load-bearing vests and uniforms, specialised cooling equipment and a responsive casualty evacuation system. The training provided to SAF medical officers and medics are “in line with national requirements”, it added.  Colonel Tong Yi Chuen, head of Army Safety Inspectorate, said in a media briefing that from its investigations of the number of heat stroke and heat exhaustion cases over the past few years, it has found that the “causal factor for most of these cases is highly motivated soldiers”.  That said, the five-strong panel made several observations and recommendations that it bundled under three key themes: ENHANCING PREVENTIVE MEASURES On the point about SAF’s heat injury prevention measures, the panel was informed that the US Army and Australian Defence Force, for one, has implemented a cooling measure known as Arm Immersion Cooling System (AICS) for soldiers training in hot conditions to immerse their arms in cool water of a recommended 10 degrees Celsius during rest breaks.   SAF, too, has promoted this measure as a best practice and used selectively during strenuous training in units like the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC), Specialist Cadet School and Officer Cadet School, the panel noted, and recommended for this to be implemented across the whole SAF. On its part, SAF said AICS has been found to be effective in cooling body core temperature as water removes heat more effectively than air. As such, it will be implementing AICS across the army in phases from this month, starting with BMTC. This will be mandatory for all fast marches and route marches spanning 12km and more, although SAF will continue to evaluate its use for other activities like the Standard Obstacle Course (SOC). COL Tong also said as part of SAF’s internal reviews in the past three years, the other heat prevention measures included the introduction of the Heat Stress Monitor in 2015 to allow commanders to monitor atmospheric temperature. He also pointed to the hybrid uniform for army combat units that better help dissipates heat. REDUCING BARRIERS FOR SELF REPORTING The SAF will also be strengthening the open reporting system by more actively encouraging soldiers to report safety concerns using the Army service hotline. COL Tong said this would include emphasising to commanders about the hotline and getting them to encourage soldiers under their charge to use it where necessary. Besides phoning in their concerns, soldiers can also report via WhatsApp, Telegram or Viber, he added. He said the hotline was established since 2011, and it receives an average of 50 calls every year. Some of the calls were to inform of safety hazards while others were made by concerned parents, COL Tong added. Commander of Army Training Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Brigadier-General Kenneth Liow also stressed in the same briefing that every report made will be investigated.   This was an area highlighted by the external panel, which said in its report that many soldiers may be reluctant to opt out of training for a variety of reasons, including individual volition, peer pressure or desire to avoid weekend make-up training. “The panel’s view is supported by the army’s finding that many heat injury cases arose as a result of over-zealous soldiers pushing themselves beyond their limits,” it said in the report. “The army would need to address the barriers that are discouraging soldiers from self-reporting if they are feeling unwell.” It also recommended to expand the army’s list of risk factors that may predispose someone to heat injuries, which currently stands at 16. The additional factors, gleaned from foreign military guidelines, include: Inexperienced soldiers, alcohol intake, use of supplements and salt depletion. Chief Army Medical Officer Colonel (Dr) Edward Lo explained that while its current list of risk factors is comprehensive, the external panel’s recommendation showed that they did not want to leave any stone unturned.   PROVIDING MORE EFFECTIVE COOLING EQUIPMENT The external panel noted that Body Cooling Units (BCUs) are currently used in 30 SAF medical centres and are the main equipment used for treating heat injury casualties. They are also used in three hospitals: Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. However, while BCUs have served SAF well, the panel said research suggests newer and more effective cooling methods are available in the market. One such option is the EMCOOLS Flex.Pad, which is a portable cooling system “superior to the BCU”. SAF, in turn, has accepted the recommendation and said it will replace the current use of six ice packs to this purpose-built cooling pad as its on-site cooling measure when there are suspected heat injuries.  It said these pads cool 15 times faster than ice and 58 times faster than water, while in a study done by the SAF and DSO National Laboratories, the pads demonstrated a cooling rate of 0.12 degrees Celsius per minute, which is about four times faster than the 0.03 degrees Celsius per minute by ice packs. These pads will be implemented across SAF from August, starting with BMTC in Pulau Tekong. During a demonstration of cooling pads, Major (Dr) Teo Rui Ming said BMTC will be the first recipients as it has the “highest risk of heat injuries”. The pads are not new though, as it is used in overseas training and by the Emergency Ambulance Services, MINDEF said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/death-of-nsf-dave-lee-saf-to-enhance-prevention-management-of-10593386"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 05:04PM", "tags": ["Dave Lee", "SAF", "MINDEF", "heat injuries"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Death of NSF Dave Lee: External panel finds today’s wearables ‘not effective’ for detecting heat injury", "content": " SINGAPORE: The external panel convened by the Ministry of Defence to examine the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) heat injury policies and processes has found that the current consumer wearable technology available in the market is “not effective” for detecting heat injury. Following the death of full-time National Serviceman Dave Lee this April, there have been calls by the public for the use of wearable tech to measure a soldier’s vital signs and detect possible heat injuries earlier. To this, the panel – which includes medical professionals from Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital – said: “The panel feels that the range of consumer wearables currently available in the market would not be effective for measuring core temperature in exertional settings. “The main utility of such devices would be to monitor and improve soldier performance over time, rather than to detect heat injury.” The panel’s findings were made public following Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s statement in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6) over deaths during National Service. It did note that the SAF has commissioned two studies involving the use of wearable tech to improve heat injury management. The first seeks to accurately predict all-cause injury risks by using such tech to detect skin temperature, heart rate and changes in heart rate, the panel said. The other aims to estimate body core temperature using heart rate and chest temperature. “If successful, these projects would help overcome the current shortcomings of consumer wearables,” the panel said.

In his statement Dr Ng said: “MINDEF will await the outcome of the police investigations and Coroner’s Inquiry, as well as the Attorney-General’s Chambers' decision whether to prosecute any person in the criminal courts. \"If no criminal charges are filed, MINDEF will prosecute persons responsible for lapses in this incident in our military court,\" he added. Dr Ng also stressed that the relevant persons in this incident \"have been removed from command\". Dr Ng did not specify the names or designations of these people involved as under the Singapore Armed Forces Act, the Committee Of Inquiry (COI) is structured primarily to investigate and determine facts related to the incident and to identify causation, lapses and systemic problems which resulted in the incident. \"The COI does not deal with culpability of individuals. Specifically, to encourage disclosure and cooperation by all involved in the incident, section 8C of the SAF Act provides that no statements made to the COI shall be admissible as evidence in the court martial or for disciplinary proceedings,\" he said.   According to Dr Ng, the COI's preliminary assessment of CFC Lee’s death concluded that the likely reasons for him succumbing to heat stroke were inadequate on-site casualty management and delayed evacuation to the medical centre. ​​​​​​​He said: \"The COI opined that the significant delay from time of symptoms to evacuation could have escalated the heat injury to a heat stroke. Full-body cooling should have been instituted as soon as possible, and within 30 minutes of presentation of signs and symptoms.\" He added that the delay in evacuation was because those attending to him mistook his signs and symptoms as due to physical exhaustion, instead of heat injury. \"Though trained, they had never encountered any previous case of heat injury themselves. There were several suggestions for CFC Lee to be evacuated, but these calls were either not heard or not heeded,\" he added.  According to Dr Ng, the External Review Panel on SAF Safety flagged three areas for further emphasis based on the COI’s findings. \"First, the need to strengthen commanders’ knowledge on heat injuries and improve their decision-making processes. Second, for medics to be able to exercise their professional authority when dealing with medical issues. This includes being able to communicate effectively with commanders who are much more senior than them.   \"Third, for commanders to watch out for soldiers who are feeling unwell or are unable to cope and proactively pull them out of training before they get injured,\" Dr Ng said.  The COI will submit its final report after police investigations are complete and the coroner’s inquiry. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/death-of-nsf-dave-lee-mindef-to-prosecute-those-responsible-10592968"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 04:51PM", "tags": ["Lombok", "Indonesia", "Singapore Red Cross"], "author": "", "title": "President Halimah, PM Lee extend condolences to Indonesia over Lombok earthquake; Singapore to donate US$100,000", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong have extended condolences over the earthquake in Lombok to Indonesia President Joko Widodo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Monday (Aug 6).

CFC Lee died on Apr 30, nearly two weeks after \"displaying signs of heat injury\" in Bedok Camp following the completion of an 8km fast march, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said. \"The COI found that CFC Lee’s death was the result of heat stroke leading to multiple organ injury,\" Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in a ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6), citing preliminary findings. \"Other than this, the COI did not find any physical injury sustained, as verified by the autopsy report, nor any evidence indicating any foul play or medical negligence that caused his death. \"While the COI was unable to ascertain the direct causes which led CFC Lee to suffer from heat stroke, it noted that possible contributing causes were accumulated fatigue, insufficient rest, CFC Lee’s less than optimal state of health and his potential use of medication. \"However, the COI’s preliminary assessment was that the likely reasons for CFC Lee succumbing to heat stroke were inadequate on-site casualty management and delayed evacuation to the medical centre.\" IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF CFC LEE AFTER FAST MARCH After the fast march on Apr 18, the persons attending to CFC Lee thought that he was suffering from physical exhaustion, Dr Ng said, citing the COI's findings. His pulse was assessed to be normal and his skin felt cold to the touch, but his temperature was not taken, the COI found. The first-aid that was administered comprised the removal of CFC Lee’s equipment, unbuttoning his uniform, applying ice packs at his vital points, pouring water on him, and giving him water. He was also given oxygen. \"However, the COI noted that the on-site cooling measures administered were inadequate, including the failure to administer an on-site IV drip, the improper placement of ice packs, and the improper use of a ground sheet,\" Dr Ng said. \"When his condition did not improve, CFC Lee was subsequently evacuated to the medical centre. However there was a significant gap between the onset of symptoms and his arrival at the medical centre.\" On arrival at the Bedok Camp Medical Centre, the COI found that CFC Lee was semi-conscious, with his temperature at 42.7 degrees Celsius.  Two bags of fast intravenous (IV) drip were administered, and he was also placed in the Body Cooling Unit for two cycles. Seeing that CFC Lee was not responding to the treatment, the Medical Officer (MO) decided to evacuate him to the Changi General Hospital (CGH), the COI's findings stated. The MO accompanied CFC Lee in a Singapore Armed Forces ambulance to CGH’s Accident and Emergency department, where he was handed over and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  His condition deteriorated and he died 12 days later. \"The COI opined that the significant delay from time of symptoms to evacuation could have escalated the heat injury to a heat stroke,\" Dr Ng said. \"Full body cooling should have been instituted as soon as possible, and within 30 minutes of presentation of signs and symptoms.\" It is not clear how long before body cooling was started after CFC Lee presented heat injury symptoms. \"The delay in evacuation resulted as the persons attending to CFC Lee mistook his signs and symptoms as due to physical exhaustion,\" Dr Ng continued. \"Though trained, they had never encountered any previous case of heat injury themselves.\" Dr Ng added that there were several calls for CFC Lee to be evacuated, but these calls were either \"not heard or not heeded\".  TRAINING SAFETY AND DISCIPLINE REGULATIONS BREACHES DAY BEFORE FAST MARCH The COI also found breaches of training safety and discipline regulations on Apr 17, the day before the heat stroke occurred. It discovered breaches of the Army’s Training Safety Regulations (TSR) for a cardiovascular physical exercise that CFC Lee took part in. For this exercise, soldiers had to run six laps of 400m each grouped according to their running ability. However, the entire company was asked to run at a common pace. \"This meant that for the first three laps, CFC Lee was asked to run at a slightly faster pace than required – of about 10 seconds faster per lap. For the next three laps, CFC Lee was allowed to run at his own pace,\" Dr Ng said.  \"The rest timing in between each lap was noted to be reduced to 1 minute, (which is) 45 seconds shorter than what was stipulated in the lesson plan. These deviations were a breach of TSR. \"The reason given was that the commanders wanted to enhance fitness and foster greater cohesion by keeping the platoon intact, and the soldiers running at the same pace, not in groups.\" As for discipline regulations, the collective punishment that was meted out to CFC Lee’s platoon later that night was also not authorised, the COI discovered. At about 9.40pm, the COI found that CFC Lee's platoon was told to fall in in their Number 4 uniform and assault bag. \"The commanders had wanted to punish the platoon collectively for the perceived lack of teamwork and the use of mobile phones after lights out, in particular by two troopers despite repeated warnings,\" Dr Ng said. Five minutes later, the commanders meted out the informal punishment in the form of physical exercises, which comprised bear crawls, sprints, leopard crawls, as well as push-ups and crunches. The commanders also had water poured over the troopers from their water bottles and jerry can. The session ended with the troopers reciting the Guards Creed a few times in a high kneel position.  The entire session lasted for about 30 to 35 minutes, and the platoon was eventually sent back to their bunks at about 10.25pm to wash up and had lights out by 10.45pm. The troopers were also instructed by commanders not to switch on the lights in their bunks. \"The COI noted that the commanders did not seek prior approval for the conduct of this informal punishment or inform their superiors after the punishment,\" Dr Ng said. \"While the majority of the troopers interviewed opined that the commanders were good commanders who demanded high standards, this punishment was unauthorised. \"The COI found that the conduct of the unauthorised informal punishment compromised the seven hours of uninterrupted rest as the trainees had 6 hours, 15 minutes instead. \"Less sleep could be one of the factors which caused CFC Lee to have more fatigue before participating in the fast march.\" CONDUCT OF FAST MARCH IN LINE WITH LESSON PLAN AND REGULATIONS The COI also found that conduct of the fast march was in line with the lesson plan and relevant regulations, Dr Ng said. \"CFC Lee had undergone the requisite build-up training prior to the 8km fast march, and all measures to prevent heat injuries according to the TSR had been complied with,\" he added. These measures include the temperature-taking regime, hydration regime, water supply, work-rest cycle based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, and rest management, \"except that CFC Lee and his platoon did not have the requisite seven hours of sleep\". When asked follow-up questions on whether the COI had determined why the soldiers did not admit to having fewer than seven hours of sleep, Dr Ng said \"from what I can recollect, they didn't give specific reasons\". \"One surmises that they wanted to do it because they wanted to carry on with their training,\" he added. \"You've got to make it second nature for the trainees to say this is for my own self-protection or my buddy. I'm going to tell on you if you didn't do it because I'm going to protect you. \"We will require at this stage of ours, where we have the regulations but we're not sure everybody follows it, that we need everybody to play their part to achieve zero training fatalities.\" Before the fast march, CFC Lee had his temperature taken, which was normal at 36.3 degrees Celsius, and had drunk water, the COI found. This was witnessed by his buddy, who also observed him \"to be looking well and seemed to be his usual self\". CFC Lee did not inform the Conducting Officer when the latter asked if anybody was not feeling well. This was followed by the conduct of warm-up exercises to get troopers ready for the 8km fast march. After the warm-up exercises, the fast march commenced just before sunrise with the troopers despatched in four waves, at five minute intervals. Each wave included a commander as a rear sweeper. CFC Lee was in the fourth wave. After CFC Lee completed the first 6km, he had a mandated 20-minute rest. Following that, as CFC Lee was moving off for the last 2km, he informed the commanders that he had cramps in his calf muscles.  \"They advised him to stretch his calf muscles, which he did, and encouraged him to complete the march,\" Dr Ng said. CFC Lee was the last to complete the 8km fast march in around 100 minutes, including the 20-minute break. \"Shortly after the fast march, as CFC Lee was walking from the end point of the fast march to the Support Company line, he was observed to be disoriented and immediately attended to by the commanders and the cover medics,\" Dr Ng added. OTHER FINDINGS AND PROSECUTION Besides these findings, the COI also looked into CFC Lee’s state of health prior to the fast march. While CFC Lee had no significant medical history, the COI established that he had been taking medication in the weeks prior to the fast march for acute upper respiratory tract infection.  This was after he visited a polyclinic on Mar 31, more than two weeks before the fast march. \"MINDEF will await the outcome of the Police investigations and Coroner’s Inquiry, as well as the Attorney-General’s Chambers’ decision whether to prosecute any person in the criminal courts,\" Dr Ng stated. He added that those responsible for lapses leading to the death of CFC Lee will be prosecuted in a military court if no criminal charges are filed.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/death-nsf-dave-lee-casualty-management-delayed-evacuation-10592976"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 03:37PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "cybersecurity", "cyberattack"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "SingHealth cyberattack should be taken as a warning to all organisations to review their systems: Iswaran ", "content": " SINGAPORE: All organisations should take the recent SingHealth cyberattack as a warning to review their cybersecurity system, and ensure the protection of their IT systems and databases, including personal data, Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran said on Monday (Aug 6). Delivering a ministerial statement on the incident in Parliament, Mr Iswaran stressed that this applies to all organisations, not just operators of critical information infrastructure (CII). CII refers to sectors that are responsible for the continuous delivery of essential services in Singapore, including Government, infocomm, energy and aviation.  Last month, cyberattackers stole 1.5 million SingHealth patients’ records in what was described as the \"most serious breach of personal data” in Singapore’s history. The 1.5 million individuals had their non-medical records – including their name, NRIC, address and date of birth – illegally accessed and copied in the cyberattack. About 160,000, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also had their dispensed medicines records taken. Addressing concerns that the data stolen through the SingHealth cyberattack could be used for fraudulent transactions or identity theft, Mr Iswaran emphasised that there are multiple safeguards in place to mitigate such risks. This is especially so, he said, for financial transactions and sensitive Government e-transactions. For example, all banks and insurance companies in Singapore already have two-factor authentication (2FA) for online financial services, such as making fund transfers or accessing account details. An additional authentication layer also protects higher-risk transactions such as adding a third-party payee, he added. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had last month also directed all financial institutions to take further measures.  Mr Iswaran added that all sensitive Government e-transactions have also been protected by SingPass 2FA since July 2016. But he also noted that individuals can also do their part by practising good personal data protection and cybersecurity habits. “They should ensure that their passwords, user IDs and security questions are not based on personal data, use strong passwords, enable 2FA for online transactions and watch out for fraudulent transactions and suspicious requests for personal data,” he said. In concluding his speech, Mr Iswaran emphasised that the cyberattack was “well-planned and targeted”. The Government, he said, will get to the bottom of the incident, learn from it, and further strengthen Government IT systems. But he cautioned that the risk of another cyberattack breaking through the Government’s defences cannot be completely eliminated. “Ensuring cybersecurity is a ceaseless battle, like our battle against terrorism,” he said. “It involves changing technology and sophisticated perpetrators who are constantly developing new techniques and probing for fresh weaknesses.” “Therefore, even as we do our best to strengthen our IT systems, it is crucial that our people and systems remain resilient; that we are able to respond robustly and decisively to an incident, and that we constantly learn and reinforce our system.” He added that after learning and applying the lessons from the incident, Singapore must press on with its plans for a Smart Nation. “We must adapt ourselves to operate effectively and securely in the digital age, to deliver better public services, enhance our economic competitiveness, and create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-should-be-taken-as-a-warning-to-all-10593072"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 03:31PM", "tags": ["cybersecurity", "SingHealth", "cyberattack"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "SingHealth cyberattack the work of sophisticated, usually state-linked attackers: Iswaran", "content": " SINGAPORE: The cyberattack on SingHealth’s IT database in June, which resulted in the most serious breach of personal data in Singapore’s history, was “the work of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group” that are “usually state-linked”, said Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran on Monday (Aug 6).  Mr Iswaran, in delivering his ministerial statement on the incident in Parliament, said the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has done a detailed analysis of the cyberattack and determined it is by an APT group, which refers to a class of sophisticated attackers who conduct extended, carefully planned cyber campaigns to steal information or disrupt operations.  The SingHealth incident is not the only APT attack Singapore has seen, the minister said, pointing to the 2017 attack on the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).  Internationally, APT groups have also hacked the United States (US) Democratic National Committee in 2016 and the US Office of Personal Management (OPM) in 2014, which resulted in more than 20 million personnel records stolen. Mr Iswaran said the SingHealth cyber attacker had used advanced and sophisticated tools, including customised malware that was able to evade the healthcare provider’s antivirus software and security tools. Once they got into the system, they took steps to remain in the system undetected before stealing patients’ information, which included that of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  “The attack fits the profile of certain known APT groups, but for national security reasons, we will not be making any specific public attribution,” the minister said. Cybersecurity experts had earlier made similar observations, with FireEye’s Asia Pacific president Eric Hoh saying the attack was an APT and the nature of such attacks are that they are conducted by nation states using very advanced tools. He added the fact the perpetrator carried on trying to access SingHealth’s network even after detection is the “typical signature” of a nation-state actor. The minister said the Government has taken additional measures to strengthen cybersecurity defences.  He said CSA's forensic investigation team has analysed the compromised computers in the SingHealth incident and extracted pieces of data used to identify malicious activity on a network. The agency then instructed owners and regulators of critical information infrastructure (CII) to scan for such indicators and advised on possible measures to mitigate a similar incident.  It had also instructed the 11 key sectors to strengthen the security around their networks, the minister added.  Mr Iswaran said the Cybersecurity Act passed in Parliament this February gives the Government \"additional levers\" to strengthen the protection of such CIIs against cyberattacks, and CSA is currently implementing the provisions of the law. It will designate all CIIs by the end of this year, he said.  COI HAS STARTED WORK Mr Iswaran also gave an update on the Committee of Inquiry (COI), which he had appointed on Jul 24 and charged to establish the events and contributing factors leading to the cyberattack and the incident response. The COI is headed by Mr Richard Magnus, formerly chief district judge, and includes Mr Lee Fook Sun, Mr T K Udairam and Ms Cham Hui Fong.  He said the committee has started its work, including holding preparatory meetings, and will “soon” hold its first pre-inquiry conference. The minister added the Attorney-General’s Chambers will lead evidence and CSA will lead a team to conduct the investigations. The COI will conduct inquiry hearings after receiving CSA’s report, he said, adding the committee will decide which parts of the hearings can be held in public as some aspects of the inquiry will have “security implications”. The minister acknowledged that some Members of Parliament have asked whether the SingHealth cyberattack could have been prevented and what lessons have been learned, but called on their understanding to allow the committee to conduct a thorough investigation without pre-empting its findings. The committee’s report is expected by Dec 31 this year, he added. NO PUBLIC ATTRIBUTION, YET Following the ministerial statements from Mr Iswaran and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, Workers' Party MP Low Thia Khiang asked if the Government knew who is behind the SingHealth attack and whether it is willing to share the information with Singaporeans.  He also asked if the name of the hacker group, where the attack was launched, and where the overseas servers that the patient records were sent to are located can be revealed.   To these questions, Mr Iswaran reiterated that the attack fits the profile of certain known APT groups, but the Government will not be publicly naming them for national security concerns. He added that in these matters, \"whilst once can have a high level of confidence, one may not be able to have the certainty that you might need in order to specifically assign responsibility\" and the evidence may not stand up in the court of law.  The agencies involved have a \"high level of confidence\" of the people behind the hack though, he added.  \"Having said that, we don't think it serves our national interest nor is it a productive exercise for us to be making specific public attribution,\" the minister said. \"What is essential is that we diagnose the problem clearly, and take the appropriate steps and, if in the process of the COI specific attribution can be made in a manner where action can be subsequently taken up in the court of law, we will certainly consider that course of action.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-usually-state-linked-attackers-iswaran-10592762"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 03:24PM", "tags": ["Manpower", "workplace fatality", "migrant workers", "Ministry of Manpower"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "20 workplace fatalities in first half of 2018; construction sector accounts for majority of cases", "content": " SINGAPORE: There were 20 workplace fatalities in the first half of 2018, said Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6). It is slightly higher than the 19 cases in the same period last year, he said in response to questions from Members of Parliament Melvin Yong and Desmond Choo. The majority of cases came from the construction industry but recent fatal accidents were also prevalent in the manufacturing sector and in commercial diving, Mr Zaqy said. Workplace fatalities in the construction sector have declined over the last five years from 34 in 2013 to 12 in 2017. Foreigners constituted 88 per cent of the fatalities even though they comprised 75 per cent of the construction workforce, he added. A common cause of the fatalities was the use of improper work methods, Mr Zaqy said, adding that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) works with companies to raise awareness of accident risks in their workplaces. He said MOM has engaged industry associations and foreign workers, and ramped up enforcement operations to raise awareness of accident risks at their workplaces.  In May, MOM announced an additional 750 safety inspections after a spate of workplace fatalities and serious injuries. 80 per cent of these inspections have been completed, Mr Zaqy said. In addition, six stop-work orders were issued along with 164 composition fines amounting to S$188,750. \"We hope that this sends a strong message to the construction sector to be more vigilant especially since they have contributed a significant amount of fatalities to the workplaces this year,\" Mr Zaqy said.  MOM NOTIFIED ON SALARY REDUCTIONS MP Louis Ng asked about the notifications received by MOM on reducing the salaries of work permit holders.  Since 2011, employers are required to declare the basic and fixed monthly salary to MOM when applying for work permits for their prospective workers.  If employers want to reduce the salary of his worker, they can do so if they have obtained the worker's written agreement and notified MOM of the revision.  Mr Zaqy said that in the past three years, MOM has been notified of salary reductions affecting less than 2 per cent of non-domestic work permit holders per year.  Less than one in ten had their salaries reduced within one month after the work permit was issued, with about four in ten within one year. \"As explained in reply to a Parliamentary Question raised by the member on this topic last month, MOM is studying the issue and will consult with relevant stakeholders to determine the best step forward,\" Mr Zaqy said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/20-workplace-fatalities-in-first-half-of-2018-construction-10592746"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 03:20PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "cyberattack", "Gan Kim Yong"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "SingHealth cyberattack: MOH studying virtual browser solution to better protect public healthcare IT systems", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is studying and piloting a virtual browser solution for public healthcare IT systems, which will reduce the number of potential attack points, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6). “This enables users to access the Internet more safely via a set of quarantined servers,” Mr Gan said in a ministerial statement. He was responding to questions related to the SingHealth cyberattack last month from members including chairman of the government parliamentary committee of health Dr Chia Shi Lu. The cyberattack resulted in the personal particulars of 1.5 million SingHealth patients including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong being accessed and copied. Of this, 160,000 also had information on their outpatient dispensed medicines accessed. However, no phone numbers, passwords or credit card information were accessed. He added that an ongoing pilot on virtual browser was scheduled to be completed by September this year. Mr Gan said the virtual browser solution will be complemented by the deployment of Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), which will provide further defence against advanced cyberattacks. The deployment of ATP had been initiated before the SingHealth incident and is expected to be completed by end of this month, he added. “Nevertheless, given the urgency of the matter, we went ahead to implement ISS, albeit as a temporary measure,” he said.  ISS was implemented for SingHealth since July 19, and National University Health System and National Healthcare Group have done so since July 23, he said. “Many healthcare systems in other countries have found it difficult to implement ISS for practical and operational reasons,” he said, adding that healthcare systems, such as Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority and Kaiser Permanante have not adopted full ISS. Imposing ISS will limit avenues for attackers to enter and exit the healthcare clusters’ IT systems, he said, while acknowledging that ISS has “created some inconveniences and operational challenges for healthcare workers and patients”. Areas that have been affected include reading of diagnostic reports from laboratories, video consultation and assessment of suspected stroke patients at the emergency department. Waiting times for consultation may also be longer as doctors may need to access references on the internet through a separate computer.  There remain some issues not yet fully resolved, Mr Gan said, such as referrals to private sector partners, and submission and retrieval of results from screening systems.  He said these do not compromise patient care and safety, but affect the efficiency of our healthcare delivery.  “As a result of the security measures, some patients may experience a longer wait for consultations and receive their test results, as well as delays in checking their MediSave accounts or making their claims. The productivity and efficiency of our services may also be affected in some cases,” the minister added. To mitigate the challenges on the ground and allow the healthcare institutions to continue to operate safely, Mr Gan said engineers in the healthcare sector worked overnight and through the weekend to put in place temporary work-around solutions. REASON FOR DELAY IN INFORMING PUBLIC Workers' Party MP Sylvia Lim asked for the reason behind the delay in informing the public of the cyberattack. The Government confirmed the attack on July 10, and made a police report two days later. A press conference was held by the Ministries of Health, and Communications and Information on July 20 to disclose the cyberattack. In response, Mr Gan said that \"multiple streams of work\"were carrying on at the same during the 10 days. These included protecting the data, tracing to find out how the incident started, identifying the data that was compromised and patients who were affected.  As late as Jul 19, there were still malicious activities in the data system, and later that day, ISS was imposed, he added. \"When we disclosed to the public, we were quite confident that the system has been stabilised and at the same time we have sufficient information to share with the public,\" he said. This included how the incident happened, what data was compromised, and who the patients were. \"All these required time to prepare and therefore it's important for us to ensure that the information given to the public is accurate as far as we are able to ascertain.\" Additional Reporting by Fann Sim", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-moh-studying-virtual-browser-solution-10592966"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 03:17PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "cyberattack"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "SingHealth cyberattack: MOH mulling permanent Internet surfing separation for some parts of healthcare system", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is considering making temporary Internet Surfing Separation (ISS)- one of the measures used to step up security following the cyberattack on SingHealth's IT system - permanent for some parts of the public healthcare system. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the possibility of the change in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6), in a statement addressing questions from members regarding the SingHealth cyberattack last month. “Although I said ISS was a temporary measure, now that it has been implemented, we will study the impact of ISS on the ground, and determine whether we can keep it as a permanent measure, at least for some parts of our healthcare system,” he said. He acknowledged however, that the temporary ISS has caused operational issues. Areas that have been affected include reading of diagnostic reports from laboratories and video consultation and assessment of suspected stroke patients at the emergency department, he said. The team continues to be on the ground to resolve the problems that have arisen as a result of the ISS. He said some issues have not yet been fully resolved, such as referrals to private sector partners, and submission and retrieval of results from screening systems. He added that waiting times for consultation may also be longer as doctors may need to access references on the internet through a separate computer.

He also spoke about the possibility of a virtual browser solution as an alternative to the ISS. NO RETURN TO DAYS OF PAPER AND PENCIL Responding to Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira’s question on the SingHealth cyberattack’s impact on the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system, Mr Gan assured members that the NEHR is a separate system that was not affected by this cyberattack. Due to the need for the system to interface with multiple external partners, the NEHR is designed differently from the systems that were infiltrated, he said. Nevertheless, recognising that the NEHR is an important national system of significant scale, as it will eventually house key medical records for all patients, the system will be put through a “rigorous independent external review” before contribution of electronic health records is made mandatory. “We have engaged the Cyber Security Agency and PwC Singapore as independent third parties to help identify any vulnerabilities and recommend measures to address them. We must assure ourselves, users and patients that the necessary safeguards are in place, before we proceed with wider implementation of the NEHR,” he said. He cautioned however that “we should not reverse our direction in the use of technology in healthcare”. IT systems have allowed the healthcare sector to greatly improve the safety and effectiveness of patient care, he said. He gave an example of an emergency involving an unconscious patient, and how access to his medical history in the NEHR would help doctors prescribe more effective medication and treatment in a timely manner. When patients receive care beyond the hospital, integration of IT systems allows easier referrals across settings and enables better team-based care and more effective emergency response, he added. “Digitalisation, technology and use of data in healthcare have brought many benefits to patients.

Greater business and investment opportunities are also on the cards, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6). This includes better access into other CPTPP markets, especially Mexico and Canada where Singapore does not have bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). Also dubbed the TPP-11, the CPTPP was negotiated and signed on Mar 8 by Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, following the withdrawal of the United States. For a deal that looks to reduce tariffs in economies that account for 13.5 per cent of the global economy and represent 500 million people with a combined GDP of about S$13 trillion, it is expected to generate an additional S$147 billion in global income. Mr Chan said the benefits of the landmark deal will be spread across many industries and sectors in Singapore.  Goods producers based here, especially processed food, textile, and apparel manufacturers, will enjoy preferential tariffs when exporting to a CPTPP market.  Services providers will also have preferential access in a wide range of sectors. These include transport and distribution services in Australia, energy and telecommunications in Mexico, as well as professional services in Canada.  For investors, foreign equity restrictions in the private healthcare, telecommunications, courier, energy and environmental services sectors in Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam will be removed. The CPTPP will also open up government procurement projects in Malaysia, Mexico and Vietnam to foreign bidders. CPTPP A COMMITMENT TO FREE, OPEN TRADE: CHAN Beyond specific business opportunities, Mr Chan said the CPTPP establishes a common set of enforceable rules that govern trade and investment in the 21st century. These include rules in the areas of e-commerce, innovative industries and provisions to help small and medium-sized enterprises. “The ratification and pending entry into force of the CPTPP is a strong affirmation of the parties’ commitment to free and open trade and a rules-based trading system,\" he said. To help companies understand the benefits of the CPTPP, MTI is working with its agencies, the Singapore Business Federation, as well as trade associations and chambers, to conduct outreach sessions. Economic agencies including Enterprise Singapore and the Economic Development Board will also help local firms with their plans to access or establish supply chains in the CPTPP markets, said Mr Chan. Singapore ratified the trade pact on Jul 19, becoming the third nation to do so after Mexico and Japan. The CPTPP will enter into force 60 days after six of the 11 signatories ratify the agreement.

He was responding to questions by several Members of Parliament on the rejection of 17-year-old Singaporean footballer Benjamin Davis' application to defer National Service enlistment.  Dr Ng pointed to Saifullah Akbar, Ikhsan and Irfan Fandi, three local footballers who have completed their NS and have been talent-spotted to take part in trials for clubs competing in professional leagues overseas. \"In fact, Saifullah Akbar and Ikhsan Fandi asked to be enlisted early, presumably so that they could complete their NS early to pursue their professional careers,\" Dr Ng said. According to Dr Ng, Saifullah played for the Under-16 national team and was spotted by an Australian club at age 16 but went ahead to enlist for NS. As for the Fandi brothers, he said Irfan and Ikhsan trained and played for the Under-22 national team during the 2017 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, supported by the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team. \"Irfan and Ikhsan are now playing for the Young Lions in the Singapore Premier League and representing Singapore in regional football competitions,\" Dr Ng said. \"I understand Irfan has gone for trials with European clubs, including an upcoming trial with Sporting Braga, and Saifullah and Ikhsan are slated to follow suit at CD Tenerife and Braga, respectively. \"This is a good sign for football in Singapore and talented footballers, Ben Davis included, can emulate the example of Irfan, Saifullah and Ikhsan to complete both their NS duties as required and also advance their professional football careers.\"  MINDEF remains open to considering deferment applications where athletes' achievements might not be quantitatively assessed due to the nature of sports they participate in, added Dr Ng, in response to a question from MP Darryl David, who cited the hypothetical example of a local sportsman who wins a junior tennis championship on the global stage. \"The answer is yes – if it satisfies the criteria that I’ve talked about - that we maintain equity for all other NSmen, and that they serve national interest, never their own,\" replied Dr Ng. \"If the first example you gave was that he competes in tennis then he decides that he wants to be a professional tennis player before he comes back – obviously that will affect our considerations.\" Dr Ng added that there has been no change in MINDEF's policy on NS deferment. \"It has not changed over the time that MINDEF has administered this policy,\" added Dr Ng, responding to a question from MP Pritam Singh. PROVISIONS DURING COMPETITIONS  For the recent SEA Games 2015 and 2017, Dr Ng said the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) had supported those competing by adjusting NS enlistment dates for those affected so that they could participate in the Games first, including some footballers. \"Those who were already enlisted were given time off to train and maintain their peak performance,\" he said. Dr Ng added that for the upcoming Asian Games later in August, MINDEF has given 10 national servicemen a \"short postponement of their enlistment of a few weeks, or if they have been enlisted, time off to train for the Games\". This includes a member of the water polo team that clinched their 27th straight SEA Games gold medal last year. \"Besides these provisions, MINDEF has offered disruption to full-time National Servicemen competing in these games,\" Dr Ng added. \"Very few have chosen to disrupt, perhaps because they are able to train adequately in the SAF.\" These examples show that \"MINDEF has exercised flexibility towards sportsmen competing in team sports\", Dr Ng concluded, \"without transgressing the fundamentals of NS and still maintaining equity for all national servicemen\". \"MINDEF will work with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Sport (MCCY) SG and other relevant agencies through various pathways that can allow sportsmen to do well and still fulfil their NS obligations, be it in individual or team sports.\" NO PRIORITY FOR INDIVIDUAL OVER TEAM SPORTS: MCCY Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu also noted that MCCY does not \"favour individual sports over team sports\" in their support for NS-liable athletes' deferment. \"My ministry shares Singaporeans’ aspirations for excellence in sports, and does not favour individual sports over team sports. Across all sports, we objectively assess the NSAs’ (National Sports Associations) development plans and targets,\" she said. \"For team sports, we have to adopt a whole-team development strategy which covers the entire squad of athletes, beyond just an individual athlete.\" These considerations include \"the robustness\" of the NSA’s development plans for the team, whether there is a clear target of a major games competition in sight and plans to hit that target, as well as the individual athlete’s role and potential contribution to the national team, Ms Fu explained. \"If there are sporting talents who are part of this squad, and who demonstrate commitment to represent Singapore and serve NS, MCCY is prepared to work with MINDEF to evaluate NS deferment applications, or training privileges during NS so that the enlisted athletes can train together with the rest of the squad,\" she added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ng-eng-hen-on-ns-deferment-team-sports-ben-davis-10592832"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 02:24PM", "tags": ["ComfortDelGro", "transport"], "author": "", "title": "ComfortDelGro launches on-demand bus booking app", "content": " SINGAPORE: ComfortDelGro on Monday (Aug 6) launched an on-demand booking app for commuters looking to book a ride on its bus services.  The app, called CDGBus OnDemand, guarantees a seat for commuters who successfully book a ride on a premium bus service.  The popular Tanjong Rhu to Shenton Way premium service, which costs S$5 per trip, is the only one available through the app for a start, but there are plans to roll out more services on the app in future. ComfortDelGro said in its media release that the service is similar to one that its sister company in Australia, CDC NSW, has already launched.  Commuters will be able to make multiple bookings up to 24 hours in advance and can do so for multiple passengers. They can also store regular pick-up and drop-off points as \"Favourites\" in their app for quicker bookings in the future.  Bookings will be confirmed once payments are made through debit or credit card. The app will also allow commuters to track the status of the bus prior to its arrival.  The Tanjong Rhu to Shenton Way service operates from Mondays to Fridays and offers eight trips during morning peak hours from 7.45am to 9.15am, as well as six trips during the evening peak hours between 6pm and 8pm.  Buses are scheduled to arrive at intervals of between 10 and 20 minutes, and passengers can board the bus from designated pick-up points along the service route.  If a bus is oversubscribed, priority will be given to commuters who had booked a ride via the app while the rest will have to wait for the next available bus.  Mr Pang Weng Heng, CEO of ComfortDelBro Bus said it \"makes sense\" for the company to launch the new service with the \"wide proliferation of smartphones\" for the convenience of its commuters. \"It gives them the assurance of a ride with the affordability of a bus ride. We plan to roll out more services on the app going forward,\" added Mr Pang. The app launch comes after a series of acquisitions in recent months made by ComfortDelGro. The company had announced in April that it will acquire the private bus chartering assets of AZ Bus for S$10.25 million in one of the largest deals in the local bus charter industry. More recently, it announced it will also acquire the private bus chartering assets of Ric-Tat Travel & Coach Services and its associated companies.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/comfortdelgro-launches-on-demand-bus-booking-app-10592738"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 01:49PM", "tags": ["Ben Davis", "football", "Ministry of Defence", "Ng Eng Hen"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "‘No indication’ how Ben Davis will help Singapore football if deferred from NS: Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: The reasons for the rejection of the application to defer Benjamin Davis' National Service were spelled out in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6), with Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen highlighting it has not been shown how such a move would benefit Singapore football.  “There has been no indication, commitment or plans as to how Mr Ben Davis would help football standards in Singapore if deferred,” Dr Ng said. Dr Ng was responding to questions from Members of Parliament, who had asked about the criteria that determine if an athlete can be deferred from NS. Davis, 17, had signed a two-year contract with newly promoted English Premier League (EPL) side Fulham, the club announced on Jul 13. His father, Mr Harvey Davis, said it would have allowed his son to pursue his dream of playing in the EPL and “make Singapore proud by being the first Singaporean to play in the EPL”, after news broke that his NS deferment application had been rejected. While the father had said that his son would serve as an inspiration for the students at his youth football academy JSSL Singapore, Dr Ng said JSSL is a business which advertises itself as having links with Fulham FC. \"Mr Harvey Davis has urged MINDEF to approve deferment for his son so that it would serve as an inspiration, he tells us, for the 1,000 students registered with his company JSSL – 500 or so who are local,\" said Dr Ng.  \"For your information, JSSL Singapore, or Junior Soccer School & League Singapore, is a youth football club and academy business run by Mr Harvey Davis and advertises itself as having links to Fulham FC.\" Dr Ng reiterated that athletes are deferred only if it serves Singapore’s interests, stating that Davis’ father has been “quite open” with what has been deemed as contrasting priorities. “The application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son’s deferment is to further his son’s professional career first and to the longest extent possible,” Dr Ng added. “Singapore and her interests, including his son’s NS obligations, are secondary considerations, if at all. “There is no commitment to serve Singapore or our national interests.” REASONS FOR REJECTION Dr Ng gave three reasons why Davis’ application was rejected. The first is that Davis is playing for Fulham as an English national, not a Singapore citizen, Dr Ng said, referring to information published on the club's website. It has been reported that in addition to his Singapore citizenship, Davis holds UK and Thai passports due to his parents’ lineage. “MINDEF (Ministry of Defence) is not privy to the contract signed between them, but we assume this published information is correct and that the father must have his reasons for doing so,” Dr Ng added. Second, Dr Ng said Davis’ father has \"consistently refused” to indicate when his son would return to serve NS, pointing to a reply he gave authorities stating that he was “unable to commit to a date” due to the possibility that his son would be offered a new contract or sent out on loan. “If Mr Ben Davis will not give up his senior contract, which provides for an allowance of a few hundred pounds a week, to serve his NS, it is even more unlikely that he will return to serve NS if he subsequently gets offered a contract worth many times more,” Dr Ng added. \"And if he is not given a further contract with Fulham FC, the father has said that he may find other clubs which his son can be loaned to.”  Third, Dr Ng said Mr Davis has indicated that his son would still proceed to sign the contract if not granted deferment, something which he has already done. \"The reason given by the father was that his son would only return to fulfil his NS commitment if he is unsuccessful in his professional career,\" Dr Ng added. \"In fact, Mr Harvey Davis went further after MINDEF rejected the application – that he would consider the option for his son to renounce his Singapore citizenship in order to pursue his career.\" Still, Davis would only be able to renounce his citizenship at the age of 21, after completing his NS. MINDEF had said in a 2011 news report that for male Singapore citizens, “the acquisition of foreign citizenship or any claim of dual citizenship does not exempt them from their NS obligations\". NS PRINCIPLES To that end, Dr Ng stressed that NS obligations are “crucial to our nation’s survival”, as he referred to a 2017 written judgement by the Appellate High Court during an appeal on the sentencing of NS defaulters. The judges said that every male Singaporean must serve NS at the time he is required to under the Enlistment Act, “without regard to his personal convenience and considerations”. “When a person refuses to serve NS at the time that he is required to and instead returns to serve at a time of his own choosing, or worse, at an age when he can no longer serve, his actions strike at the very core of the principles of national security, universality and equity,” they wrote. After a new sentencing framework was established last year, Dr Ng said 13 NS defaulters were prosecuted in court. “Some wanted to complete their university degree first before NS. Others said they had to support their families,” Dr Ng said, pointing out that the courts dismissed these personal reasons and convicted and sentenced them to jail terms. “The Enlistment Act is blind to 'personal convenience and considerations’, no matter how talented the individual or exceptional his circumstances.” Continuing on that theme, Dr Ng said deferment is granted to individuals very selectively, “if their deferment serves Singapore’s interest first and foremost, never their own”. Athletes who have deferred have clear expectations on the standards required for their training, Dr Ng said. This includes swimmers Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen, and sailor Maximilian Soh, all of whom were given this chance to train and compete in the Olympics. “Neither was deferment open-ended or unconditional,” he said. “They will have to return to serve NS, and if they do not meet the standards agreed upon, deferment will be curtailed.” As for disruption for individuals after they are enlisted for NS, including those granted to medical students, Dr Ng said this follows the same principles and is also given only for “national reasons”. “We disrupt medical students to complete their medical studies because we need them to serve as medical officers during their NS to take care of their fellow soldiers,” he explained. “It’s not an entitlement and once the reasons are no longer valid, the disruption will end.” Going back to the court’s written judgement, Dr Ng noted that everyone has to do his “fair share”, including “every citizen who is required to serve NS making sacrifices or postponing individual goals to serve the nation when the nation needs his service”. “These arguments spell out in unequivocal terms the NS obligations for every Singaporean male,” Dr Ng added. “Deferment therefore cannot be for that individual, no matter how talented, to pursue his own interests or career, even if it vicariously brings credit or fame to Singapore. “This would be fundamentally wrong and goes against the core principle of equity.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ben-davis-national-service-deferment-parliament-ng-eng-hen-10592728"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 12:24PM", "tags": ["Mediacorp", "ESPN", "advertising"], "author": "", "title": "Mediacorp, ESPN ink agreement, sports publisher becomes first to join Mediacorp Partner Network", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mediacorp and ESPN announced the launch of a strategic digital collaboration on Monday (Aug 6), with the digital sports publisher becoming the first company to join the Mediacorp Partner Network.

Sivakadacham has also been disqualified from acting in any capacity as a governing board member, trustee, or key officer in any charity in the future. In a press statement, the COC said the decision was made after careful consideration, following the findings of an inquiry into allegations of \"severe mismanagement\" in the administration of the temple in Little India. On Aug 22, 2017, the COC instituted an inquiry into the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. The inquiry revealed severe mismanagement in the administration of the temple, primarily during the period from Jan 1, 2011 to Jul 31, 2014, by certain management committee members. These members were the cheque signatories and approvers for payments, one of whom was Sivakadacham, who was the treasurer. He was subsequently appointed as the chairman of the charity on Nov 20, 2016. Given the severity of the inquiry findings, on Apr 30, 2018 and with the consent of the Attorney-General, the COC suspended Sivakadacham from the exercise of his office as governing board member and trustee of the charity with immediate effect. The COC also gave notice of its intention to remove Sivakadacham from the exercise of his office as a governing board member and trustee of the charity, and invited representations on the COC’s proposal. The decision on a removal order against Sivakadacham came after careful consideration of the inquiry’s findings and all representations received. The COC added that it was satisfied that there was mismanagement in the administration of the charity for which Sivakadacham was responsible for or privy to, or have by his conduct contributed to or facilitated. The COC then deemed it necessary to act for the purpose of protecting the property of the charity. The COC, Dr Ang Hak Seng, said: “Any negative conduct within the charity sector can bring about serious damage and erode public trust in our charities. Hence, we cannot tolerate mismanagement or misconduct in the administration of charities. “Governing board members and key office holders should always act in the best interest of the charities, and be accountable to the public.

The changes include strengthening director independence by reducing their shareholding threshold from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, and limiting the tenure for independent directors to nine years through a two-tier shareholders' vote. To enhance board diversity, at least one-third of the board should be made up of independent directors – unless the chairman is not independent, in which case the majority should comprise of independent directors. Otherwise, the majority of the board should comprise of non-executive directors.  Companies must also disclose their board diversity policy and the progress made, MAS said. The amendments to SGX's listing rules will take effect on Jan 1 next year, except for the rules on the nine-year tenure for independent directors and the requirement for independent directors to comprise one-third of the board.

To enhance board diversity, at least one-third of the board should be made up of independent directors – unless the chairman is not independent, in which case the majority should comprise of independent directors. Otherwise, the majority of the board should comprise of non-executive directors.  Companies must also disclose their board diversity policy and the progress made, MAS said. The amendments to SGX's listing rules will take effect on Jan 1 next year, except for the rules on the nine-year tenure for independent directors and the requirement for independent directors to comprise one-third of the board. These two rules will take effect on Jan 1, 2022. \"The longer transition period accords companies sufficient time to ensure the composition of their boards is able to meet the requirements of the listing rules,\" SGX said. The Code of Corporate Governance is applicable to listed companies in Singapore on a comply-or-explain basis. It requires companies to adhere to the principles of the code and provide explanations for variations from its provisions or guidelines in their annual reports.  Mr Ong Chong Tee, MAS deputy managing director for financial supervision, said: “The revised code is more concise and less prescriptive, and is designed to encourage more thoughtful application. It will help spur better corporate governance practices among companies to sustain long-term business performance.\"  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE  In line with the council’s recommendations, MAS said it will also establish an independent Corporate Governance Advisory Committee to advocate good corporate governance practices.  The committee will monitor companies’ implementation of the code, and provide support to companies by promulgating good practices and areas for improvement. It will also advise regulators on corporate governance issues.  The committee will comprise senior practitioners with experience as board chairmen or directors, corporate governance experts and representatives from diverse stakeholder groups. MAS expects to establish the committee by the end of this year. The Code of Corporate Governance was first issued by the Corporate Governance Committee on May 2, 2002. The code was subsequently revised on Jul 14, 2005, and again on May 2, 2018.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sgx-listing-rules-corporate-governance-code-mas-10592054"}, {"datetime": "06 Aug 2018 08:12AM", "tags": ["Lombok", "earthquake"], "author": "", "title": "Lombok quake: Shanmugam and Singapore delegation waiting for flight out of island", "content": " SINGAPORE: Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said on Monday (Aug 6) that he and the Singapore delegation were waiting for a flight out of Lombok, after the Indonesian island was hit by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake.  The powerful quake has killed at least 91 people and wounded hundreds, with thousands of buildings also left damaged.  On Sunday, Mr Shanmugam in a Facebook post said he was in his hotel room when he felt the effects of the quake which shook the building and cracked the walls.  The Minister, who is attending a security conference in Mataram, Lombok, described the situation in an update on Monday.  \"After waiting by the roadside, we went to another hotel, low rise, 3 storeys.

OCBC, Singapore's second-largest listed lender, said on Monday (Aug 6) its net profit for the three months ended Jun 30 came in at S$1.21 billion, versus S$1.04 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting a lower net profit of S$1.11 billion for the quarter. OCBC's results came after biggest-listed DBS Group missed market estimates, while the smallest lender, United Overseas Bank, beat estimates.  Analysts say an easing of Singapore's economic growth amid an international trade row, as well as new property curbs imposed last month, have clouded the outlook for banks after they reported record profits last year. \"The operating environment is increasingly challenging and we are watchful of the severe implications to the global economy and financial markets from the escalating trade and political tensions,\" OCBC CEO Samuel Tsien said in a statement. OCBC's net interest margin - a key gauge of a bank’s profitability - came in at 1.67 per cent in the second quarter, 2 basis points higher than 1.65 per cent a year earlier. The higher margin helped to push net interest income to S$1.45 billion, an 8 per cent increase from a year ago. Mr Tsien said the strong net interest income was driven by robust loan growth and improved asset yields in Singapore and Malaysia. The bank has declared an interim dividend of S$0.20 per share for the first half of 2018, up from S$0.18 a year ago.  With its second-quarter numbers, OCBC posted net earnings of S$2.32 billion for the first half of the year, up 22 per cent from a year ago. In view of the recently announced property cooling measures, OCBC’s management said it is confident of maintaining a high single digit growth in its overall loans portfolio in the quarters ahead – citing that its pipeline of loans and housing loans outstanding is enough to carry the bank forward. It does not expect an especially significant impact in the near term, but the impact could become more severe “one or two years down the road”. But for now, OCBC does not expect a complete collapse of the mortgage market, citing that there is also still significant interest from first time home buyers and that homeowners whose property have gone en bloc  and will still have to come back into the property market to buy new homes. The lender confirmed that it will not see the “same sort of exuberance” in the property market seen in the first half of this year.

Some claim that the process of ragging can produce cohesiveness and membership loyalty, and may end with the inclusion and initiation of the victim into the group. Most feel a sense of liking and loyalty thereafter, and so are likely to accept practices. Ragging experiences are “justified” since members see it as a rite of passage for newcomers. And with the mindset of “I had to do it, so you have to as well” instilled in group members, many support and perpetuate the practice of such rituals despite bans and stringent controls. Participants may not see ragging as causing harm, especially if participants in a rite of passage had survived it and came out closer than ever. These practices are, however, dangerous. Students who have difficulties transitioning into university can end up feeling victimised or even depressed from ragging rituals as part of orientation activities they have little choice but to take part in. Ragging can also be violent, and in rare cases, might even lead to death. In 2013, a student of a fraternity in the City University of New York died from head injuries as a result of extreme ragging rituals. He had to carry a weighed-down backpack through a gauntlet of fraternity members across a yard of ice, blindfolded, and was tackled repeatedly, according to news reports. Last week, five Singapore Civil Defence Force officers were charged over the death of Corporal Kok Yuen Chin, who had drowned during a ragging incident. Corporal Kok’s death has incited discussions about ragging practices and bullying in the workplace, and how future incidences can be prevented. INTENTIONAL OR HARMLESS PRANK? While they do share certain key characteristics, ragging and bullying are not the same. Ragging aims to induce liking of the group and results in inclusivity and cohesiveness. Harm is never a goal, but a sometimes unseen by-product. Bullies, on the other hand, carry out their actions with the intention to harm and isolate the victim from the group. Ragging rituals are often only carried out once on a single victim, while bullying is an ongoing process of harassing. In most cases, perpetrators of ragging function in an organised team with a practical goal, while workplace bullies work alone or as a clique that has no functional value in terms of workplace contributions. Workplace bullying and harassment cover a wider scope that includes passive-aggressiveness and threats that include the withholding of promotions, even though both ragging and bullying include verbal and physical abuse and seemingly harmless pranks that can turn ugly. Contrary to popular beliefs, workplace bullies do not target their victims out of low self-esteem, nor are their targets necessarily loners of the team. Most bullies often act out due to their inability to manage and react to stress or problems adequately and handle their experiences in a positive manner. Only a minority possess antisocial tendencies that result in destructive behaviours toward others and the company. Victims are usually performers or popular members of the team – the perfect target for bullies to channel their stress. Workplace bullying behaviours are generally difficult to spot, but their effects are extremely visible. If a performer shows a sudden drop in performance or change in attitude, that might be a sign they are being bullied. Abrupt changes in team behaviours and dynamics must also be watched closely. These are alarming especially when someone new joins the team. HARMFUL ACTIONS NOT TOLERABLE While public attention has been focused on stamping out ragging, it is just as important to focus our efforts on identifying and addressing workplace bullying. While certain bullies cannot be deterred in the same way that ragging can, most of them can be changed. The first step is to go beyond stating that bullying will not be tolerated. Laying out the details of what will not be accepted helps to guide a better understanding of the behaviours that constitute bullying, as certain bullies are unaware that their actions are considered bullying. Second, never ignore claims and complaints, but investigate them with a clear and transparent process that all employees have been informed of. Last, members of an organisation can help create a bully-free environment by stepping in or reporting whenever an incident occurs. While ragging should never be condoned, it shouldn’t mean that we shy away from initiation practices altogether. When done right under adequate management, initiation rituals have been shown to increase team unity and performance. They are still beneficial in militaristic or sports settings given the nature of these groups. Initiation rituals should always be carried out with an atmosphere of mutual respect, or include certain bonding elements. Having meals together, or outdoor team-building activities, are some examples that do not infringe on the dignity of participants. Likewise, these practices can also be used to increase workplace bonding and cooperation, which can reduce the likelihood of workplace bullying. The key takeaway is that any kind of practice that results in harm, both physical and psychological, should be explicitly prohibited.

Mr Shanmugam, who is attending a security conference in Mataram, Lombok, said he and the Singapore delegation are safe. \"I was in my room, 10th floor, working on my laptop. Suddenly the room shook violently, walls cracked, it was quite impossible to stand up.

The US Geological Survey said initially the magnitude of the quake was 7.0, but later revised it to 6.9.  The quake occurred at a depth of 15 km, the Indonesian Meteorological Agency said. It also prompted a tsunami warning, but this was later lifted. Residents in Lombok's main city Mataram described a strong jolt that sent people scrambling out of buildings. \"Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking,\" Iman, a local resident in Mataram, told AFP. Mr Shanmugam urged Singaporeans affected by the earthquake to contact the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta. \"Hoping that there are no serious injuries and that everyone will be ok,\" he said.

In one corner of the grounds, one group in pink were laughing, waving to the Boy Scouts at the campsite next door, and chatting about their most recent camping trip to Switzerland. \"We kept getting scolded,\" Yvette Cheak said, gesturing at Anna Tham next to her. \"We had such a good time.\" \"We were the clowns,\" Petrina Giam chimed in. \"We brought the house down.\" Their laughter echoed through the grounds. Their conversation, filled with a yearning for adventure – their next camping trip is to Melbourne – sounded typical of young women. But, in fact, these lively ladies were approaching their 70s and into their 80s. They have known each other for more than 50 years, and their friendship has remained the same, even now as proud grandmothers. They are former Girl Guides who belong to the Trefoil Guild, the adult branch (25 and above) of the Guiding movement. And their bonds remain strong because of what they have cultivated since they first met: Teamwork. \"It’s teamwork in action. It's not just talking about it,” said Mrs Cheak, 68. “This is really where you see how the girls team up together and then go for it.\" Around them, the schoolgirls are part of an evolving organisation. And this sisterhood of old friends have also moved with the times. More importantly, they are passing on a rich legacy, not least of friendship. O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN! Mrs Cheak and Mrs Giam, 69, were 16 and 17 years old respectively when they became Ranger Guides after completing their O Levels and leaving their respective Guiding companies in the Singapore Chinese Girls’ School. That was when they met Mrs Tham, their captain. \"She was a very fierce captain,\" Mrs Giam recalled, looking at her with a playful smile. Added Mrs Cheak: \"We were always full of respect. There's no question about it. But at the same time, we were scared because she had this aura – very stern, very disciplined and very clever.” Mrs Tham also has an air of wisdom that now comes from her 84 years of age. Sitting composedly and wearing blue eye shadow, the captain’s demeanour soon gave way, however, to her mischievous streak. \"I liked to bring them to cemeteries,\" she said with a hearty laugh. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It was enough to set Mrs Giam off on an animated retelling of those moments: \"As you can imagine, we stumbled over tombstones, and we were like, ‘Sorry, sorry, sorry.’” After pitching many tents and starting many campfires together, the bonds they formed melted the ice queen. “And then they bullied me,\" Mrs Tham said with a chuckle. At times, their Girl Guide adventures were much more harrowing than cemetery capers. Recalling one such experience in the late 1960s, when Singapore had many more farms, Mrs Tham said: Somebody went trekking around the farms, and the farmers came out with a gun. Their farm explorations were otherwise less dangerous, however, and those memories are a reminder to them of how Guiding has changed, with a smaller range of outdoor opportunities nowadays. On the other hand, Guiding is now offered as a co-curricular activity (CCA) in more schools – more than 55 per cent of primary and secondary schools – than it was back then. Mrs Tham remembered that she had joined an open company at the headquarters, meant for girls from different schools. That was in 1949. \"It was a choice we made, not that we were put into the CCA,\" she said. “And because it was a choice we made, we really put ourselves into the movement.\" Until today, her fellow Guides are proud of how well she has done throughout the years. \"She ran Singapore’s first Land Rangers company,\" said Mrs Cheak. \"Today, she's (still) our captain – she's known to us as captain.\" GUIDES AT WORK AND AT HOME Although they had joined the Guiding movement for a taste of adventure, it gave them much more eventually, including in their careers. As they became mothers and grandmothers too, the values from their early Guiding days never left them either. \"It helped a lot during my time as principal,\" said Mrs Tham, an ex-principal of Methodist Girls' School, as she recalled the day when a pupil had sustained a deep cut on her leg after falling on a glass panel. It was bleeding very badly. And everyone was so panicky. I said, ‘Lie down, calm down.’ I stopped the bleeding, called for the ambulance and then went back (to the office). Mrs Cheak, a former regional head of compliance at a French bank who still acts as an adviser to the Association of Banks in Singapore, agreed that Guiding was good preparation for her career. “Because of my role (in compliance), I have to be very careful, very calm,\" she said. And nothing gave her more confidence that she could manage in her job than her Guiding experience. Juggling everyday life with their roles as Guides, however, was not easy. Mrs Wah Teng Siew, 82, the chief commissioner of Girl Guides Singapore from 1984 to 1989, recalled her hectic schedule then, having had to travel multiple times for regional conferences. While she was in office, Singapore also worked to bring in the organisation’s world conference. \"I think I ran out of leave,” the former radiographer said wryly – a sentiment shared by the other three Guides, who are also good friends with her. They were so involved in the Guiding community that their families would miss their presence at home. \"My son would complain, ‘Mummy, when you're not home, we only eat canned food,’\" Mrs Cheak said with a chuckle. Perhaps inevitably, however, their families have also carried on a strong tradition from them. \"My second daughter is a President’s Guide (award winner),” beamed Mrs Tham, whose other daughter was also a Guide while her son was a Scout. \"And both granddaughters got the chief commissioner's award.\" There was no disguising the women’s sense of pride as they talked about their children and grandchildren who followed in their footsteps. “We left it to them. But then they’d see pictures (of us), and ask, ‘Who’s this? What’s this uniform?’ And this was when I’d tell them a little bit. Then they made their decisions,” said Mrs Cheak. All three of her sons became Scouts, and two of them were awarded the President's Scout Award. WATCH: Over 50 years of friendship and Girl Guiding (5:05)  SPENDING TIME WITH THE BOYS Another topic of lively chatter among these ladies – but prompting more gales of laughter and playfully raised eyebrows – was boys, or rather, Boy Scouts. “We were always with the Scouts who taught us how to make gadgets,” said Mrs Cheak, who then gestured at Mrs Giam. “That's how she met her boyfriend.” “Boyfriends,” Mrs Giam interjected. Banter aside, the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, in Singapore and elsewhere, have a long shared history. It started in London in 1909, at the first Boy Scout Rally, which a handful of determined girls gatecrashed to request Robert Baden-Powell – the founder of the Scouts – to have “something for the girls”. And even now, these four friends collaborate with the senior Scouts. “When the Scouts have training, they’d invite our Guides to go, like for campfire training,” said Mrs Cheak. “Then the Guides who are free and our trainers who can manage will join them.” One of the most recent get-togethers was on July 14, when the senior Scouts organised a walk in Kampung Lorong Buangkok, Singapore’s last kampung. It was pouring, but that did not dampen the seniors’ spirits as they sang that famous nursery rhyme for the rain to go away. These joint activities span the gamut from camping to purely social meet-ups, said 49-year-old Malcolm Tan, a “lawyer by profession, scout by choice”. “We arrange to have Chinese New Year gatherings, Christmas gatherings and … from time to time, we have hikes and all that,” said the Scout Guild assistant secretary. The Singapore Scout Guild was established in 1996, while the Trefoil Guild here was founded in 1973 and has more than 100 members, with the oldest active member now 89 years old. DEVELOPING GIRLS IN DIFFERENT WAYS One of the lasting legacies that Trefoil Guild members have left to newer generations of Guides has been Camp Christine, located at Jalan Bahtera and opened in 1988 after “fierce fundraising”, noted Mrs Wah. With the changing times, however, there are also Guiding initiatives being rolled out that she and her friends would never have had. Take, for example, the Surf Smart Badge, which equips girls to be vigilant and responsible online citizens who can protect themselves and their rights on the Internet. The four ladies agree that \"everything is Google\" now, but see hands-on training as crucial too. And they may no longer be as active in the Guiding movement as they once were, but this is where they continue to support its activities and help to develop girls in different ways. They volunteer to be testers, for example, in the President’s Guide Award Camp. \"We’re like resources they can call on to help because we’re all retired or semi-retired,\" said Mrs Cheak. The thing we can do as alumni is try to close that gap in experience – the character building, the values, the community, the communication, the leadership. To some of the young Guides, however, because the camp was something for which they had been preparing “for a very long time\", they expected it to be “nerve-wracking” – until they got to know their testers. \"I was quite scared of them at first because they were testing us, but they’re actually very nice, like the one who tested me (Mrs Tham),” said 15-year-old Alexa Yeo. “She gave me a lot of interesting advice and on things I hadn't come across in school. She taught me a completely different and new kind of lashing.\" The Raffles Girls' School student may well be starting a journey like the one her testers embarked on all those years ago. “When I came to secondary school, I didn't expect to join the Guides either, but over the years, it has become a family to me,” she said. The primary goals and values the Guiding movement inculcates remain the same, and ultimately, it is supposed to be fun – and a close sisterhood. “Guiding is supposed to be a game …” said Mrs Tham, “… And we're still playing the game,” continued Mrs Wah, completing the sentence. “The passion never dies …” added Mrs Cheak, “… And we want to give back,” went Mrs Giam, without hesitation. Once a Guide, always a Guide – it is a core value these four are familiar with, and they are holding to it together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/sisterhood-friends-guiding-legacy-trefoil-girl-guides-singapore-10590188"}, {"datetime": "05 Aug 2018 06:01AM", "tags": ["e-commerce", "Lazada", "Alibaba", "online shopping"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Alibaba-owned Lazada looks to 'crush' competition, goes on charm offensive to win over online sellers", "content": " SINGAPORE: Ms Michelle Lee, the co-founder of online-only retailer Trippy Travelers, stumbled into the world of e-commerce by accident. A sense of wanderlust and desire to share the spoils of their trips with others led Ms Lee and her boyfriend to start a modest online business selling travel essentials, customisable world maps and other knick knacks.  The 27-year-old architectural designer left her job to co-found Trippy Travelers and started selling on e-commerce platform Lazada in early 2016, despite having next to no knowledge of doing business, and online at that. From selling a handful of products, her online business grew. She now offers more than 100 products, including her own brand of Travel Bandits journals. And Ms Lee attributed the success to tools Lazada recently added for sellers to better reach customers and make sales.  She pointed to a feature called Seller Picks introduced just “two to three weeks ago”. This allows online retailers like her, to pick up to three of their products to be more easily discovered by people - or “boosted”, as she described it. “This feature helped increased sales by five to eight times the usual traffic, the entrepreneur told Channel NewsAsia in a recent interview, although she did not provide the baseline figure for comparison. She also has a positive view on the Business Advisor dashboard introduced in January this year. Ms Lee said: “With Business Advisor, you’re able to see which product is selling, which isn’t, and which are the ones that may not be competitively priced. It also shows which product was added to a consumer’s checkout cart, but not purchased in the end, and gives us the opportunity to either cut prices or give discount coupons - and these are then conveyed to customers through push app notifications. “This helps us to make better business decisions ... and tweak according to customers’ needs,” she added. Another online retailer, Mr Soon Qishan who runs video game shop Qisahn.com, also lauded the tools that Lazada has been introducing to help businesses like his be more visible. Competition is fierce in the market space he operates in - selling video game consoles and other services - as he is a reseller, and there are many others like him in the market. For him, it’s about finding a competitive edge, however small, to entice customers to buy from him rather than rival offerings. So, the ability to “decorate” his online presence on Lazada and flag to people that he is based in Singapore and has a brick-and-mortar shop here in case they need to physically inspect their purchase is an advantage Mr Soon readily mentioned.  “I do this to try and be a bit better (than overseas sellers),” Mr Soon told Channel NewsAsia, adding he is “happy to know” there are customers out there who still have a buy-from-Singapore mentality. The 32-year-old’s business has also benefited from joint campaigns with Lazada. He cited a recent campaign that resulted in “a huge spike in sales for three days” and raked in S$178,000 during that period, which he said was 25 times more than normal days. That said, Mr Soon acknowledged that not all campaigns are as successful. He also said not all the tools Lazada is touting is new, like letting buyers and sellers chat using instant messaging, which has been available for a long time on his website. ONLINE RETAIL MATCHMAKER These tools for sellers were introduced after the e-commerce platform spent the past year understanding their needs and pain points, explained Mr Alexis Lanternier, CEO of Lazada Singapore. During a media lunch on Wednesday (Aug 1), Mr Lanternier shared that the goal for the company is to become “more and more like a matchmaker” to bring the right merchant to meet the consumer’s needs. Beyond the tools already mentioned, the executive pointed to its Treasure Bowl system that allows retailers to flag up to three products at a reduced price to Lazada to sell under its Flash Sales category, which is designed to be highly visible and accessible on its mobile app or Web portal. These products are made available at the reduced price for six hours, after which a new selection of products will be hawked online, he explained. “Through these sales, our algorithm learns to better match buyers with appropriate products,” Mr Lanternier explained, adding that it would give more exposure to retailers as shoppers tend to go on and browse the “shop” providing the item they were interested in initially. “WE ARE GOING TO CRUSH” THE COMPETITION It also announced on Wednesday it will remove the commission charge for Singapore sellers. It had previously charged sellers between 1 per cent and 7 per cent per sale, depending on the category of products. “Completely doing away with commission charges will help lower the cost of doing business on the platform and create new opportunities for local merchants to venture into the e-commerce space,” the company said in its press release. In contrast, competitors like Sea’s Shopee, for instance, has imposed a transaction fee of 1 per cent for sellers based in Singapore from Aug 1. Shopee, whose parent company is backed by Tencent, said then that the move highlights the shift in focus from merely growing the platform to building a more sustainable e-commerce ecosystem for users in the long run.  Singapore-based Giosis, which operates rival platform Qoo10, has also girded itself for competition after bolstering its war chest from the sale of its Japanese assets to eBay for an undisclosed amount, with reports pegging the deal at between US$573 million and US$700 million. The more cynical would view Lazada’s moves as a grab for market share and, once a clear market leadership has been established, additional fees and fewer promotions may be introduced to sellers and consumers. It’s a phenomenon that some argue is currently being seen in the local ride-hailing scene after Grab’s merger with rival Uber. Mr Lanternier acknowledged the point but said its acquisition by Chinese Internet behemoth Alibaba meant that such fears can and should be allayed. Alibaba announced in March this year it will invest an additional US$2 billion in Lazada, bringing the total investment to US$4 billion, and installed chairwoman Lucy Peng as its CEO too. He said sellers on Taobao, for instance, have not had to pay sales commission for years now and, given the scale of Alibaba’s e-commerce business, they can afford not to charge commission. “We aren’t too concerned about what the competition is doing, because we are going to crush them,” Mr Lanternier said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/alibaba-owned-lazada-looks-to-crush-competition-goes-on-charm-10585722"}, {"datetime": "05 Aug 2018 06:00AM", "tags": ["National Day Parade", "NDP", "National Day"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Sprints, heavy balloons and a lot of sweat: Preparing to be an NDP garland performer", "content": " SINGAPORE: A collective gasp rose from the audience as the 36 performers ran out on stage, the long strands of balloons they held swaying gracefully in the air. Instrumental music played as they ran around the stage using the giant balloons to create beautiful shapes and formations, the bright lights affixed to 12 garlands – each 18m in height – twinkling in the evening sky. As two of the three performers carrying the garland slowly released it in unison, audience members – made up mostly of Primary 5 students – screamed in excitement.  The students in attendance were enjoying a preview of this year’s National Day Parade (NDP), and the giant balloon garlands featured in the second act of the show segment were an obvious hit with them. But far less obvious was the sheer amount of hard work, strength and stamina required to create and execute this visual spectacle. WORSE THAN A 2.4KM RUN Garland performer Ronnie Lai is a self-professed natural on stage. The 22-year-old, who is waiting to enter university, has been in the drama club since he was a child, and studied theatre when he was in junior college. Performing on stage and hearing the audience cheer, he says, always gives him an adrenaline rush. But this time round, it’s better.   “Doing it for my country’s birthday is extra meaningful,” he said. “And when the audience saw the balloons and got so excited, it felt really nice, like my hard work, sweat and tears was all worth it.” Indeed, being a balloon garland performer is a strenuous task. With a 10m wire attached, each garland stretches out for close to 30 metres. The balloons themselves are the size of car tyres. If this does not already make the garlands difficult to manoeuvre, the performers also have to contend with the weight of a 4kg battery pack and the drag from the helium-filled balloons when they run. It is like pulling a 20kg weight, the organisers said. Even when they are standing still they have to resist the upward pull of the balloons. To make things even more exhausting, jogging slowly from position to position will not cut it. Performers, it turns out, have to sprint – while bearing the weight of the garlands.   “They look deceptively light, but they’re quite a beast to manoeuvre and manage on stage,” said Joshua Chia, a company commander from the 3rd Singapore Division and the person in charge of the balloon garland performers. “It’s like non-stop running,” added Ronnie. “We always say it’s worse than a 2.4km run.” GETTING IN SHAPE ... AND OUT OF EACH OTHER’S WAY  Getting in shape was, therefore, a key part of the training the team of performers had to go through. Since April they have been training together about two to three times a week, running around a parade square and making sure they could meet the timing required of them. “A basic level of physical fitness is definitely a key factor, in order to achieve the graceful, effortless look,” explained Joshua. “Throughout the act, there’s a lot of precision needed in achieving symmetry across the stage, as well as timeliness in arriving in positions.” “There is just so much to coordinate,” he added. “Just trying to do a simple forward run that involves six people having to run in a synchronised manner ... even without the balloons, it was tough.” “The pace and spacing has to be precise, aesthetically pleasing and correct so we don’t collide with one another and the garlands don’t get tangled up.” This, said Ronnie, turned out to be the main challenge. “We had to run together, in step and in cadence,” he said. “Even things like perfecting a circle is very important, so we don’t look lopsided and we’re evenly spaced out on stage.” As Ronnie easily strapped on the battery pack and deftly looped the long garland wire around his arm, it is clear that he knows what he is doing. But he admitted that it was not always like this. “When we first saw the balloons, we got a shock at first,” he recalled, grinning. “It was like, wow, they’re huge!” It was tiring at first, he added. But after multiple rounds of practice, the balloons became easier to handle. Little tricks and techniques he picked up along the way also came in useful. “You could say we learnt from our mistakes,” he said, as he held on to the balloons and ran around the stage without having to catch his breath. “For example, things like tightening the strap of the battery packs so it fits snugly on us, or knowing which hand to use to hold the wire ... there are so many little things to take note of.” Working together with his friends, he added, was also of vital importance. “It’s one thing for you to remember your own steps, and remember where you’re supposed to go, but we also need to know where everyone else’s markings are,” he said. “So a lot of teamwork is required.” But with the cheers of thousands of audience members ringing in their ears, it is clear that the team’s hard work has paid off – even if the real show has yet to come. “Watching them on stage with the beautiful garlands made me shed a tear,” admitted Joshua. “They were performing for their friends, family and parents.” “And I’m proud to say that they gave them a spectacle that they would definitely be proud of.” NATIONAL DAY PARADE 2018 | Watch the parade live on channelnewsasia.com starting from 5.30pm on Aug 9.Our livestream is also available on twitter.com/channelnewsasia and facebook.com/channelnewsasia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-balloons-performer-national-day-parade-2018-singapore-10578016"}, {"datetime": "05 Aug 2018 06:00AM", "tags": ["Singapore", "society", "values"], "author": "Gillian Koh", "title": "Commentary: Steps to a society of compassion and solidarity we can be proud of", "content": " SINGAPORE: \"人在江湖，身不由己\". This is a commonly used mandarin expression which states that as one steps out into the world, one cannot expect to live as one wishes to.  Some may choose, heroically, to pay the price of living by their lofty ideals, but this statement justifies the need to set those ideals aside. What happens if one’s personal values and beliefs or ideal vision of society differ vastly from what is playing out in society? How can one live with that? How can the gaps be narrowed? The findings from a survey series called the National Values Assessment conducted by a Singapore business consulting firm, aAdvantage and a British group, the Barrett Values Centre, provide a quick indicator of first, the gap between Singaporeans’ avowed personal values and their perception of society today, and second, the gap between that perception and their ideal model of it.  The findings are based on the views of 2,000 Singaporeans drawn using quota samples collected in 2012, 2015, and March to May 2018. POSITIVE PERSONAL VALUES First, the good news. The surveys indicate that, in defining themselves, Singaporeans consistently place great value on being caring, compassionate, family-oriented, responsible and fair. In defining their model society, Singaporeans say they espouse ideals of respect, and care for the elderly, the disadvantaged, the future generation and the environment across all three surveys. Affordable housing, effective healthcare and this year’s additions of educational opportunities and dependable public services, were among the other top ten descriptors of what respondents also want in their ideal society. Why is this good news? These suggest that issues of social inclusion and support are important to us. Such concerns were present across the board. Concern for seniors was among the top three values chosen across all age segments including the youngest, aged 15 to 30. Affordable housing was also among the top three values cited by respondents of all housing backgrounds, including those living in private apartments and landed property. GAP BETWEEN PERSONAL IDEALS AND REALITY Now, to the bad news – whether there is coherence between personal ideals, Singaporeans’ notions of their model society, and the reality they find themselves in, and why. The main values, attitudes and behaviours respondents said define their reality over the three surveys were selfish competitiveness (kiasu), the fear of failure (kiasi), self-centredness, materialism and a blaming culture. None of the top ten values on this list coincided with those that described personal values over the years.   But who makes up society? Clearly, many of us are compromising on our ideal set of values when we step out of our homes every morning. GAP BETWEEN IDEAL SOCIETY AND REALITY There was at least some resemblance between the top ten values and needs cited to describe current society with that of the ideal society - care for the elderly, effective healthcare and educational opportunities.  But the survey indicates that many of these needs are under-served today. How do we know? The survey compares the number of mentions made to the values respondents chose in describing current society and ideal society. The largest difference in the 2015 and 2018 surveys were in the areas of affordable housing, care for the elderly, the disadvantaged and the environment, as well as in the manifestation of virtues like compassion, respect and integrity. What are the choices we must make and the cost we must bear to transform society into one that mirrors our declared personal values and ideals more closely? Let us explore how we can grapple with that in a few of those areas. CHOICES AND COST TO CLOSING THE GAPS First, on affordable housing, in recent years, the Government has introduced cooling measures to tame the demand for property and raise the supply of new public housing units.  The rationale is to ensure prices do not outstrip the economic performance of the country and that buyers are not over-leveraged in their property loans in an uncertain financial market. These measures keep housing affordable. This is done at a cost to sellers of property. Within the “buy low, sell high” dictum where everyone wants to win in the property lottery of land-scarce Singapore, politically, this policy stance is controversial among segments of citizens and certain interest groups. Hence, the conundrum of governance – the calculus of what is good at the personal level can be different at the societal one. What is fair and inclusive policy for one group seems draconian and stifling for another. Second, on care for the elderly, we want senior family members to enjoy dignified and supported golden years. However, for most, it is simply too costly to achieve this on an individual household basis.  On the other hand, we can all manage it better when we pool our resources as individuals, communities and employers by paying taxes, by becoming contributors to national social risk-pooling schemes like Medishield Life and the proposed CareShield Life, or by building and running shared, community facilities in the heart of our neighbourhoods. Again, individual, private solutions will lead to different outcomes from collective ones.  Deciding who will carry which burden, who should benefit more are the choices we have to make for a welfare outcome that is superior all round. Reframing issues like these – from transactions to acts of solidarity will help us achieve that. Third, on nurturing compassion, care and respect, it is difficult to find an antidote to the corrosive selfish competitiveness that arise from widespread systems that appraise workplace performance or academic achievements on a bell curve. Active citizens wait for highly-regulated public agencies to provide permission and funding for local community projects at the cost of a diminished sense of ownership, authenticity and innovation. The balance between accountability and empowerment between state and people has to be part of the difficult conversation about developing the livelier civic space we want.   We need to nourish the collective and community far more if we are to live up to our nobler ideals that the survey series suggests are in us. Narratives like “no one owes you a living”, “don’t be weak or someone will take advantage of you”, “the small guy always gets swallowed up”, and “the good guy never wins” need similarly powerful counterpoints to allow notions of the common good to flourish.

Indeed, it has become synonymous with plastic surgery, not just in Singapore, but around the world. After all, the prominent Singaporean plastic surgeon invented a procedure named the Woffles Lift that is being used by surgeons everywhere. It’s a non-surgical procedure for face lifts which involves injecting self-retaining threads into the face and out through the scalp, eliminating the need for stitches and cutting recovery time from several weeks to just several days. But Dr Wu is more than a plastic surgeon as he has proven over the years.  For instance, the flamboyant doctor who often used to be seen wearing garish multi-hued shirts, also co-produced a film- Singapore Dreaming - in 2006. “It’s just to have a full life and to experience different things,” he says. The 58-year old arrives for our interview in a nondescript white short-sleeved shirt, clearly mellower than the last time I met him. It’s “a function of age”, he says. Throughout our conversation about his recently released memoir, Life in Plastic, and other issues, it’s clear that he has spent time processing pivotal events in his life including some painful ones.  From the challenges of his growing-up years, his relationship with his parents and his career challenges to the traffic offence that propelled him into the public eye for all the wrong reasons in 2010 - he speaks of these now with a calmness that reflects a comfortable acceptance. To listen to the full interview, click here.  THE TRAFFIC OFFENCE SAGA – “I ACCEPT IT WAS WRONG” While his memoir covers many of these events, one that is missing is the saga of how he got an elderly employee to take the rap for two speeding offences in 2005 and 2006. The case only came to light in 2010. He was fined S$1,000 for it and in 2014, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) suspended him from practice for four months, saying that with his “wrongful act”, he had “tarnished the good name of his profession”. The case sparked public discussions over whether he was let off too easily and it was even raised in Parliament in the context of the equitability of the legal system. I first ask Dr Wu why he left the incident, which he describes as harrowing, out of his memoir. “The whole saga and why it’s not in the book, is because it’s just too long and convoluted. It would have consumed the book,” he says. However, since I’ve asked, he agrees to discuss it with me and reveals information that he says was left out of news reports at the time. “First of all, the elderly employee was my godfather. He was very close to my family and he was helping out in the clinic. He was my employee in that respect because I gave him a salary. But it’s not as if I abused my position and went to this elderly guy and said 'Hey, you got to take the rap for me'. It wasn’t anything like that at all.” However, regardless of their relationship, why did he decide to get someone else to take responsibility for the speeding offences? “I’ll make one disclaimer first. I accept that it was wrong and I shouldn’t have done it but in those days, a lot of people were doing it. It was just a traffic fine and putting a name on the traffic fine. I thought it was as trivial as jaywalking or one of those other things. “I guess it was just ego. I had a completely clean record but there was this fine, and my godfather who was sitting with me as we were having lunch one day said 'Well, you can put my name for this'. So I said, 'Oh okay, that’s a good idea'. We were still going to pay the fine anyway. I didn’t think anyone was hard put by it and we just forgot about the incident.” \"IT WAS LIKE A HONG KONG DRAMA\" He suspects what brought it to the attention of the authorities a few years later were the actions of one his former employees, who he says was stealing from his practice. He confronted her but she denied wrongdoing. Eventually he fired her and reported her to the police. She was sent to jail but not before she “vowed vengeance”, he says. “She said to me, 'I will one day see you in jail as well'. It was like a Hong Kong drama being unfolded before my eyes.” She had witnessed the conversation between Dr Wu and his godfather about the traffic offence, he adds. “She had written a couple of complaints to various agencies saying I had abused her and I had to write back lengthy letters saying that she has stolen money from us and she is currently under investigation, that she is currently in jail, and that these are fictitious complaints. So they were all thrown by the wayside but finally she went to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and she alleged that I had bribed this elderly employee.” Dr Wu was subsequently investigated.   “It’s not fun being investigated by them. It’s exactly like what you see in the movies with little cell with a glass window and you’re sitting on the chair and somebody is interrogating  you and your godfather is in the other room and you’re only allowed to look at each other briefly.  \"It was quite harrowing but the good thing is, they discovered that there was no wrongdoing of that nature. No money had changed hands, but I readily admitted to the putting his name on the traffic offence, which I shouldn’t have done.” LET OFF TOO LIGHTLY? Then came the public scrutiny. Was the S$1,000 fine commensurate to his offence, people asked? Was he being let off lightly because he was rich or because of his relationship with people in high places? The Attorney-General's Chambers had to issue a statement explaining its decision to charge Dr Wu under a section of the Road Traffic Act rather than under the Penal Code, which provides for stiffer penalties. Among the reasons for this was that Dr Wu could not have been charged under a section in the Penal Code for intentionally perverting the course of justice because he had committed his offence in 2006, before that particular section was enacted in 2008. Also, as there was no major accident or injury, it was considered appropriate to proceed under the Road Traffic Act and in general, fines or short custodial sentences are imposed for wilfully providing false information. The case was also discussed in Parliament. In response to questions, Law Minister Shanmugam cited six cases between 2004 and 2007, to show that the final result of Dr Wu's case was consistent with the verdict of the Court in those instances - where no jail term was imposed.  “A lot of people ploughed into it because it suddenly became fodder for the internet and people didn’t realise that the fine I was given was three times more than what it should’ve been for that period,\" says Dr Wu. “All they could see was that 'Hey, he only got a fine and some other people went to jail'. They were not comparing apples with apples because the people who went to jail over traffic offences were also people who had bribed other people to take the rap for them. So there was an exchange of money, which there wasn’t in this case.” He stayed away from the internet during that period because reading such reports was just “too distressing”. Then came the SMC’s decision to suspend him for four months. The SMC had said that he was unremorseful. I ask him why he came across that way. “I didn’t even bother to put up a fight because I’d accepted it. What I did was wrong. They asked me why I did it and I said honestly that I didn’t think it was a serious thing at that time. I had seen other senior people doing it. Even some senior doctors have done it and we just thought it was a trivial thing.” This explanation was construed as reflecting a lack of remorse. Dr Wu however says he was merely explaining why he had done it without meaning to justify his wrongdoing. I ask him why he never appealed the decision. “It was something that was said to me during that process, that the public was outraged by my behaviour and justice had to be seen to be done. So I thought, okay, these are my peers, these are my seniors and if they say that this is not up to their moral yardstick, I accept that and I just wanted to be as quiet as possible.” ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON During his four-month suspension, he says he concentrated on getting back to his life. “I like playing squash and the World Squash Championship Masters was coming up, so I was training for it and I just put medicine out of my mind for a while. I was also doing a little bit of teaching. People who wanted to learn about plastic surgery would come to me and I would give them lectures.” I wonder if he reflected on his actions and what had happened as a result. “Of course, I have reflected. I knew it was a silly thing to do but I never thought a traffic offence would derail my career to such a great extent. You either accept it and move on or you dig a hole and jump inside and cry. I’m not about to do that because my philosophy in life is you only got one life, you’re not coming back, you better live it while you can. “This incident also forced me to re-examine my relationship with people around me, who I value most. It drove home the point that your family is always there for you. The children and my wife are the beautiful things in my life.” When I ask if the incident affected his business, he says it’s hard to tell as the industry was going through other changes at the time as well. “That, together with unfavourable economic conditions at the time and the fact that people were becoming more budget-conscious and beginning to fly out of Singapore to do surgeries either in Bangkok or Malaysia, or Batam could have been the causes of the decline I saw in my business. Then there was this Korean wave of doctors coming into Singapore and setting up clinics, consulting with patients and then taking all the patients back to Korea to operate. “I think all of us noticed a huge downturn in our practices and whether or not this incident contributed significantly to it, I can’t really evaluate in an honest fashion.” But clearly, Dr Wu’s life encompasses much more than his traffic offence. LIFE IN LONDON We talk about the other facets of his life that he has shared in his book. He writes a great deal about how his upbringing has shaped who he is today. One pivotal moment was when at the age of 4, he left for London with his mother after his parents’ divorce. She went there to pursue a law degree. Life in London for them was not what many Singaporeans typically picture, he says. “They think I was privileged or going to a boarding school. But it wasn’t like that for us. The two of us struggled for six years, in a foreign land, moving from one room to another room. \"It was a function of how much money we had. It was all being paid for by my grandfather who’s a policeman and you can imagine policeman didn’t earn that much in those days, so we just really had to get by on the cheapest available housing which was a room.\" He recalls the living conditions with almost a sense of nostalgia.  “The way it worked in England in the 1960s was if you were renting a room, there’s no toilet with it. The toilet was outside on the landing. There was also no heating unless you put a coin into the machine. So there’s a little meter. You can see the meter ticking and you put in a couple of pennies and the heater comes on for a short while. In the cold of winter, you put a couple of pennies in, and when you’ve run out of pennies, you’ve just got to stay cold.” His mother was determined to complete her studies in spite of the financial difficulties. “I think my grandfather also really wanted her to continue her legal studies because he knew that she would be good at it and she was good at it.” He says it was challenging but sometimes “fun”. “When you’re living through it, it’s not as bad. There are moments. When you’re trying to get a bath and you finally do get a bath, even though it’s in a public toilet, it’s still a bath and you’re still quite thankful for it. I guess that helped to hone the kind of resilience that I hope I’ve displayed through my life. \"Maybe I’ve got a nomad in me, but we would pack everything up and  move to a new place and it was always kind of exciting for me to see whether this new place was better than the old place, making new friends in the neighbourhood and going to a new school.\"  However, the racism and xenophobia he experienced were not so pleasant.  Some of the people he encountered asked if Singaporeans lived in trees with the monkeys and whether his parents wore leaves for clothes.  His London experience also contributed to the unusual name Woffles sticking with him throughout his life. Prior to that, his mother who “had a thing for cute little names” had nicknamed him that, after a rabbit from the novel The Magic Faraway Tree by Enid Blyton. In school in London, nobody could pronounce his Chinese name, Tze Liang. So he told them to go with his nickname. HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PARENTS Much of his childhood was spent hoping his parents would get back together. “For a brief period when we came back to Singapore and had been visited by my father a couple of times, I used to see that they got on pretty well. They could still laugh at each other and they could still crack jokes with each other so I was hoping that maybe they would rekindle something. But it didn’t happen.” His father would visit, but every time he left, it was “heartbreaking”, says Dr Wu. While he longed for life with a father, some things about his dad bothered him. “One of the main problems with my father and our relationship at that time was that whenever he spoke to me, or called me on the phone or even came down to visit us in our house in Singapore, he was always drunk. If you’ve ever experienced trying to have a conversation with somebody who’s really off his rocker, it’s very frustrating.” He assures me that his father, who was an airline pilot at the time, was not an alcoholic, but merely enjoyed drinking while he was off-duty. His father remarried and had more children with his second wife. When he died, he left an equal share of his estate to Dr Wu, something that made him realise that his father indeed thought of him as one his children even though they had been largely apart. One of his enduring regrets is judging his father too harshly.  \"Now as an adult and being married, I realise the difficulty of maintaining a relationship with one person over many, many years. I can begin the understand how different my parents were as personalities. My mother probably had one set of expectations which he couldn’t fulfil and he probably had another image of her.\" WHY PLASTIC SURGERY? Aside from family, naturally, his medical career is a vital part of his story. Many of his aunts and uncles were doctors and their influence attracted him to the profession, however plastic surgery stood out for him for very specific reasons. “I’m naturally a creative person and in my life, I love art and I paint as well. I realised that I had to come back to the creative aspect. I knew I didn’t want to be just sitting there, make a diagnosis and give medicine, then wait for it to work. I wanted to do something with my hands. So it meant something surgical and since I have a natural eye for beauty, it just became second nature to me.” Like many plastic surgeons, he started off in reconstructive surgery. “That’s a huge branch and all of us trained as reconstructive surgeons. Whether we treat burns or treat cancers, breast cancers, cleft lips, all of these fall under plastic surgery. If you’re restoring a patient to normality, you have to do it with an aesthetic eye. But this is where you learn all your skills.” He acknowledges of course that aesthetic surgery - “making somebody who’s already normal, look better for whatever reason, either to look younger or to physically look better” - is a different ball game. When I put it to him that plastic surgeons are merely capitalising on people’s insecurities, he says he sees it differently. “We are all, to a certain extent, insecure about something in ourselves. What have we turned to in the past to address this? Make-up, hairstyle, fashion. So now, you have the ability through medical science, to change certain features in your face, to give you that self-confidence that you were looking for and I think that makes a huge difference in peoples’ lives.  \"We have to understand that looks aren’t important to everybody. But they are important to certain people. We have to be understanding of different peoples needs and we can't use one yardstick for everybody.\" However, he does draw a line in certain cases.   “People with body dysmorphic disorder obviously need psychological help. I don’t do surgery or cosmetic procedure on everybody who walks in my door. Some people have a lack of self-confidence when actually there’s no reason to because their face looks perfectly all right If I feel that this is not going to benefit you aesthetically, or if the risk of getting there is too high, I will dissuade you from doing it.” He also encourages moving away from subscribing to specific ideals of beauty. “Many people used to think that there is an ideal face for everybody in the world and one of the movements that I’ve been a part of in the last 15 to 20 years has been to tell people that we are all beautiful in our own way and we shouldn’t be judged by just strictly a Caucasian standards. “I try to keep my beauty parameters within each ethnic group. So if you look at the Chinese or you look at the Indians, there are really, really gorgeous Chinese, Indian and Malay faces and then there are the others which look a little flatter or a little broader or not so attractive and I try to move people up the aesthetic scale for that ethnicity. I’m not into making an Asian look like a Caucasian. I think that’s going over the limit.” As a doctor, he has had a few lawsuits brought against him by patients in the last few years. He puts it down to unrealistic expectations in spite of the fact that he goes through “a full list of complications” and even shows patients “pictures of complications”. “If somebody is doing a breast reduction, I will show them a picture of a breast where somebody’s nipple has died or where the wound has split open and I’ll tell them that this is a potential complication that you could encounter. Do you still want to go ahead with the surgery? And then you begin to determine how firm they are in their minds about having a certain procedure. “Some think that a plastic surgeon is a god-like person who can just wave a magic wand and they will look exactly the way they want. However, plastic surgery is a science and it’s a surgical science which means that no two individuals are going to heal in the same way, no two individuals will have swelling in the same way. Everybody looks a little different.” In 2014, a patient sued him for negligence, claiming she was persuaded to undergo facial treatment that resulted in pain, suffering and complications. “What transpired was that she had been to see other doctors previously and she had these creams from them. She was applying them inappropriately with the creams that we had given her. So she basically burnt her face. It went to court and was thrown out.” But such news, he admits, has affected business.  \"This is where being positive about your life helps you to cope with these things. At one point of my career, I had probably 30 or 40 patients in my clinic every day. Now there are far fewer patients. But I don’t allow it to bother me. I look at it as a blessing because it now means I have more time to do other things in my life, especially being with family, or doing the things that I love like playing squash. So I’m not hung up about sitting in the clinic.\"  He himself has not undergone any major aesthetic procedures and has no intentions to in the near future.  “I’ve had a little bit of botox to my forehead because I have a very wrinkly forehead but that’s about the only thing I’ve done. I do maybe a skin freshening once a year. I’m a very happy-go-lucky kind of person. So I wanted a countenance that goes with that. “As you age, things happen to you, and you can absolutely accept it gracefully. I play a lot of sports. I think sports helps the overall rejuvenation of the body. But sometimes, if you’re developing pigmentation for example, if you’re getting a big black spot on your face which just kind of makes you look not optimal, then there’s no harm in doing a bit of a laser or a bit of IPL just to get rid of it.” Aside from the art and the science, he has concerns about the business of plastic surgery. As more go overseas for more affordable aesthetic procedures, he feels more needs to be done to level the playing field for doctors operating in Singapore. “Currently, aesthetic doctors in Singapore are not even allowed to put a before and after photograph on our website. It’s considered ethically wrong and when we asked why, the SMC said it’s laudatory. How is patient education illustrated by a photograph of a person without double eyelids and then another of what they look like with double eyelids, laudatory? It is just educating the public as to what they can expect. Patients or potential patients are only going to click on a website that has pictures and since everywhere else in this region doctors are allowed to freely advertise before and after pictures, patients end up going to these doctors.” He admits however that doing such procedures in Singapore is definitely more expensive than in other countries. “But I think the overall standard of aesthetic surgery here is very high. I mean it’s comparable to some of the best cities in America or in London, Paris. I don’t think we lose out to many other people.” RETURNING TO HIS ROOTS He hopes to soon return to his roots doing reconstructive and corrective surgery. He recently got a license to practice in China and is looking into doing pro bono work there.   \"Treating reconstructive patients and treating patients who are not necessarily coming to you just to look even better. That gives me a sense of satisfaction and in recent years as I’ve gone back to China more often to do these operations that I used to do before, it’s brought back that feeling of satisfaction, gratitude and reminded me why I went into medicine in the first place. It’s given me a modicum of satisfaction that is missing when you’re just treating cosmetic patients.” Writing his book has also reignited a love for the arts. He is working on two film projects for which he is writing screenplays. One is about an elderly lorry driver who loses his wife and as a result, his will to live. His friends introduce him to a woman from China and hence begins an exploration of stereotypes in modern Singapore society. The other film is about an obsessive toy collector. Both projects have been in making for many years. He says they were put on hold because the problems he faced over the traffic offence saga wrecked his peace of mind for several years. Today, it seems he is determined to put that behind him. “I try to live life as fully as I can now and I know we have setbacks. We’ve got speed bumps along the way. We have to drive over or navigate them. The traffic incident was one. There will be many more. If you’re going to dwell on them and just be morose and mope about things, it doesn’t help things very much so I try to be very positive, even in the face of adversities.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woffles-wu-singapore-plastic-surgeon-on-the-record-10586278"}, {"datetime": "04 Aug 2018 11:00PM", "tags": ["US", "China", "trade", "Vivian Balakrishnan"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Singapore has conveyed concerns about US-China trade tensions to both countries: Vivian Balakrishnan", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore has conveyed its concerns to both the US and China about the rising trade tensions between the two powers, Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Saturday (Aug 4). Speaking to reporters during a press conference at the conclusion of a series of meetings between members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and external powers, Dr Balakrishnan explained that any trade war or unilateral sanctions will have a “disproportionate impact” on Singapore. Singapore has good relations with both the US and China, he said, and has “courteously and directly” expressed its position to both of them, he said, in response to questions from reporters. “Obviously, we don’t control the agenda of their decisions, but for what it is worth, we conveyed our concerns.” Dr Balakrishnan's comments come amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China. In early July, the US imposed 25 per cent tariffs on US$34 billion (S$46 billion) of Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory tariffs on an equivalent volume of US exports to China.  On Friday (Aug 3), China said it was prepared to impose new tariffs on US$60 billion worth of American goods.  Dr Balakrishnan explained that Singapore believes in a multilateral, rules-based system, and noted that “in an ideal world”, everyone resolves their differences on trade through the World Trade Organisation (WTO), or at least in a WTO-compliant fashion. “It’s not exactly identical to what the US or China may want, but Singapore gets to state what we believe in, because we say the same thing to both sides, they know that we are being transparent and honest, and we are not playing games,” he said.  He added that this position is “entirely consistent” with that of the ASEAN regional bloc. NEED FOR ASEAN TO “DOUBLE DOWN” ON MULTILATERAL TRADE SYSTEMS  During the press conference, Dr Balakrishnan noted that ASEAN acknowledges the escalating trade tensions around the world, and stressed that ASEAN has to “double down” on a multilateral trading system and work with other like-minded partners. To that end, he said he is glad that there is agreement to redouble efforts to settle the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) by the end of the year. The RCEP is a 16-nation pact poised to become the world’s largest free-trade agreement. It would bring together the 10 ASEAN member states plus China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.  “It doesn’t mean that negotiations are over or that there are no sticky issues, but at least the political will...the acknowledgement that this is something which we need to settle, and all the more so, given the state of the world and the anxiety over trade wars,” he said. In response to a further question on what these “sticky issues” are, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that the “one missing element” is that China and India do not currently have a bilateral free trade agreement. “If they agree to the RCEP, in effect they are setting the stage to liberalise the trade of goods and services between India and China,” he said. “Now, dealing with two mega continental-sized economies, I think it is entirely reasonable to have to be very, very careful, given the size, that disparity, that diversity.” “There is good reason for them to very carefully calculate what they are agreeing to,” he added. \"SMOOTHEST, MOST CONSTRUCTIVE MEETINGS SO FAR\" During the press conference, Dr Balakrishnan described the meetings this week as the “smoothest, least contentious and most constructive, positive meetings so far.” “The tone was far more constructive, far more positive this year,” he said. “But at the same time, it allowed all the issues to be discussed very openly.” He added that the superpowers present “did not pull any punches”, but it nevertheless took place in a “safe, constructive and comfortable forum”. This, he said, illustrates the importance of ASEAN. Frank discussions, he added, also took place during the meetings, for example on the topic of the Korean Peninsula. Describing the discussions on this issue as “very candid” and “brutally frank”, Dr Balakrishnan noted that the US, North Korea and South Korea have “major issues” that they need to resolve. But nevertheless, he said, people acknowledged that there has been some progress, and the Jun 12 Singapore Summit did “change the tone of the conversation”. Dr Balakrishnan also described ASEAN and China’s arrival at a single draft negotiating text on the South China Sea code of conduct as a “significant milestone”.  He added that the single draft made a “big difference” to the tone of the discussion on the topic this time, as compared to previous ASEAN meetings. NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING ASEAN TO BECOME PROXY STATES In response to a question from the media on whether ASEAN is at risk of becoming an arena for big power rivalry to play out, Dr Balakrishnan noted that the question alludes to whether there will be a resumption of the old Cold War, and whether ASEAN would end up being proxy states entangled in the “diplomatic, strategic and defence entanglements” of the superpowers. “We have no intention of allowing that to happen,” he said. “And hence, we have ASEAN.” “Hence we will be united, we will be relevant, we will maintain centrality and we will continue to convene these regional and extra-regional platforms,” he said. He added that all the superpowers were represented, and were able to express their demands, anxieties and hopes “quite frankly” during the closed-door sessions. “Rather than looking at this as a competitive situation where we all just become proxies, our concept of being united, central, open and inclusive, and welcoming trade and investments with all parties is in fact precisely the right response,” he said. “And this is what we have communicated unequivocally to all our external partners including the superpowers.” “I think they appreciate our position,” he added. “No one has said they would rather have a disunited ASEAN, or that ASEAN breaks up into rival blocs.” “In the case of Singapore, precisely because we are so small, I think our role as an honest broker has been appreciated, and has allowed us to be relevant beyond our geographical boundaries.” Dr Balakrishnan also revealed to reporters that an agreement has been reached to conclude negotiations on the ASEAN-European Union comprehensive Air Transport Agreement by the end of the year. Negotiations for an ASEAN-European Union Free Trade Agreement will also be negotiated.

Beijing threatened Friday to bring in the levies on products ranging from beef to condoms, after US President Donald Trump's administration upped the ante in its plans for additional tariffs on Chinese goods worth US$200 billion. Washington suggested the rate on the proposed extra tariffs could be increased from 10 to 25 per cent. The two countries have been embroiled for months in a trade conflict that has threatened to hurt consumers in both countries. Washington claims that China's export economy benefits from unfair policies and subsidies, as well as theft of American technological know-how. Speaking on the sidelines of a a Southeast Asian security conference also attended by the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Singapore, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China's threat of retaliatory tariffs was \"fully justified and necessary\". \"These are measures taken out of the consideration for upholding the interests of the Chinese people,\" he said, speaking through a translator. He said the move was also aimed at upholding the \"global free trade regime\" that was underpinned by the World Trade Organization. Wang also hit back at comments by top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who ridiculed China's tariff threat as \"weak\" and said the world's second-largest economy was in significant \"trouble\". \"As to whether China's economy is doing well or not, I think it is all too clear to the whole international community,\" Wang said, adding that China contributed a huge amount to global economic growth.  \"I don't see why he would come to the conclusion that China's economy is not doing well.\" In early July, the US imposed 25 per cent tariffs on US$34 billion of Chinese goods, with another US$16 billion to be targeted in coming weeks, sparking retaliatory measures from China. Days later, Washington unveiled a list of another US$200 billion in Chinese goods, from areas as varied as electrical machinery, leather goods and seafood, that would be hit with 10 per cent import duties. But Trump raised the stakes this week with his threat to lift the tariff rate. China has said new duties will be applied only if Washington pulls the trigger on its new tariffs. The Republican president has been keen to show he is tough on trade ahead of tricky congressional elections in November - but there are growing signs of concern in the White House that the dispute could affect Trump's political base.

Why so resistant, Singaporeans?", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mention the phrase “healthy hawker food” to a typical Singaporean on the street, and images of sterile bowls of bland noodles with awkward lettuce leaves may conjure to mind. Indeed, in our society, the word “healthy” has grown to become synonymous with “bland-tasting” over the years. With chronic lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases on the rise, and a well-documented role of diet in the prevention and management of these conditions, how then can we work towards changing deep-rooted mindsets and setting Singaporeans on the path towards a healthier lifestyle? An obvious choice of strategy that comes to mind is to start by altering the environment where Singaporeans frequent, which are the hawker centres, due to their relative affordability and accessibility. However, as public healthcare workers may have quickly come to learn, working with hawkers to effect changes is not an easy task.   KILLING THE HAWKER VIBE? Having spent years of serving up and perfecting traditional dishes, the hawkers take pride in their recipes, which have garnered a strong customer base over the years. As hawkers struggle to find their footing in the face of increasing rental and food prices, charting into unfamiliar grounds of serving up healthy hawker food may also inevitably be assigned a lower priority. Meanwhile, Singapore, with its diverse and culturally rich dishes to offer, has gained its reputation as a food paradise. Singaporeans are known to flock to stalls where queues are among the longest, placing emphasis on the taste and authenticity of local food. Hence, there is the sentiment that hawker centres should be left to their own devices, as healthier changes in the hawker centres may be “killing the hawker vibe”. After all, are there not already healthy eating places such as salad bars, which serves the purpose for those seeking healthier choices? There are also the feelings of familiarity and comfort associated with consuming the traditional favourites, along with pleasant memories of enjoying these together with family or friends, which are difficult to detach. BUT WAIT, LET’S LOOK AT HEALTH SURVEYS However, with the 2010 National Nutrition Survey showing a majority of Singaporeans consuming hawker food, with 60 per cent having it for lunch or dinner at least four times each week, there is pertinent need to improve food choices in hawker centres. Similarly, according to the Food Forward Trends Report in 2014 by Weber Shandwick, 81 per cent of Singaporeans surveyed said they opt for hawker food most often when they eat out. One solution to improve the diet of Singaporeans without rocking the boat would be to provide healthier alternatives at hawker centres, without phasing out traditional hawker favourites.  As it is the thing we do day-to-day that makes a difference, if we are able to select healthier choices most of the time, we would not have to eliminate these traditional favourites completely. HUGE CHALLENGE TO CONVINCE SINGAPOREANS, NOT JUST HAWKERS Despite the challenges abound, it is encouraging to see the Health Promotion Board staff reaching new grounds in the hawker centres, moving towards their target of getting 40 per cent of hawker stalls to offer at least one healthier dish by 2019. However, the colossal challenge remains to convince key stakeholders to embrace the change, which are Singaporeans themselves. With many Singaporeans already accustomed to the taste of rich hawker dishes, changing habits and taste preferences is not an easy feat. However, the good news is that given time, habits and taste buds can change. If Singaporeans are willing to step out of their comfort zone and try out the healthier hawker options, they may discover for themselves that they are just as capable of being tasty, wholesome and filling. They are also likely to develop a palate for healthier dishes over time, and learn to find a balance between the occasional treat foods. By offering consumers options, hawkers can create a platform for them to switch to healthier options when they are ready, such as by offering both brown and white rice options. As consumer demand grows, hawkers would also have greater incentives to offer healthier options. As the saying goes, “If not me, who? If not now, when?” If we can step forward to make a commitment towards improving our health, we can all work towards building a healthy environment for both our loved ones and ourselves.

Pompeo unveiled the figure to reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other officials from around the world in Singapore. \"As part of our commitment to advancing regional security in the Indo-Pacific, the United States is excited to announce nearly US$300 million dollars of new funding to reinforce security cooperation throughout the entire region,\" he said.  \"This new security assistance will advance our shared priorities, especially to strengthen maritime security, develop humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping capabilities and enhance programmes that counter transnational threats.\" The United States said earlier this week it will invest US$113 million in technology, energy and infrastructure initiatives in emerging Asia which he called \"a downpayment on a new era of US economic commitment to the region\".  The United States' developing vision for a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" comes at the same time as China ramps up its influence as part of is Belt and Road plan to bolster trade ties with nations in Southeast Asia and beyond. Analysts have said that a spiralling trade dispute between Beijing and Washington could also ratchet up tensions over other regional hotspot issues, such as the South China Sea, claimed in whole by China and in part by some Southeast Asian nations. China and ASEAN on Thursday hailed a \"milestone\" agreement on a single working text to kick off what will likely be protracted negotiations toward a code of conduct for behaviour the disputed waters. But critics have said that this enthusiasm for talks is a means for China to buy time and solidify its position during a period of relative dominance in the region. Pompeo told reporters that he had raised concerns at the meeting about Chinese militarisation of the South China Sea and the importance of maintaining a rules-based order in the region. The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, told reporters at the same forum that China welcomed, and was willing to work with, the United States to help with faster development and better security in the region. He added, however, that the United States had been sending \"massive strategic weaponry\" into the South China Sea and the region as a show of military might that puts pressure on China and other regional countries. \"That is the biggest force behind militarisation in this region,\" he said. Progress toward containing the humanitarian in crisis in Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state and other security issues were also essential to a free and open Indo-Pacific, he said. The use of \"Indo-Pacific\" has grown among diplomats from Japan, Australia, India and the United States in recent years, a shorthand for a democratic-led region, as opposed to an \"Asia-Pacific\" with China at its centre. MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA Pompeo also called for pressure to be maintained on North Korea as concerns mount that Pyongyang is making slow progress towards denuclearisation. In Singapore ahead of a major security forum, Pompeo called for \"maintaining diplomatic and economic pressure\" against Pyongyang. \"I call on (every nation) to strictly enforce all sanctions, including the complete shutdown of all illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum destined for North Korea,\" he said. \"Any violation that detracts from the world’s goal of finally fully denuclearising North Korea would be something that America would take very seriously.\" His North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, is also in the city-state for the ASEAN Regional Forum, which takes place later in the day. But Pompeo said he was yet to meet with him on the sidelines of the gathering. At a landmark summit with President Donald Trump in June, the North's leader Kim Jong Un signed up to a vague commitment to \"denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\". While there have been small signs of progress since the summit, news reports indicate Pyongyang is continuing to build rockets and there have been concerns that some member states are relaxing the enforcement of United Nations sanctions on the North. He also criticised Cambodia's polls last Sunday which saw the Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling National Election Committee sweep every seat contested. \"A free Indo-Pacific is one in which every citizen can exercise his or her fundamental rights without any constraint. Regarding the issue of governance, we regret the elections in Cambodia were neither free nor fair. The Cambodian people deserve better,\" Pompeo said.

Many others have responded generously, offering the family cash donations and to buy her brother’s paintings, following CNA Insider’s story about 50-year-old Sim Kah Lim, who has been institutionalised for nearly 35 years and paints old Singapore from memory. The possible chance, however, for him to reintegrate into society, as both siblings see it, has thrilled them the most. “I’m happy and touched that somebody recognised his talents, and is willing to give him a chance,” said Ms Sim. “It would be good for Kah Lim to get back into society, back to work and interacting with people. Now he’s still living in his own world. When people talk to him, he’d just interrupt.” WATCH: His gift unfettered (6:16)  But there are many other considerations to take into first, and she admitted that it was early days. The last time he was in any sort of job was as a 10-year-old helping an advertising company to paint movie posters and bus advertisements, before he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. “Nor has he gone out for a long time. I’m just a bit worried about whether he can cope,” added Ms Sim. Her brother, however, is already talking about using part of his future salary to employ a helper for their mother. WAITING ON DOCTORS’ ADVICE Ms Lum-Yu decided to offer Mr Sim help in the hope that he can “have a sustainable way of life”. Her new social enterprise ArtSE provides employment for individuals with special needs, especially artists. And having met him and his sister at the Institute of Mental Health, she was struck by his talent and knowledge of the old Singaporean painters. “Kah Lim is such a lovable person. We talked about artists; even the ones that we represent, he knows them. We had a lovely time talking,” she said. He was excited when they spoke about the possibility of employment, but she cautioned that “we want to take it slow”. She said: “We’ll wait for the doctors to advise us what days he can come out to work. “We’re going to impact on another person, and that’s what we’re looking forward to – it gives a greater meaning to what we’re doing.” The idea is to have a senior artist mentor Mr Sim at the gallery once or twice a week. He, too, could share his knowledge with budding artists, but that would depend on how ready he is. Ms Sim intends to take her brother out to crowded public places first, to observe how he interacts with others. She will also show him the art gallery to see if he likes the environment. Ascertaining whether he is ready for the job will take some time, while full reintegration is a long way off, she admitted, as a sudden return to society would be “a shock to the system”. MANY FACTORS IN CONSIDERING REINTEGRATION The first step, however, is for Ms Sim to work closely with the IMH doctors. “His consultant said it would be good if he can slowly integrate back into society, and he’d love to see if Kah Lim can progress to that stage,” she said. “I’d love for him to be out completely, but partially is good enough. Eventually, he can change for the better, to be completely okay. We’ll take it step by step. I’m still in good health – I can take care of him. When contacted, the IMH said that in assessing a patient’s readiness for reintegration, the care team would consider his clinical condition, the ability to support himself in the community in areas like home support, and the ability to do practical things like use public transport and money. The team must also consider the patient’s wish to return home or not, and whether there are carers around, such as family members. The IMH said its occupational therapists and vocational specialists assist individuals in their job search and placement when they are ready to take up employment, based on their interests and skills. Most collaborations are in the administrative, retail, food and beverage and cleaning settings, where there are more opportunities. “In addition to providing on-site job coaching to support clients at work, individual follow-up with clients is also carried out to help them identify and overcome any challenges they face at work,” said an IMH spokesperson. To date, 26 patients from its slow-stream rehabilitation ward have been discharged to their homes and community rehabilitation facilities. These patients are doing well and engaging with the IMH at the outpatient level, added the spokesperson, who declined to comment on Mr Sim’s case, citing patient confidentiality. OFFERS FROM U.S., NEW ZEALAND Apart from the job offer, as many as 80 people, including from the United States and New Zealand, have emailed Ms Sim to buy her brother’s paintings, donate art materials or even to commission him to paint something for them. Some have offered monetary assistance, but she referred them to the IMH. “So many people there also need help, not just Kah Lim. That’s not right. He could always sell his paintings if he needs more money,” she said. Some of his paintings have since been sold, but the details are being confirmed, she added. It’s very great – the responses from the public. Some even messaged me. The first week, I was very emotional. Ms Sim has created a website about her brother and diverted all the emails and queries there. She intends to photograph his paintings and catalogue them on the website for interested buyers. It is a work in progress, and she hopes to upload the pictures in the next month or so. She has not even had the time, however, to price his paintings. But she promised one thing: “I’ll also share updates about him and his progress.” Read Mr Sim's story here, and visit the website about him here. \n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/schizophrenia-imh-sim-kah-lim-artist-singapore-mental-health-job-10587096"}, {"datetime": "04 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["cna insider", "education"], "author": "Goh Chiew Tong", "title": "A sister’s sacrifice: At 22, she’s a sole breadwinner and ‘dad’ to 6 siblings", "content": " SINGAPORE: Every weekday night, Nur Aqilah Selamat packs leftovers for her “lunch” – to be taken when the rest of Singapore is fast asleep. “At 1.30am, I’ll be eating this,” she says, scooping rice and egg curry into a plastic container. “There’s nothing (else) for us at night because most of the shops are closed.” And, with a quick adjustment to her headscarf and a swipe of coral lipstick, she heads out for the hour-long commute to work, with twins Nur Lutfiana and Nur Lutfiani, 9, running up to say a quick goodbye to their big sister at the door. For about a year now, the 22-year-old has been an associate engineer at a semiconductor company, where her nine-hour shift starts at 10.45pm. She wanted these hours for they come with an extra allowance – meaning more money for her family. On her slender young shoulders rests the responsibility of providing for her mother and six younger siblings, aged 9 to 20. “Being the eldest is one thing; but my love for my siblings is another,” she said.  “In every little thing, I always think about them …. I don’t care much about myself at the moment. I want to do the best for them, just like how my dad did for me.” After her father retired as a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighter in 2014, the polytechnic graduate took it upon herself to be more than just a daughter and a sibling.  She became the family’s breadwinner, even to the exclusion of her youthful dreams for now. FROM STUDIES TO WORK When her father retired at the age of 52, he received a lump sum pension of about S$70,000. Though Ms Aqilah had just entered polytechnic then, she began to do the calculations about her family’s future. “If you have one child, it’s okay. But for the seven of us to go through that amount for a few years? It’s not enough,” she thought to herself. The one thing she did not have to worry about: School expenses for her younger siblings, whose fees, uniforms and textbooks were fully covered under the Ministry of Education’s Financial Assistance Scheme. “With this help, we could cut down a lot on daily expenses,” said Ms Aqilah. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Even so, without a steady stream of income, they had to find ways to reduce their household bills to not more than S$500 a month in total. She got them all to take shorter showers (five minutes each), minimise their use of air conditioning, and not charge their electronic devices for too long. “Little things can save a lot of money,” she said. “I could see the difference.” In 2017, after getting her diploma in aerospace engineering from Nanyang Polytechnic, she applied to local universities. While waiting, she looked for work to “save up a bit for university”. She found a job at a semiconductor company in next to no time, and expected to be working for six months at most. But, as the universities’ rejection letters came one after another, she realised she had to put her plans on hold and focus on working full-time instead. As a part-timer, she was earning about S$1,000. But if she were to convert to full-time employment, her take-home pay would be roughly double that including allowances. That made up her mind. Though she really wanted to get her degree, she said with her characteristic positivity: “I shouldn’t be disappointed because with my working experience, I know I can build my career to get a higher post or job.” FROM DAUGHTER TO DISCIPLINARIAN Becoming the family’s main source of income, however, was just one part of the role Ms Aqilah found herself stepping into. When her father decided to seek training overseas after leaving the SCDF, she became the ‘dad’ of the family in other ways. She has fashioned herself as a disciplinarian, scolding her siblings when it becomes necessary, such as if they are late home from school. “He passed on his responsibility to me, and I felt it had to be carried out for my siblings’ sake,” she said. So she makes it a point to stay abreast of how they are doing academically: Besides the twins in primary school, three other siblings are in secondary school (the sixth is in National Service.)  She goes to parent-teacher meetings with her mother, Madam Aktar Banu Mohamed Osman, 54, who is not highly educated and relies on her eldest to understand how her other children are faring. Nur Mursyida, 13, remembers how her big sister tutored her for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). The latter had wanted her siblings to get into her alma mater, Woodlands Ring Secondary, because she had good teachers and liked the culture there. These days with her sister working the night shift, said Mursyida: “She has no time because she would be very sleepy, so she sleeps maybe all day.” Ms Aqilah also handles all the financial matters at home – seemingly unfazed by tasks that, for many of her peers, “their parents would settle for them”. For instance, she ensures her family does not exceed their monthly budget; makes bill payments on time; and goes to the bank. “At first I was like, ‘I already have school, and now I’ve to take care of a lot of things,’” she said, a pile of utilities and telephone bills spread out on the coffee table before her. But at the same time, I was able to learn a lot of things by myself … so it’s kind of a good start at my age to have experienced all these things. As a mother, however, it is a bitter-sweet thing for Mdm Aktar Banu to watch her eldest daughter grow into her role. “I do feel sad looking at her,” she said. “But I could depend only on her. Her other siblings were still very young.” She added: “Aqilah has been taking care of her siblings since she was in kindergarten. I trained her so she can be independent.”  When her dad was at work and her mum out buying groceries, the youngster would watch over her brother and sister, helping to prepare their milk and diapers. It’s no wonder that mother and eldest daughter share the closest relationship and are like “best friends”. “She has always shared everything in her life with me… even now, anything that happens at her work place,” said the 54-year-old fondly. RESPONSIBILITIES NOT A BURDEN As much as she strives to fill her father’s shoes, however, Ms Aqilah frets that she can never be a perfect father figure, mainly because “a dad’s love is different from a sister’s love”. Like in any family, the siblings get into fights, especially with some in their turbulent teenage years. “Some of them think our age gap isn’t so big, so I’m more like a friend. A parent is someone you’d respect more,” said Ms Aqilah. Her face softened as she added: “But I’d never say anything hurtful. I don’t take things to heart.” The quietest time she has to herself is when she is back from work at about 8.30am and her siblings are at school. That’s when she kicks back and enjoys a movie or chats with her mother. Some days, fatigued from her night shift, sleep comes the moment her head hits the pillow. As a bit of sunlight spills into her darkened room around the edges of the curtains, she gets about six to eight hours of shut-eye. But uninterrupted sleep is a rare thing, especially once the twins get back at 1.30pm, followed by the others. “I’d wake up once in a while, like every hour … because when my siblings come home, noise is normal,” she said. “Sometimes I have to force myself to sleep.” Having any kind of a social life is difficult. She misses meeting her friends for dinner or going window-shopping in the evenings, which is when she wakes up to have dinner with her family and sometimes help her siblings with schoolwork. But, rather than pining for youthful freedom as her peers might do, she feels like a parent would about their children. “I don’t really see (these responsibilities) as much of a burden. I feel it’s something you can enjoy,” she said with sincere conviction. WATCH: Nur Aqilah's journey (5:04)  A LOAD OFF HER SHOULDERS While it seems like a huge responsibility for her young shoulders, one thing that has taken a significant part of the weight off is the help the family has received along the way. In particular, her five siblings’ school expenses – such as fees, textbooks and uniforms – are covered by MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS). The children started receiving assistance in 2013 as their father was earning S$4,000 a month, which worked out to a per-capita income well under the qualifying threshold of S$625 then – a criterion introduced in 2012 to benefit larger families like theirs. (Today, eligibility is based on either a gross household income of S$2,750 or less a month, or a per capita income of S$690 or less.) And under the School Meals Programme, in each school week, the primary-school-going twins enjoy subsidies of S$2 a meal for seven meals, while those in secondary school get S$2.50 a meal for 10 meals. The FAS also includes transport subsidies. As for Ms Aqilah herself, when she entered polytechnic in 2014, her annual tuition fees of about $2,400 were covered by Mendaki’s Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy. She received a S$3,000 annual bursary from NTUC Income‘s OrangeAid Future Development Programme in her final two years. The financial aid has not made the family complacent, however. Since young, the children have developed a habit of saving a portion of their weekly allowance. Each child has one, if not two, coin banks of various shapes and sizes. Holding up one shaped like a heart, which she has used since she was at secondary school, Ms Aqilah said with satisfaction: “The last (time) I counted, there was more than S$300.” Her siblings sometimes tap these savings to indulge in simple pleasures, like clothes or snacks. “You know the ice-cream uncle on a motorbike? They sometimes want to eat ice cream, so they’d take money out of their piggy banks,” she said, adding that they did not need any other financial assistance with the household expenses. A TEACHER-IN-WAITING? Even as her family’s needs preoccupy her, Ms Aqilah has not forgotten her dreams. She applied to university again this year, and hopes to pursue a teaching career some day. Teaching was her first love, and she had hoped to make it to junior college and then to the National Institute of Education (NIE). But when her grades landed her in polytechnic, even though one can apply to NIE with a diploma, she decided instead to pursue engineering as maths was her strongest subject. Her former teacher, Mr Soong Cheng Xiang, recalls how she would helpfully coach her classmates at Woodlands Ring Secondary in maths. “She would be very patient in clarifying their doubts, even if the questions were very simple ones,” he said. And it was Mr Soong who told her, after she qualified for polytechnic instead of JC, that he’d always seen her as “a future lecturer”. Ms Aqilah, who had all but given up on thoughts of becoming a teacher at that point, said:  My passion in teaching came back when he said that. It felt like he understood me, my inner self. His final words to her at a recent reunion: “Serve to the best of your ability. What our school taught us was to be a worthy person, be someone who selflessly contributes to society.” For now, she taps into that nurturing side of her in her workplace. Though the youngest in her team, she has been tasked to train newcomers and show them the ropes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At home, she takes the time to tutor her younger siblings. But like any teacher should, she ensures that they learn independently too. “It isn’t good to spoon-feed,” she said. “They have their own examinations to go through. And during exams, you don’t have your parents beside you.” Ultimately, her goal is to see her siblings excel in school – and in life. “With all the help they’ve already received from the FAS, they don’t have to worry so much about the burden on them,” she said. “And they can focus on their studies now that I’m already working. “(Attaining) good results wasn’t easy for me, especially when I had to juggle a lot of things … I tried my best, but I know they can do better than I.” This story by CNA Insider was done in partnership with Gov.sg. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/breadwinner-aqilah-six-siblings-woodlands-financial-assistance-10585708"}, {"datetime": "04 Aug 2018 06:12AM", "tags": ["badminton", "recycle"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "The elderly shuttlecock recycler on a mission to produce a badminton world beater", "content": " SINGAPORE: With three snips of his cutter, 83-year-old Ronald Cheong removes a good feather from an otherwise tattered shuttlecock. During his heyday in the 1950s, the former national shuttler would have only needed three swings of his racquet to send his opponent scrambling on the court. “Although they played slowly, the judgment and accuracy was there,” Mr Cheong told Channel NewsAsia at a noisy void deck in Sengkang, insisting that badminton was played more tactically those days. “You can be very good friends off the court, but on the court you are his enemy. The weapon given to you is the racquet, and the bullets are the shuttles. So you have to make sure that he gets into problems with the shuttle.”  For Mr Cheong, even the most torn-up bullets have a use. With his frail fingers he stores the feather in a clear, plastic box. It will be used to refurbish other shuttlecocks. The man has been recycling shuttlecocks for more than 60 years, since he left the national team to become a coach. He started doing it because he wanted to reuse them for his students to practise with. At his age, Mr Cheong hardly plays. But that hasn’t stopped him from pursuing his side hobby. It is a way for him to get more young people to play the game he loves so much. Mr Cheong sometimes gives the refurbished shuttles to tuition centres, often under the guise of getting students to go outside. “Your students only sit down and study,” he would say. “Why not you take this, get racquets and play?” But his real aim is far more ambitious. “I hope that there will be a time when we have our own Singaporean to be a world beater,” he said. CUTTER, PLIER AND GLUE For decades Mr Cheong has been waiting for this to happen, although according to him, no one has come close to Wong Peng Soon, the three-time Thomas Cup and four-time All England Open winner. It is a big dream, but one that starts small – with a short LRT ride from his Sengkang block to the interchange, then a much longer bus ride from there to Bedok. About twice a week, Mr Cheong commutes to a sports hall in Bedok to gather old shuttlecocks. He’s lived and played there for many years, so the regulars know him very well. He gets their used shuttlecocks without asking. He picks up what’s left behind too. In a good week, Mr Cheong can get about two dozen shuttlecocks. “I take everything,” he said. “What you can use, you use. The ones you can’t, you throw.” Back at the void deck under his block, Mr Cheong spends his mornings getting to work. He lays out the used shuttlecocks on a piece of newspaper, picks out the decent-looking ones and cuts out the damaged feathers. Then, he uses pliers and glue to insert new feathers from his stash, before leaving the shuttles in the sun to dry. It sounds straightforward, but Mr Cheong must ensure the new quills have the same thickness as the rest. If not, he uses a penknife to carve off the excess. The entire process can take around 20 minutes per shuttlecock. But not all the shuttles can be saved. With heavy hitting so common in the sport today, they typically come with more than half of their 17 feathers broken, he lamented. Out of 24 shuttles, he might only salvage five. While it is short change for what seems like a painstaking process, Mr Cheong keeps going. Besides the children, he gives the shuttles to fellow seniors who play for leisure too. These refurbished shuttles also work just as well as the new ones, he suggested, something his playing partners have confirmed. “Some of them want to pay for it,” he said. “I said, forget it.” But they insisted, and so he lets them go for S$12 a dozen. “I don’t want to say that I am making something out of it,” he continued. “The passion is to build better badminton players in the young.” REACHING THE TOP, ALMOST As a young boy, Mr Cheong was crazy about badminton. The Peranakan Chinese grew up in Joo Chiat, in a house flanked on each side by an outdoor badminton court. At age 7, he picked up the sport and was soon playing almost every day, “from early morning till evening”. He sparred feverishly with his cousin, a competitive player who was sponsored by a racquet company. After it rained, Mr Cheong would quickly wipe the courts with gunny sacks. Night time? No problem. His father had fixed lights on the court. It had become an obsession, and naturally, his dad wasn’t too happy, demanding his son hit the books instead. “If he makes a noise, you just stand there and listen,” Mr Cheong said, chuckling and pointing to his right ear, then left. “It goes in here, comes out there. He walks away nicely, I just forget about it, and continue what I am doing.” Continued he did, until he developed a flair for the sport, even without formal coaching. “Nobody taught me,” he said. “Nobody told me this stroke is wrong – I learnt it myself.” Mr Cheong even played through the war, especially as he didn’t need to venture far to do so. Since his father was a village leader at the time, the Japanese didn’t bother them either. After the war ended, Mr Cheong started playing in junior then senior tournaments for the Anglo-Chinese School team, beating opponents older than him. By 17, he had been scouted for the national team. It was then that he thought he could eke out a living from badminton. “I felt that this sport was a very free and easy game,” he said. But his meteoric rise stalled as quickly as it started. During tournaments, Mr Cheong kept finding himself on the reserves. For some reason, his coach always seemed to favour two to three other singles players. Still, he remained hopeful that his team would win titles and produce the next Wong Peng Soon. It never happened. “The players chosen did not shine,” he said. “I could have made it, but at that time there was no spirit in me to go further, because when you are put on reserve so many occasions, you just get frustrated.” Mr Cheong left the squad in his 20s, but he has no regrets. “I think I have done my best playing and now it’s time to give back in any form,” he said. DRIFTING APART If there’s one thing that Mr Cheong has left to offer, it’s the sheer amount of knowledge he has about badminton. Similar to how he picked up the sport on his own, nobody taught him how to refurbish the shuttlecocks. “I only looked at it and saw that it could be done,” he said. “It’s my own knowledge that came with the experience of playing.” As Mr Cheong explained how a broken shuttlecock would flutter in the wind, he couldn’t resist diving deeper. He elaborated on serve techniques, dished out numbers on weight and tension, and rattled off names of pre-independence national players. It wasn’t a surprise then that he went down the coaching route. For a number of years Mr Cheong trained kids under a couple of national badminton programmes, and he enjoyed it. The money wasn’t as good as it is now, but he said this was secondary. “I hoped to pass it on to future generations who are interested in the game,” he reiterated. But Mr Cheong would soon discover it would be difficult to sustain that passion. His dad, discovering that he had too much free time, asked him to get a proper job. He found work in a shipping firm, then a telecommunications company, but still managed to coach on Sundays. Then, Mr Cheong got a letter inviting him to interview for a better-paying job working for the Government. He passed the interviews, and it was too good to turn down. “I still played during my free time, but I was consumed by work,” he said, adding that he had three round-the-clock shifts to cover. “I should have played more and got more people to play the game, but during work it was very hard to find time.” ILLNESS AND BROKEN TIES While he retired from the civil service aged 62, the setbacks didn’t stop. During a medical check-up, doctors diagnosed Mr Cheong’s wife with advanced stage ovarian cancer. To pay for her medical bills, he used up all his savings and sold his Bedok flat. “It was a huge sum of money,” he said, his trademark chirpy and playful tone gone. “I didn’t want to owe people money.” For the next four-and-a-half years, Mr Cheong looked after his wife every day. “I tried within my means,” he said, even seeking alternative medicine on top of the chemo and radiotherapy. She eventually died in 2006. Mr Cheong was all alone. He said he hasn’t heard from his son and daughter, both living overseas, in a very long time either. “To talk about my children is also very hard,” he said quietly. When asked if he’d like for them to reach out, he replied: “I hope that they will do it. But they have not done so for 40 over years.” Nevertheless, Mr Cheong said he’s grateful that a family who used to live in the same Joo Chiat area took him in after his wife died. He’s been living with them ever since. “I have a family who provides everything for me, I don’t have to ask more,” he said. “They are my godchildren.” HOPES AND DREAMS Mr Cheong might have gone through quite a bit, but his love for badminton never faltered. Since he retired, he has started playing more regularly again. For the past three months, he’s been playing once a week with some friends in Choa Chu Kang, but only if they’re able to book a court. Mr Cheong said he’s unhappy with the current booking system. There should be a few hours in the evening reserved for seniors, he suggested. However, he’s not playing as much now because he wants to refurbish more shuttlecocks. After a Facebook post on him went viral, he’s had a huge jump in orders. But he needs a lot more used shuttles to meet the demand. “I did not really expect people to want to try or play with it,” he said. “For all those who asked for it, I will do my best.” Back in the heartlands, Mr Cheong does his best to execute a smash in a friendly rally with a neighbour. Then he stretches his wiry frame and hits a few wayward shots, laughing and joking with his opponent. But his determination to return the shuttlecock, evidence of his competitive streak from days long gone, is still present. It might be easier to believe he’s 83 when he sits alone at the table each morning, fiddling with his tools and shuttles. He said people walking by sometimes stop to say things like: “Wow, you are clever ah.” “They will say it in some language which I don’t understand, but know,” he added, referring to Hokkien or Mandarin, languages he doesn’t speak because he is a Baba. “I appreciate that, but I hope they will tell people around the area that somebody is doing this and get their children and grandchildren to play the sport. “And that’s how a small population can get a few top-level players.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/elderly-shuttlecock-recycler-produce-badminton-world-beater-10586304"}, {"datetime": "04 Aug 2018 06:10AM", "tags": ["South China Sea", "ASEAN", "China", "Code of Conduct"], "author": "Koh Swee Lean Collin", "title": "Commentary: A sober assessment of the recent 'breakthrough' on the South China Sea", "content": " SINGAPORE: A breakthrough was reached on Thursday (Aug 2).  Following the adoption of a draft framework on the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea last August, barely a year later, China and the ten Southeast Asian countries of ASEAN agreed this week on a single draft document that will serve as a “living document and the basis of future code of conduct negotiations”. Describing this new development as “yet another milestone”, Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said that the parties arrived at the first draft during talks held a couple of months back in Changsha, China. Besides this single draft text, the 11 foreign ministers also agreed on the key modalities for future rounds of negotiations. This is certainly a noteworthy development. But it is necessary to look past the fist pumps and delve into the realities. Of course, the apparent rapid progress since August last year – from adoption of the draft framework to commencement of negotiations in March this year and then agreement of a single draft text this month – gives the impression of all things going well so far. But is this really so? REALITIES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA 'GROUND ZERO' True, there has been no more reported incidents of major aerial and maritime standoffs registered since August last year. But it does not mean the concerned parties have truly stopped whatever they have been doing, short of building new artificial islands. Against the backdrop of regular wargames of varying force size in the South China Sea, Beijing has upped the ante where it comes to boosting its military presence in the area – deploying long-range missiles to the Spratly Islands, landing strategic bombers in the Paracel Islands, and testing electronic jammers in the disputed waters over the past year. Such developments were unprecedented. And it was precisely because such actions ran counter to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s 2015 Rose Garden pledge to refrain from militarising the South China Sea, that the Chinese Navy was disinvited from the multilateral Rim of the Pacific exercise in Hawaii this year. Chinese officials howled protest at this move, at the same time emphasising that non-participation in RIMPAC is a small price to pay for safeguarding the country’s sovereign rights and interests in the South China Sea. The disinvite may have been a major loss of face for Beijing. Yet, already beleaguered by the trade row with the United States, and international “debt trap” controversies surrounding Chinese overseas investments couched under the Belt and Road Initiative, it is not entirely unimaginable to think that the Chinese Government needs a foreign policy win – something that can help mollify the bad press it has received to date. Not to forget that with the island-building work complete and fortifications mostly in place, all Beijing has to do is to further consolidate its gains in the South China Sea. So it finds itself now in a much stronger position to encourage progress, instead of foot-dragging, on the issue. ASEAN TRYING TO STAY BUOYANT Meanwhile, it is not difficult to see that ASEAN has every incentive to push for the single draft text. With the ongoing militarisation in the disputed waters and potential escalation in the future, the urgency felt by the bloc to make continued progress on the Code of Conduct is real. ASEAN too has to ensure its relevance. Progress on the Code of Conduct is key, indispensable, and almost like a “litmus test”. It’s no surprise different ASEAN countries took different national positions as they work towards the draft text. Vietnam offered the strongest opposition to Beijing’s activities whereas there was little sign of serious resistance from other ASEAN member states. The Philippines, which oversaw the promulgation of the draft framework last August in its earlier capacity as ASEAN chair, certainly has a significant role to play. Taking over from Singapore after Thursday’s meeting to now serve as the bloc’s coordinator of ASEAN-China relations, Manila has every reason to facilitate this outcome if one notes recent developments on the South China Sea confronting President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces enormous pressure to do something on this front. A recent Social Weather Station survey last month showed that four out of five Filipinos rejected the Duterte administration’s inaction on the issue, and 87 per cent of Filipinos polled wanted the government to regain control of the disputed waters. Amidst public doubts over the lack of transparency on the Filipino government’s relations with China, Manila even had to clarify that there were no “secret deals” reached with Beijing on the South China Sea dispute. NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY That said, ASEAN countries would have likely agreed to reach a single draft text for the code to help ease subsequent negotiations. In any case, they can reserve their positions. The devil still lies in the details – the wordings, language and tone that determine the texture of the eventual mechanism that all 11 countries deem fit to agree on. So the prospect of an eventual promulgation of this Code of Conduct is uncertain at best. Until the code is agreed upon, we can foresee that short of provoking major incidents in the disputed waters, the various claimants – not least China – will continue business-as-usual with their current set of activities, which could still be after all couched under the ambiguous and debatable notion of “defensive preparations”. The likelihood of a maritime or aerial incident in the future also cannot be discounted, notwithstanding this latest progress on the Code of Conduct.  Any miscalculation on the ground in such a contingency may potentially result in escalatory actions that may have dire consequences – possibly to the point of even derailing negotiations on the code. As such, while observers may expend time ruminating over the details of the code, in the interim it is necessary for countries to get on with existing confidence-building measures - for example the inaugural ASEAN-China maritime exercise, the table-top phase of which is being held this week in Singapore and the field training phase is slated for later this year. This activity will be based on the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), adopted at the Western Pacific Naval Symposium in 2014 in Qingdao. CUES in particular will remain a significant bulwark against close-proximity encounters between opposing forces which will still continue to operate in the South China Sea. While talks on the Code of Conduct persist, it is essential to not only implement CUES but also push for an expanded participation, especially among regional countries including those who are not signatories to this naval mechanism. Whether the Code of Conduct materialises eventually, CUES in more holistic forms – extended to the aerial and underwater dimensions, and involving maritime law enforcement agencies – will become ever more critical in guaranteeing peace and stability in the South China Sea, and securing understanding among forces on the ground in avoiding conflict.

He would take up arms in jihad to protect and free the Muslims there. If it came down to it, he would die a martyr and go to heaven. “I wanted to do something meaningful in my life,” he said. So too, did fellow Singaporean “Kenny\", who saw himself joining a militant group to save women and children in Syria. “I was just thinking to do my part, do as much as I can to help the people over there,” he explained.  And Kenny was similarly prepared to die - except, in his case, while battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the ubiquitous terror group that is one of several factions in the ongoing war. Neither Irfan nor Kenny ever reached Syria. They were picked up by the authorities under the Internal Security Act (ISA) - which detains or restricts radicalised individuals for up to two years, before the order is renewed or allowed to lapse. Since 2002, close to 90 individuals have been detained for terrorism-related activities with about three-quarters released since, said the Ministry of Home Affairs. As of Jun 20, there were 21 detained and another 21 issued with Restriction Orders (RO). There have been several cases in recent months - for instance, a local parking warden was detained in April and a Malaysian airfreight driver repatriated in January. In a series of interviews facilitated by the Internal Security Department (ISD), Channel NewsAsia and other selected local media met with former ISA detainees. Aliases were used and information that could give away the identities of the formerly radicalised Singaporeans was protected. “I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT IT THROUGH” One of them, Irfan, described his descent down a “dark path” as originating from a teenage quest for internal peace.  The undergraduate, who is studying a creative discipline, was raised in a deeply religious Malay-Muslim family with his mother urging him to pray. But 18-year-old Irfan was young and in love with music and his social life. “I’d go for gigs and festivals, and being in that kind of crowded environment, enjoying music, there’s bound to be things you’re not supposed to do, that’s considered un-Islamic … I wasn’t too proud of myself,” he recalled. He would “engage in vices” such as alcohol - while wrestling with the conflict between wanting to please his parents and have fun at the same time. The solution - the road to redemption, he figured, was to seek more religious knowledge. “So I started searching online and eventually that led me down a spiral, looking through religious videos and watching lots of conspiracy videos, and from then on things just went out of control,” said Irfan, now in his late 20s. Over the years as he delved deeper into tinfoil theories on the likes of 9/11 and Afghanistan, he began distancing himself from his party-going friends, eventually opting to stay home and share his views on social media. “Friends noticed, but no one really reached out or said anything,” he said. “Further down the path, some close friends were concerned, but the more I shared ... the more people saw me as odd.” The trigger was his emotional response to the Syrian situation. “I felt very sad because no one was doing anything,” Irfan said. “In my mind if I went there, I’d figure a way out … I was mentally prepared, and that’s about it. I never really thought it through physically, like in terms of what to bring.” Kenny, similarly, had no specific plans beyond a one-way ticket to Syria: No point of contact, no hotel booked, no currency changed, no nothing. “I just made up my mind and bought a ticket on the same day,” said the 26-year-old, who is furthering his studies in the construction industry. “I didn’t tell anybody, I didn’t pack a lot of clothes, I just left.” All he knew was he wanted to run from his financial problems - five-figure sums he owed to various institutes and individuals alike. It was the same thought he’d kindled for months, since he first randomly came across news of the war in Syria. “I was thinking, since I have so many troubles in Singapore, maybe if I go to Syria to do something great - greater than what I can do here, maybe it’ll make my life more meaningful in a way,” said Kenny, who is a free-thinker. “And anyway my life was miserable - not much different to their lives. I could understand how they feel … People calling me for debts, it’s not easy.” “100 PER CENT CHANGED” Kenny made it as far as the transit area of a “third country” before authorities caught up, put him on a flight back to Singapore and straight into investigations. “I didn’t know what to say to my parents, I couldn’t find a way to explain to them,” he said. While in detention, Kenny grew to appreciate sessions with psychologists who helped work through his problems. “I got to know myself better by telling my stories - like a reflection, I could see myself better, see what went wrong in my life, and know how to do it better next time,” he said MHA said that each detainee will be assessed individually and the rehabilitation approach tailored according to specific needs. Irfan, for instance, said he felt at ease with the religious counsellors assigned to him, as he was able to clarify Islamic concepts with them. “The ustaz (religious teacher) made me see that at this point in time, the world is what it is, and that we as Muslims cannot just declare jihad - we need someone of religious authority, like a mufti … to lead the Muslim community.” A key factor in both his and Kenny’s rehabilitation was their eventual willingness to embrace the people around them - specifically family. “I used to keep everything to myself,” said Kenny, an only child. “Nobody knew about my issues - it was an ego thing, I thought I could solve all the problems by myself. “Now I realise if I talk to parents and relatives, they can help me out … After this incident my parents and I have been closer, our relationship is better.” While Irfan did air his radical views with his family, it only led to him clamming up further. “They were being very Asian parents, just brushing it off and saying ‘don’t watch this kind of thing’,” said the eldest son. “If my parents could see their son was interested in learning, then maybe we could all go to the mosque together to find religious knowledge and that would be better.” Upon his release they had dinner together at home, and Irfan remembers it as a special one. “It felt like we haven’t had that in a while - it’s like they’re not really present when you’re young and trying to share all those things … Then you make a mistake and they start to take notice and reach out to you.” Both Irfan and Kenny also expressed confidence in their ability to reintegrate into society, though the latter admitted to initial concern his identity would affect his job hunt. “I won’t say it was easy, but … I’m on the right track now,” he stated. “I’ll need to do more consideration for my actions in future, in the past I had a lack of planning, lack of everything actually.” Irfan said he was “100 per cent changed” in heart and mind. “I still like to enjoy music, go out, have fun, have a social life - but there must be a balance to it in terms of religious identity,” he stressed. “I accept both sides, it doesn’t mean either/or.” He added that the officers from his detention stint remain “like brothers” to him. “In terms of rehabilitating and going back into society, they’re always reaching out … If I need help, they’d be there.” “I’ve started thinking of bigger ideas like how I want to open a business, do things I always dreamt of as a kid, and create something of a legacy for myself,” Irfan continued. “The setbacks propelled me forward and I’ve become stronger internally. If I can go through this and survive, I can go through anything.” Anyone who is aware of a person becoming involved in terrorism-related activities, including planning or taking steps to travel to conflict zones to take part in an armed conflict, or who observes suspicious activities or signs of radicalisation, should promptly inform the Internal Security Department (1800-2626-ISD) or the Police (999).", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/how-2-singaporeans-got-back-on-right-track-radicalisation-isd-10587728"}, {"datetime": "03 Aug 2018 09:03PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Loong", "Mike Pompeo", "ASEAN"], "author": "", "title": "US, Singapore reaffirm 'excellent' state of bilateral relations", "content": " SINGAPORE: The United States and Singapore have reaffirmed the \"excellent\" state of their bilateral relationship, in a meeting between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Aug 3).  Mr Pompeo, who is in Singapore for the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and related meetings, called on Mr Lee at the Istana.  \"Secretary Pompeo expressed the US’ strong support for Singapore’s chairmanship of ASEAN, and exchanged views on regional and global developments with Prime Minister Lee,\" said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affaits (MFA) in a press statement.  On his part, Mr Lee welcomed the US' continued engagement of ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific region.

There was “great urgency” by the Government to put the facilities that the British would leave behind to economic use and keep tens of thousands of redundant workers to their jobs, he explained.  Keppel Shipyard was thus split off from the Port of Singapore Authority on Aug 3, 1968, as the Singapore Drydocks and Engineering Company before being renamed three weeks later.  That marked the beginning of one of the two anchors in Singapore’s maritime economy, which played a “critical piece” of the Government’s industrialisation plan and lifted the livelihoods of many Singaporeans by creating well-paid jobs, said Mr Lee.  It also helped Singapore to develop its engineering capabilities over the long term, he added.  Over the years, Keppel survived a “notoriously volatile” offshore and marine industry and evolved into the diversified conglomerate it is today.  Apart from the offshore and marine, Keppel’s other core businesses include property, infrastructure and investments. It also has a significant presence in more than 20 countries, with overseas markets accounting for more than half of its total revenue.  Describing Keppel as one of the first Singapore companies to venture abroad with great success, Mr Lee said: “Wherever Keppel’s business takes it in the world, it is seen as a Singapore company and flies the Singapore flag.”  With its roots in Singapore, its far-flung operations are linked back to Singapore and have strengthened the domestic economy. Other Singapore companies have also benefited from Keppel’s expeditions and reputation overseas, while the international exposure has also been valuable for Keppel staff.  With that, Mr Lee said it is “absolutely necessary” for Keppel to go overseas and operate all over the world.  However, it is “equally necessary for Keppel to maintain high standards of integrity and performance, and keep its own operations and culture clean and transparent even when operating in a complicated environment where different norms prevail”, he added. Mr Lee was referring to Keppel Offshore & Marine being slapped with US$422 million (S$567 million) in fines last year as part of a global resolution reached with criminal authorities in the US, Brazil and Singapore over US$55 million corrupt payments made by a former agent in Brazil.  “We may not be able to convert the rest of the world to Singapore norms, but we must uphold Singapore norms and rules in our system wherever our business may take us in the world.”  Another challenge that Keppel has had to face in recent years is getting young Singaporeans to work in the offshore and marine industry.  On that, Mr Lee urged Keppel to redouble its efforts because “a Singaporean core will always be important for Keppel”.  Mr Lee also described the listed company as a “sterling example of a successful government-linked company (GLC) that is run completely on a commercial basis”.  Even though its largest shareholder is Temasek, its operations and investments are not directed by the Government or Temasek, nor does either have a board seat, said Mr Lee.  “The Keppel Board and management are fully responsible for running the company, and they are accountable to all the company’s shareholders. Of course Keppel enjoys strong support from the Government, just like all other Singapore companies big and small.  “This is a unique governance model for government-linked companies in Singapore, and one that has served Singapore, and the companies, well.” NAVIGATING FUTURE CHALLENGES Moving forward, Keppel faces a rapidly-changing world where competition has stiffened, and countries have grown more nationalist and protectionist.  However, Mr Lee said he is confident that Keppel will be able to weather the storm.  “You have a firm foundation of dedicated and competent staff. You have over time established a solid reputation of reliability, which has given you the ability and goodwill to recover from your setbacks and mistakes.  “So as you celebrate your 50th anniversary, I hope that you will remain steadfast to your core values and build on your legacy of excellence so that Keppel and Singapore will continue to shine brightly on the world stage.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-hails-keppel-achievements-on-50th-anniversary-10587382"}, {"datetime": "03 Aug 2018 07:57PM", "tags": ["Wang Yi", "China", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore, China reaffirm long-standing, warm bilateral relations", "content": " SINGAPORE: Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi called on Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Aug 3) and both sides reaffirmed the \"long-standing and warm\" bilateral relations, said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Mr Wang is in Singapore for the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and other related meetings at the Singapore Expo.

The affidavit also said that there has been “no acquisition or disposal of property or assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries”, since the moratorium was granted.  Hyflux has been in search of a buyer for its loss-making Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Plant – the single largest asset on its balance sheet that analysts described as a “noose” around the company’s neck. Last month, the company said it is in touch with eight bidders but it has not received any “real firm offer”. A Bloomberg report on Thursday said Sembcorp Industries, Keppel Corp and Malaysian generator YTL Power International Bhd could be among those interested in acquiring the integrated plant valued at S$1.3 billion.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-sets-aug-3-deadline-for-22-potential-rescue-financiers-to-10586768"}, {"datetime": "03 Aug 2018 03:52PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "cybersecurity", "Smart Nation"], "author": "", "title": "SingHealth cyberattack: Pause lifted on new ICT systems", "content": " SINGAPORE: A pause on new information and communications technology (ICT) systems that was put in place following a cyberattack on SingHealth's system has been lifted, two agencies said on Friday (Aug 3). The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) has completed its review of cybersecurity policies and will implement additional measures for critical government systems to detect threats, it said in a joint statement with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA).

The girl, who is a student, ran away from home in October 2016. While on the run, she and her boyfriend hung out with a group of friends, who introduced the accused, Ruzaini Roslani, to them. That same month, Ruzaini, who is now 21, invited the couple to his home after hanging out with the group. The trio arrived at Ruzaini's home at around 1am and went to his bedroom, where Ruzaini offered a rolled cigarette to the couple. They both took some puffs from the cigarette, and the girl \"observed that the rolled cigarette tasted slightly different from the usual\", court documents said. She did not think much of it at the time, but started to feel dizzy and went to lie down on a bed. Ruzaini then instigated the 18-year-old boy to have sex with his girlfriend. The boy told Ruzaini that he was reluctant to do so, as the victim was only 13, and that he did not know \"how to do it\". Ruzaini then demonstrated to him, by kissing the girl and removing her clothes, repeatedly persuading him to have sex with the victim throughout. \"The accused then began to engage in various penetrative acts with the victim while she was in a state of undress,\" said the prosecutor. The girl's boyfriend followed Ruzaini's instructions and had unprotected sex with the girl. After this, Ruzaini had unprotected sex with the same girl. The two men then helped the girl put on her clothes, and the couple left Ruzaini's house. The girl confided in her friend, and her family members came to know about what had happened. She lodged a police report the following month and later said that it had been her first and only sexual encounter. Ruzaini pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 and one charge of abetting sexual penetration of a minor. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration. District Judge May Mesenas ordered him to undergo reformative training. Offenders aged below 21 can be sentenced to reformative training, which is a more severe punishment than probation. It requires the young offender to be detained in a structured environment for at least 18 months.

Analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting a lower net profit of S$954 million. The growth in the lender’s net profit was supported by higher net interest income and fee income. Net interest margin - which is a key gauge of a bank’s profitability - came in at 1.83 per cent in the second quarter, 8 basis points higher than 1.75 per cent a year earlier. Net interest income grew 14 per cent to S$1.54 billion, supported by the improvement in net interest margin and a 10 per cent increase in loan growth. The bank has declared an interim dividend of S$0.50 per share for the second quarter, higher than the dividend of S$0.35 per share a year ago. “Testament to our focus on generating sustainable growth, our second quarter results are built on the healthy growth momentum in the first quarter,\" said UOB’s deputy chairman and chief executive officer Wee Ee Cheong.  \"Such discipline supports our ability to reward shareholders with an increase in interim dividend per ordinary share to 50 cents.\" With its second quarter numbers, UOB posted record net earnings of S$2.05 billion for the first half of the year, up 24 per cent from a year ago.  However despite the positive results, UOB’s outlook for the rest of the year, like DBS - which announced a 20 per cent jump in net profit for Q2 on Thursday - remains cautious. The bank has cited downside risks like the mounting trade tensions between the US and China which could hurt the Chinese economy, as well as the impact of the recently announced property measures in Singapore - both of which could have significant impact on the lender’s loan growth going forward.  Among peers DBS and OCBC, UOB is the highest exposed to housing loans, with exposure standing at 28 per cent. However, UOB said it remains well-positioned to weather these risks, through its continued investments in technology and its staff, as well as its moves to strengthen connectivity in the region. \"In the face of rising uncertainty globally, our stable asset quality, robust capitalisation and diversified funding base put us in a strong position to drive future growth,\" said Mr Wee.  \"We will remain vigilant, nimble and continue to invest in capabilities to serve our customers’ evolving needs.\" He added: \"As a long-term player, we remain steadfast in augmenting our regional footprint to extend our reach to a wider group of customers and to tap the region’s connectivity potential.\" Mr Wee also told reporters at a briefing that the bank does not expect housing loans growth to fall in the short term, given the “progressive drawdown of loans booked previously”. He added that UOB has maintained its housing loans growth forecast at 6 to 7 per cent, though housing loan activities could see some impact. “Looking at some of the housing loan activities, I would expect a drop of 10 to 20 per cent in housing loan applications (for the second half of this year). Prices could fall 5 to 10 per cent in time,” he said. “We maintain our market share of new sales in Singapore despite competition in the financing market. However, in the next few months, we expect transaction volume to decline in response to recent cooling measures.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/uob-q2-net-profit-rises-beats-estimates-bank-results-10585148"}, {"datetime": "03 Aug 2018 06:19AM", "tags": ["Team Singapore", "Asian Games", "Grace Fu", "sports"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Commentary: Is having 'no specific target' tantamount to 'no vision' for Singapore sports?", "content": " SINGAPORE: When Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu recently said that there is “no specific” target for Team Singapore athletes who will be competing at the 2018 Asian Games, netizens responded with a mixture of confusion and derision. Does the absence of a target signify a lack of aspirations, expectations and vision? Some speculated that the authorities were too afraid to set targets for fear of falling short. Whatever the actual reasons, a case can be made for not announcing targets  considering the way the public has responded over the years. A case in point is former national swimmer, Joscelin Yeo’s experience. Ms Yeo won 40 gold medals at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in her 17-year competitive swimming career. She is the only athlete on record to have won that many SEA Games gold medals. She also represented Singapore in the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and four Olympic Games. While she progressively gained much deserved public adulation for her medal wins, she acknowledged that the public reaction to her international debut was hard to handle. THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT OF NOT MEETING EXPECTATIONS In an On the Record interview last year, she described what happened at the SEA Games in 1991 in Manila where she won two silver and three bronze medals. Instead of being celebrated for these wins, Ms Yeo found herself being condemned. \"I was 12 and I was swimming at my first SEA Games. But because I was representing the national team, the expectation was that you come home with gold medals. I got a bad report in the media. I knew I was not living up to public expectations,” she said. It was clear that even though more than 20 years had passed since the Games, the memory of falling short still affected her on a visceral level. She actually quit swimming for a few months after the negative coverage. Athletes I have spoken with over the years tell me that they all have personal goals and targets, but expressing them to the public sometimes has a detrimental effect. It increases pressure, raises expectations and if publicly-expressed goals are not met, widespread criticism of not only the athletes but government agencies involved in sports administration only serves to further harm morale. This could indeed be one of the reasons for not announcing targets. SETTING MEANINGFUL AND REALISTIC GOALS Setting unrealistic goals is clearly detrimental too. An example that many Singaporeans remember is one articulated in 1998 by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of aiming to qualify for the World Cup by 2010. He had spoken about achieving this partly by naturalising foreign talent to help boost the local football scene. Even then, many questioned if Goal 2010 was achievable. Today, it’s clear that it wasn’t. However, having a meaningful vision that inspires athletes and Singaporeans as a whole remains key.   And when realistic targets are set, they can have the effect of inspiring initiatives that propel us towards excellence. But even if these targets are not immediately met, we need to be able to soldier on and support the journey. Are we capable of that? THE MEANING OF SPORTS AND THE ROLE OF THE “VILLAGE” Several issues plague sports in Singapore today. Debate over whether the state is doing enough to fund our athletes and whether corporates are sufficiently stepping up, rears its head every now and then. Recently, the Ben Davis saga surfaced the issue of National Service obligations possibly getting in the way of sporting excellence. The fact that such issues still generate public debate shows that Singaporeans see some meaning in sports. But do we see enough meaning in it to have and pursue our sporting dreams and to encourage those around us to do so? Do we see enough meaning in it to support our athletes proudly and unconditionally? Are most of us merely fair-weather fans? The public adulation that national swimmer, Joseph Schooling garnered as a result of his Olympic gold medal win in 2016 was expected. But would the public have commended him had he merely won a bronze medal or none at all in spite of doing his best? Any athlete would tell you that consistent fan support can inspire excellence too. CEO of Sport Singapore (SportSG), Lim Teck Yin said in another On the Record interview that the role of the “village” which includes corporations and individuals, is vital. He said: The meaningfulness of the achievement of our national athletes will be enhanced only when the village gets behind them in substantive ways. When there’s an over-reliance on one party (the Government) to do everything, the value of bringing people together is lost. We need to build something great together. A STRONG VISION  Whether we are able to get behind a sporting vision for Singapore is dependent on several factors. The Government and other sports bodies clearly have a role to play in defining a vision, especially in a country where sporting excellence has often played a secondary role to academic excellence. To be fair, cultivating a sporting nation has been on the national agenda for several decades and efforts have been made in this regard. For instance, SportSG’s Vision 2030 is meant to inspire mass participation and support for those representing Singapore on the international stage. On SportSG’s web site, it is described as “the story of our people and how Sports can be used as a strategy to achieve our national priorities such as developing healthy and resilient people, forging strong united communities, retention of core values, shared memories, strengthened friendships as well as building a dynamic society and economy.” This is supported by initiatives such as the Sports Facilities Master Plan “to provide greater access to quality, affordable sports facilities and enable wider participation in sports”. SportSG says initiatives to encourage sports participation through ActiveSG have had a positive impact. Hopefully, all this will inspire more to work towards excelling at the elite level as well. Whether sports can be a viable career in Singapore is another issue that has to be progressively addressed. However, these issues perhaps can only be addressed if, as a start, more of us took action on the ground to doggedly pursue our sporting dreams or to encourage others to do so. The authorities can formulate a vision and do more to put in place mechanisms to support it, but ultimately it comes down to the people. Do we dare encourage and rally round those who represent our nation at the highest levels regardless of their results in order to inspire them to greater heights and create a vibrant sporting culture? It’s time to ask ourselves if our brand of Singaporean pragmatism of setting KPIs and responding positively only when these are achieved can be elevated to unconditional support that inspires excellence without fear of condemnation.  Bharati Jagdish is the host of Channel NewsAsia Digital News' hard-hitting On The Record, a weekly interview with thought leaders across Singapore, and The Pulse, Channel NewsAsia’s weekly podcast that discusses the hottest issues of the week.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/sports-singapore-no-target-grace-fu-mccy-sporting-nation-10582396"}, {"datetime": "03 Aug 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["elderly", "community", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "8 seniors on a social media mission to build a S$15 million home", "content": " SINGAPORE: Asked if she knew what a selfie was, 74-year-old Lim Siew Ngo peered over the top of her glasses, looking puzzled. “What’s selfless?” she said. As for FOMO – millennial lingo for fear of missing out – she confidently declared that it stood for “father out, mother out”, much to the amusement of SGAG creative manager Chua Yuxuan. Expecting a bunch of elderly tech noobs like her to spearhead a crowdfunding exercise by creating a social video on smartphones was never going to be easy. But eight residents, aged between 66 and 90, from St John’s Home for Elderly Persons recently rose to the challenge, with their home’s future at stake. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n They were presented with the opportunity to enter the unfamiliar realm of social media in the series #DontForgetMe, featuring elderly Singaporeans left out of the ultra-connected digital world. And with Channel NewsAsia’s help, two talents from local humour website SGAG were roped in to mentor these residents in their digital learning and fundraising efforts. (Watch the episode here.) “We chose (the residents) because they’d be able to work together as a team, helping each other when they come together to learn,” said the home’s general manager Goh Beng Hoe. Some, like 71-year-old Lim Seng Kim, simply wanted to show gratitude to the home, where most of the seniors are on public assistance. “People who live here come from places of hardship; they don’t get much support. It’s like they have nowhere left to go. That’s why they’re living here,” he said. “I’ll use the last years of my life to save this home.” NEW BUILDING NEEDED Three years ago, the home at Wan Tho Avenue bought a fresh 30-year lease for 3,300 square metres of the state-owned land, about a quarter of the area under the old lease. To house its residents in that smaller area, a new five-storey facility, which will nearly double its licensed capacity to 150 residents, is due to be built and completed by end-2020. The building cost will be more than S$15 million, and the home is still short of S$5 million, which it must raise by 2020. “We’re already at the stage where we’ll award the project, but we need to work doubly hard now. The last S$5 million will be difficult to raise; we’ve already reached out to many donors,” said Mr Goh, adding that the home would like to avoid taking a loan. The home usually raises about S$6,000 to S$7,000 a month via crowdfunding – an insufficient amount to hit its target by 2020. “Never in our entire history of the home have we needed to raise such a big sum,” said Mr Goh. The most difficult thing is that people don’t know us. We’ve been keeping a very low profile. Would the seniors be able to help through a social video? About four months ago, they started learning the basics of smartphone usage (with phones sponsored by Sony Mobile), and for some like Mdm Lim, even finding the power button proved to be a challenge. “How to press? I don’t know how to press,” she asked, scowling in frustration, while the oldest in the group, 90-year-old Anandam Tanjamal, struggled to get the touch screen to respond. Said Mdm Anandam: “It keeps going to the wrong screen.” ANY FACEBOOK FRIENDS? It was when they were setting up their Facebook accounts, however, that this social experiment highlighted a bigger concern than the difficulty of learning to use smartphones: The seniors’ social disconnection. When SGAG’s Mr Chua asked 66-year-old Ng Ann Lock if he had friends outside St. John’s whom he wanted to add on Facebook, Mr Ng hesitated and mumbled: “Friend? Errr.” He thought hard and furnished a name, who turned out to be a former employee at the home. For Mr Henry Chong, 81, who added his BFF (best friend forever), fellow resident Arvindnath Sharma, 75, there was only one other Facebook “friend” to add: A news site. When the widower, who was rescued by the home after he lost his housing in a financial mishap, was asked why he did not add more friends, he replied matter-of-factly: “I don’t like because too many friends, too many troubles.” Mdm Anandam, on the other hand, could connect with her family on Facebook. It has been seven years since she moved voluntarily to this home, so as not to burden her family with her poor health. She sees her family weekly, but now hopes for more regular updates on them. She has already learnt the art of “Facebook stalking” – a way for her to make sure her family are doing well, through her grandson’s Facebook page. SIMPLE BUT HEART-WARMING VIDEO For their fundraising appeal, the seniors were also introduced to the selfie video, the concept Mr Arvindnath decided on after the group voted for him, with his can-do spirit and familiarity with using a smartphone, to be the director. “I never thought I’d have the chance to make a movie,” Mr Arvindnath said proudly after he interviewed them on why they loved the home. The result was a simple, raw but heart-warming piece shot within the home’s compound, in which the residents described how their general manager was having difficulty raising enough funds. Individually and in pairs, they appealed for donations and talked about what they do in the home and why they like it. “The raising of the funds isn’t about our effort itself – it’s all of us (being) included. So it’s teamwork that counts,” said Mr Arvindnath. Before the video was uploaded onto social media at end-May, Mr Goh said: “They really put in a lot of effort. Most of them aren't digital savvy. I hope we’ll do well.” Within a week, the video raised some S$10,700. As of end-July, more than S$67,000 was raised – five times the donation rate before the video. “This must be a dream,” laughed Mdm Lim after the first week, to which a positive Mr Arvindnath said in reply: “Nothing is impossible.” Making this fundraising video has empowered the seniors, besides introducing them to social media. For example, Mr Lim the grateful resident now finds the smartphone useful for photographing the final memories of the old compound. BFFs Mr Arvindnath and Mr Chong even plan to make their own funny videos. “Seniors from these homes can learn if they take the opportunity to learn. But the reason they don’t learn is because they feel embarrassed,” said Mr Arvindnath. “They fail to understand that … you’re never too old to learn.” Watch the episode here.

These were laid out in a wide-ranging joint statement that also included a sign of progress for negotiations on a code of conduct in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.   The 26-page joint communique was issued at the end of a series of meetings at the Singapore Expo, where officials from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also met with key partners from the region, such as Japan and China.  Speaking at a press conference, Singapore’s Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan described the wide variety of topics discussed as the grouping’s responses to “tectonic shifts” that have rendered ASEAN at an “inflexion point”. “We are facing challenges because the world as we know it for the past 70 years has changed,” he said, citing the emergence of a multi-polar world, brewing trade wars and disruptive shifts caused by a \"digital revolution\". Despite that, ASEAN has to remain relevant and improve the lives of its people, he said.  For one, ASEAN member states reaffirmed their commitment to deeper economic integration through various ASEAN-led initiatives, as well as the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).  “We reiterated the priority placed by ASEAN on the RCEP as a centrepiece of its external economic relations, particularly at a time of growing uncertainty in global trade,” the joint communique said.  The ministers also agreed to “fully tap the opportunities afforded by new technologies and innovation arising from the digital revolution”, though they stressed the need to stay responsive to emerging issues, such as non-traditional security threats and environmental challenges.  A “major achievement” also came in the form of an agreement with China on a single draft for future negotiations on the code of conduct in the South China Sea, said Dr Balakrishnan.  However, he told reporters that the draft document does not mean that negotiations are over, or that all the competing claims over territory in the South China Sea are resolved. He also said it would be premature to set a deadline for the negotiations.  At the press conference, Dr Balakrishnan was also asked about a media report on a potential cybersecurity agreement between ASEAN and Russia.  To that, he would only say that the regional grouping is not looking for any “exclusive arrangements” and that it is open to cooperation with “as many partners as possible in order to secure (the region’s) networks (and) maximize opportunities in this digital revolution”.  The minister added that while the digital revolution brings with it opportunities, the issue of cybersecurity needs to be addressed before the benefits of the digital revolution can be reliably harvested.  “Cybersecurity is a concern for all of us. We will work with all partners who are willing to engage us, share technology, best practices and failures so that we don’t repeat mistakes.”  When summarising the joint communique, Dr Balakrishnan described the annual meeting among ASEAN foreign ministers as a “good session\" and quipped that “one index of that is we are able to issue the communique well ahead of time”.  Still, he noted that the negotiating process is never easy with the involvement of 10 diverse countries.  “Getting everyone to agree on a (joint communique) is never a trivial exercise,” he said. “But our senior officials have worked very hard … and arrived at a statement which we believe accurately reflects the consensus position of all 10 ASEAN countries.  Last year, the release of the customary communique at the end of the meetings was delayed with reports suggesting that there was a lack of consensus on how to refer to disputes in the South China Sea.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/asean-foreign-ministers-deeper-integration-south-china-sea-talks-10584160"}, {"datetime": "02 Aug 2018 09:11PM", "tags": ["oBike", "liquidation", "FTI Consulting"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "S$10 million of oBike Singapore users’ money transferred to Hong Kong", "content": " SINGAPORE: Out of the S$12 million collected from oBike Singapore users, S$10 million was transferred to its Hong Kong office before the company shut down in June, its liquidators said on Thursday (Aug 2). FTI Consulting, the liquidator, said the S$10 million was netted off against a loan of S$11 million from oBike Hong Kong to its Singapore office.  “Some of the transactions are inappropriate given the financial position of the company, and we will be looking at those a lot further,” FTI Consulting’s senior managing director Joshua Taylor said. “We can look at unwinding that transaction to say ‘no, you do owe the money to oBike Singapore and you need to pay the money to oBike Singapore’, that's what we have communicated,” he added. Mr Taylor said oBike Singapore users have filed “hundreds of thousands of dollars” worth of claims and that its Hong Kong office had proposed to pay for this. But FTI Consulting rejected it, as the amount falls short of the S$8.9 million in total that it owed its Singapore users.  “What it does not take into consideration is all the money of deposit holders who have not filed,” Mr Taylor said.  He was speaking to reporters at Shaw Tower after FTI Consulting had a three-hour meeting with the bike-sharing firm's Singapore creditors. The liquidators will be issuing letters of demand to oBike founder Shi Yi, asking for the monies to be returned, Mr Taylor said. “Even though he was not a director on record, my understanding is that he did have a lot of control over the Singapore operations,” he said. “We have told Shi Yi that there has to be a process followed and he should refund the monies, and ensure everyone has an opportunity to file their claim,” he added.  oBike users who attended the meeting on Thursday were asked to vote on whether they wanted FTI Consulting to continue representing them. Almost all of the 29 people who voted wanted the liquidators to continue. \"The most important thing is to get the creditors’ money back. That's what our role is and that's what we'll be doing,\" Mr Taylor said. OBIKE USERS LEFT DISAPPOINTED  “This was a wasted trip, and I had to pay ERP to get here,” said driver Patrick Ler. He had hoped to get a refund at the meeting, he said.  He said he had tried to fill in a form for a claim online, but he only got through halfway before he stopped, as he had to fill in too many details, including proof that he paid a deposit of S$49.  Freelance salesperson Patrick Tan, who was unable to enter the 3pm meeting because he arrived late, said he had tried to apply for a refund for his deposit even before news of oBike Singapore shutting down broke.  He used oBike only once, and was hoping to be able to get a refund. He similarly had a gripe with the claims form.  “We even have to trace bank records from a year back. It’s tedious,” he said.  Those who attended were given an email address they could write to instead of filling up the form.  Housewife Karin Goh, 59, said she left the auditorium where the meeting was being held once she found out the purpose of the meeting was a vote.  “I don't care who represents us as long as I get back my deposit,” she said. While she did not think she would be able to get the S$98 in deposits she and her daughter paid, she thought she would get more information on the refund process.  She said, however, that she will not be putting in too much effort to get the money.  “If I can get, I get, it doesn't make me a bankrupt, it doesn't make me a millionaire,” she said. FTI Consulting said that it will keep creditors updated in the interim.

Leung Shun Kit, who was a Grab driver at the time, first robbed a man who owed his alleged accomplice a debt in March last year at Geylang. They robbed the victim of S$4,330 worth of items and cash, helped by one other man. The victim was left bleeding from his nose and was bruised on his face. A few months later in August last year, Leung was arrested with two other men and three women by a party of officers from the Street Walker Task Force of the Criminal Investigation Department. Several condoms were found in Leung's car, and investigations revealed that he was managing the prostitution activities of the three women - Thai nationals aged between 21 and 22. Investigations found that Leung had started out by working as a runner and driver for another man, Lim Keng Hee. Leung would approach men in Geylang to ask if they wanted to have sex with a Thai woman. He would then ferry interested customers and their selected woman to a hotel, earning S$10 per trip. However, Lim was convicted of drug-related offences in July 2017, and Leung started managing his own girls, as he had obtained the contacts of a few of them while working for Lim. He also had the contact of an agent in Thailand who provided Thai women who came to Singapore to work as prostitutes. Leung's other related offences include receiving a prostitute, living off a prostitute's earnings and procuring a prostitute from Thailand. HE JOINED IN TO PUNCH A MAN IN GEYLANG In October last year, Leung punched a 29-year-old Indian national in Geylang, with five other pimps. One of the pimps had approached the victim, asking if he wished to engage the services of a prostitute. The victim declined and the pair got into an argument. The victim hurled vulgarities at the pimp and tried to run away, but was detained by other pimps, who began punching his face and body. The commotion drew Leung's attention, who joined the group and punched the victim in the face.  The victim managed to break free and fled, seeking the assistance of police officers when he saw a police car passing by. HE TRIED TO START FIRE AT A PETROL KIOSK The offences did not stop there. In February this year, Leung drove a rental car to the Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC) Tampines petrol station at about 2am. He asked a pump attendant there to pump S$30 worth of petrol into his car. The pump attendant repeated Leung's order for confirmation, and Leung said he wished to have S$33.33 worth of petrol instead, having factored in his entitlement to a 10 per cent discount at the petrol station. As the pump attendant tried to clarify the amount of petrol Leung wanted, Leung grew agitated and they started arguing. The pump attendant then retreated into the convenience store and waited in the storeroom, while Leung retrieved an aerosol can and a lighter from his car. He lit the lighter and sprayed the air freshener from the can over the open flame of the lighter at the petrol kiosk. The air freshener did not catch fire and no damage was caused to the petrol station. Leung then paid for his petrol and left the station, while an SPC employee made a police report later that day. Leung was sentenced to six strokes of the cane and a jail term of three years and 20 months on Thursday. He was given a fine of S$18,000, which he will have to serve eight weeks in jail for if he cannot pay the amount.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pimp-who-robbed-man-tried-to-start-petrol-station-fire-gets-jail-10583638"}, {"datetime": "02 Aug 2018 06:32PM", "tags": ["crime", "Orchard Towers"], "author": "", "title": "Man arrested for allegedly having sex outside Orchard Towers", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 30-year-old man who allegedly had sex with a woman outside Orchard Towers in July has been arrested, said the police on Thursday (Aug 2).  Videos of the incident have been circulating online.

This was announced by Singapore’s Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Thursday (Aug 2) at the start of an annual ministerial meeting between China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  Besides being the ASEAN chair this year, Singapore is the country coordinator of ASEAN-China dialogue relations. China has overlapping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea with several ASEAN members, including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Negotiations on the code of conduct began in March, and both sides arrived at the first draft during talks held two months ago at China’s Changsha city, said Dr Balakrishnan. Calling it “yet another milestone”, the minister said the single draft negotiating text will be a “living document and the basis of future code of conduct negotiations”. Both sides also agreed on the key modalities for future rounds of negotiations.  When asked what these key modalities were, Dr Balakrishnan, who held a press conference after the ministerial meeting, declined to reveal details citing the “sensitive nature” of the negotiations.  He also said that the agreement on a single text does not mean that negotiations are over, or that all the competing claims over territory in the South China Sea are resolved as the code of conduct “was never meant to resolve territorial disputes”.  Dr Balakrishnan added that it would be premature to set a deadline for the negotiations on the code of conduct as it involves a \"dynamic, evolving situation\". “Right now, everyone is glad that we have reached this stage. Everyone hopes that we will be able to accelerate the process but I’m not in the position to set specific deadlines,\" he said, while adding that it is better to \"maintain some flexibility so that nobody feels locked in\" for such negotiations. POSITIVE ASEAN-CHINA COOPERATION Dr Balakrishnan, who is the co-chair of Thursday’s meeting, said ASEAN-China cooperation has “had a good run” over the past three years. Relations have been underpinned by robust economic linkages, he said. China has been ASEAN’s top trading partner for eight consecutive years, while the regional grouping’s free trade agreement (FTA) with China was upgraded in 2015.  Both sides have a joint target of US$1 trillion in trade and US$150 billion in investment by 2020. ASEAN and China have also renewed their commitment to expedite negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), as part of efforts to promote economic integration and trade liberalisation. There was also close cooperation in other areas, including anti-corruption, connectivity, education, human resource development, science and technology. However, Dr Balakrishnan said such “strong and substantive cooperation is only possible with mutual trust and confidence”. “Where there are disagreements from time to time, the key is to seek out common ground, focus on practical cooperation and resolve differences peacefully and in the spirit of goodwill,” he said. These include efforts by the ASEAN member states and China to work towards a full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) in the South China Sea, as well as an early conclusion of an effective code of conduct. The DOC was inked in 2002, calling for disputes to be managed by peaceful means and in accordance with international law, but ASEAN and China have been seeking to make progress on that declaration with a code of conduct.  In 2016, both sides also adopted a code for unplanned encounters in the South China Sea, followed by the operationalisation of an emergency hotline for maritime emergencies in the vital waterway in 2017. “China is one of ASEAN’s most substantive dialogue partners,” said Dr Balakrishnan. “All in all, ASEAN-China cooperation has enjoyed a very good run over the last three years but there is much more to be done.” For instance, officials on Thursday will endorse a statement for a vision that outlines the broad and strategic overview of cooperation between ASEAN and China until 2030. “We look forward to the leaders adopting this statement at the 21st ASEAN-China Summit in November 2018,” the minister said.

He was also ordered to pay a penalty of more than S$92,000, three times the amount of tax undercharged, to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). Sng Kay Heng, the accomplice of mastermind Eric Chia Puay Yeoh's complex GST scam using multiple shell entities, was handed the sentence more than a decade after investigations first began in 2007. Chia, who had three accomplices and defrauded the Government of almost S$1 million, was jailed for 15 months in 2014 and ordered to pay a penalty of more than S$1.2 million. Sng, the sole proprietor of general wholesale trade firm Strikey Trading, made false entries in GST returns for his company on three occasions in late 2005 and early 2006, resulting in the undercharging of tax by a total of S$30,806.61. He had help from Chia in falsifying documents to make fraudulent claims in his GST returns for his business. Chia altered purchase and sale invoices originally issued to another company to reflect the name of Strikey Trading. Investigations revealed that the suppliers reflected in the invoices did not make any sales to the company.  PROSECUTION ASKED FOR 14 WEEKS' JAIL IRAS senior tax prosecutor Patrick Nai asked for Sng to be jailed for at least 14 weeks, saying that there was significant public interest in ensuring that those who deliberately evade tax are dealt with severely. \"If not for the IRAS investigation officers' efforts to uncover the offence, the accused would have cheated the tax authorities, a government institution, of S$30,806.61,\" he said. He added that Sng was \"often quick to push the blame to his accomplice Chia\" throughout the trial and \"did not show any remorse\". However, Sng's lawyer asked for a one day jail sentence, saying that his client had cooperated with IRAS and the authorities by attending all interviews from 2007.

His comments come in the wake of local reports citing a spike in HFMD cases in Johor.  The southern Malaysian state recorded a total of 2,215 HFMD cases from Jan 1 until Jul 21 this year, up 37 per cent from the 1,607 cases recorded within the same period last year. The increasing trend of HFMD cases was recorded across all Malaysian states, prompting the health ministry to issue a warning in June.  Last Monday, Malaysia confirmed its first fatality from HFMD after a 17-month-old boy died in Penang. Dr Sahruddin, who is a trained medical doctor, told Channel NewsAsia that so far this year, 39 schools have been shut after at least two or three of their students contracted HFMD.  However he stressed that they would typically re-open after a couple of days of disinfection. Dr Sahruddin also advised Singaporean families who cross the Causeway to bring along a hand sanitiser and “use it often”.  “Get the children to use it as many times as possible,\" said the state assemblyman for Bukit Kepong.  \"Children touch things all the time - supermarket trolleys, food court tables, toys - so we must ensure they keep themselves sanitised.” Dr Sahruddin added that if the children return home to Singapore and catch a fever, it “is important” that they see a doctor for further treatment. Responding to a question about further preventive action if the increasing trend of HFMD cases in Johor continues, Dr Sahruddin said his office regularly sends HFMD reports to the health ministry before awaiting further instructions from the federal government. “For now, it’s not necessary to take temperatures of children at the Causeway,\" he said.  \"For the time being, we want to mitigate the spread of the virus, and educate families on how to prevent it.\" HFMD is a viral infection which can affect both adults and children, though young children below the age of five are more susceptible, according to Singapore's Ministry of Health.  It is spread from person to person by direct contact with nasal discharge, saliva, faeces, and fluids from the rash of an infected person.  It can also spread through contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/singapore-johor-hfmd-causeway-sahruddin-jamal-malaysia-10582796"}, {"datetime": "02 Aug 2018 12:07PM", "tags": ["Google", "technology", "business", "jobs"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Google's job hunting service launches in Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: For those seeking new career opportunities, another job search tool is now available at your disposal: Google's new job search feature in Singapore.

Jet fuel prices have surged almost 40 per cent year-on-year and are now close to US$90 (S$123) per barrel on average, Scoot said. The International Air Transport Association in June forecast average passenger yields, a proxy for air fares, would rise by 3.2 per cent this year, in the first annual gain since 2011 but lowered its annual profit estimate due to the rising cost of fuel and labour. Air New Zealand in May announced a 5 per cent increase in domestic fares due to rising costs, while regulators in Japan and Taiwan have allowed airlines to put in place fuel surcharges to help compensate for the higher oil price. Singapore Airlines last week reported a 3.2 per cent decline in passenger yields for the quarter ended Jun 30, including a 1.8 per cent fall at Scoot, disappointing investors who had hoped for fare increases. Scoot on Thursday said it would look to cut costs in addition to raising fares, by exploring ways to reduce fuel burn, reviewing supplier contracts, using measures to increase productivity and keeping manpower resources lean. The airline said fuel comprised an average of 32 per cent of its operating costs and its fuel costs had risen by 31 per cent compared to a year earlier. Scoot reported a S$1 million profit in the June quarter, down from S$3 million a year earlier.

Three Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) centres in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos will be upgraded to Singapore Cooperation Centres, which will have an expanded range of technical assistance and new modalities for capacity building. \"Singapore hopes to share our experiences and at the same time, learn from our neighbours and partners,” said Mr Lee during the opening ceremony of the 51st ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (AMM) and related meetings. Singapore is the ASEAN chair this year. In his speech, Mr Lee stressed the need to continue strengthening regional architecture even as various ASEAN-led structures, such as the ASEAN Economic Community, have served the region well. This comes amid growing geopolitical uncertainties and how each ASEAN member state is subject to “different pulls and pressures from bigger powers”. Staying united, as well as maintaining ASEAN’s cohesion and effectiveness, will be “the only way” for the grouping to “remain relevant and be of value”, Mr Lee added. ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND TECHNOLOGY He highlighted two areas where the region can do more, namely economic integration and technology adoption.  On the former, Mr Lee said it is “important” for ASEAN to continue its support for the rules-based multilateral trading system, even as this has come under pressure of late due to escalating trade tensions between US and major economies, such as China and the European Union (EU).  At the moment, ASEAN countries continue to work towards the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) by the end of the year, and is working with the EU on a Comprehensive Air Transport Arrangement (CATA).  The latter will be the first substantive aviation arrangement between the two regional groupings.  “When established, the RCEP and ASEAN-EU CATA will send a clear signal of ASEAN’s commitment to trade liberalisation and economic integration,” said Mr Lee, even though he added that he does not expect negotiations to be easy given the growing mood of nationalism and protectionism.  Technology and innovation will also have to be embraced, so as to build up ASEAN’s digital connectivity and make itself ready for the future.  For one, the 26 participating cities of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network have held the inaugural meeting last month.  “Singapore hopes that these cities will come together to establish a common framework for smart city development and to develop city-specific action plans and innovative projects that will improve the lives of our peoples,” said Mr Lee. Meanwhile, Singapore has launched its own efforts to support the drive towards digitalisation – in the form of a Smart Nation initiative – while stepping up cybersecurity defences, especially in 11 critical sectors including healthcare and water supply.  This latter has acquired even more urgency on the back of a major intrusion into SingHealth’s database, in which personal information of 1.5 million people were stolen by hackers, he added. Officials from ASEAN countries and their key counterparts from the region are in Singapore this week for the annual AMM and related meetings, which started on Monday.  Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who will chair the AMM, also addressed the audience at the opening ceremony.  He said that ASEAN is at an \"inflexion point\" given changes in the security and economic landscape.  \"We are transiting into a multipolar world. We are all acutely aware of the storm clouds of the trade war and we can also see and feel the disruption that digital revolution is causing all around us.\"  Hence, it is vital for the regional grouping to remain anchored on its principles of unity and centrality, maintain an open rules-based regional architecture while remaining a testament to benefits of free trade and economic integration, the minister said. ASEAN will also have to keep collaborating with external partners, Dr Balakrishnan added.  On the agenda over the next few days of meetings, the East Asia Summit will negotiate a range of statements on topics, such as cybersecurity, smart cities and counter-terrorism. Singapore is also planning to host a cybersecurity-related ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) workshop later this year, he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-asean-pm-lee-technology-economic-integration-10582280"}, {"datetime": "02 Aug 2018 08:32AM", "tags": ["DBS", "business", "finance"], "author": "", "title": "DBS Q2 profit rises 20%, misses market estimates", "content": " SINGAPORE: DBS Group Holdings Ltd, Southeast Asia's biggest lender, reported a 20 per cent jump in net profit on Thursday (Aug 2), missing market expectations as the impact of business volume growth was moderated by lower trading income. DBS's profit increase was also supported by improved net interest income and fee income. The net interest income, which refers to interest it earns from loans, rose 18 per cent to S$2.2 billion, with loans growing 12 per cent. Singaporean banks reported record profits last year but the outlook for the sector has been clouded by curbs on property investment imposed last month and a slowdown in economic growth due to international trade tensions, analysts said. DBS's net profit came in at S$1.37 billion in the three months ending June versus S$1.14 billion a year earlier, and an average estimate of S$1.47 billion from three analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. DBS's net interest margin, which is the difference banks make from the interest it earns through giving out loans and the interest it pays out to customer deposits, and also a key gauge of profitability, increased 11 basis points to 1.85 per cent from 1.74 per cent a year earlier.  DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said in a statement on Thursday that he expects a 1 to 2 basis points increase in net interest margin for the full year, on the back of two expected rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Despite the positive second-quarter results, DBS’s outlook remains cautious as it moves into the second half of the year, largely thanks to “heightened macroeconomic uncertainty”. “Amidst heightened uncertainty and market volatility, business momentum was sustained in the second quarter. While there are gathering clouds, the region’s prospects remain intact, enabling us to continue capturing growth opportunities and generating stronger shareholder returns in the coming quarters,” he said. These uncertainties include the mounting trade tensions between US and China which could potentially disrupt global trade flows and supply chains. It has led the bank to reduce its loan growth outlook from 8 per cent to between 6 and 7 per cent. Another downside to loan growth in the second half of the year includes the impact of the recently announced property cooling measures, but analysts say they do not expect DBS to hit as significantly as its peers United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC). That is because among the trio, DBS is the least exposed to housing loans while UOB has the largest exposure to housing loans at 28 per cent. SLOWDOWN EXPECTED IN CONSUMER MORTGAGE BOOK However Mr Gupta told reporters that the bank expects a slowdown in its consumer mortgage book. \"Given what happened with the last set of property cooling measures, I anticipate we’d probably give up about S$500 million worth of new loan bookings in the second half of this year, so loan bookings will come in at S$3.5 billion instead of S$4 billion initially anticipated,” he said during the lender's results briefing. He added that the “biggest problem” with trade tensions between the US and China was the spillover effect that stems from the spat. “It’s really a confidence issue, it’s a market psychology issue rather than what happens to the underlying trade flow,\" he said. \"That starts impacting what happens to the equity market, the yield curve and credit spreads in the region. \"And for us, therefore it’s not the fundamental core business that gets impacted but it is the treasury market business that will see some impact.” The latest quarter's net profit was 10 per cent below the first-quarter's record due to the weaker trading performance and the absence of a property disposal gain, the bank said. On the dividends front, the bank has declared its first-half dividends at S$0.60 per share, up from S$0.33 per share a year earlier. The bank, about 29 per cent-owned by Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings, kicks off the quarterly results reporting season for lenders in the regional financial hub.

In an interview with Channel NewsAsia on Tuesday (Jul 31), Mr Lee said it has been hard work to get the electronic payment system provider to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive marketplace, where it was once the market leader together with NETS. EZ-Link, set up in April 2002 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), was not able to press home its market advantage. Today, a whole host of competitors, ranging from tech giants like Apple, Google, Alibaba and Tencent on the mobile payments end of the spectrum to service providers like Grab and Carousell with their own digital wallets, generate the buzz in the e-payments space. Banks like DBS, OCBC and UOB also offer their own products. LIMITED BY LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE  It’s not something that has gone unnoticed by the company. Mr Lee said, candidly, that its efforts to modernise its offerings – including the ability to top up an EZ-Link card using its mobile app – has been somewhat limited by an infrastructure developed more than a decade ago. For instance, the Contactless e-Purse Application, more commonly known today as CEPAS, was introduced as a standard for e-payments by the-then SPRING Singapore in January 2006 and EZ-Link was the first company to adopt and sell CEPAS-compliant cards in 2008. However, the CEO pointed out that CEPAS was developed as an offline stored value wallet, and the dollar value stored is linked to the SIM embedded in the card. This means it’s not possible to offer the convenience and ease of use provided by other rival mobile payment options from Apple and Google, and more recently, NETS.   Instead, what it has today is giving consumers the ability to top up their EZ-Link cards via its EZ-Link mobile app. And it is keen to highlight efforts to make the user experience appealing for commuters. Mr Lee said the activation of one's EZ-Link account on the app has been shortened and, for Android smartphone users, they can top up their cards with their mobile devices and without having to visit a general ticketing machine.   “It’s not ideal (to still need the physical card for top ups), but we work with what we’ve got,” Mr Lee said. System limitations aside, external factors are also making its efforts to remain relevant a challenge. For instance, LTA's account-based ticketing pilot which took off with Mastercard as partner in July 2016, would appear to make the need for EZ-Link cards for transport increasingly unnecessary. The initiative allowed Mastercard holders to tap their contactless credit and debit cards to pay for train and bus journeys and track their fares via an app or portal. Visa and NETS came on onboard in June this year after “encouraging” pilot results. LTA has also trialed the use of mobile payment - specifically Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay - with a select group of Mastercard users since March this year. When asked if account-based ticketing will make EZ-Link cards redundant for commuters, Mr Lee maintained that it does not. “We will still have space to play in,” he elaborated. “There will always be people who aren’t comfortable having credit cards as well as those holding concession cards. “There will always be a need.” “WE ARE NOT HERE TO COMPETE” The company, he said, has been embarking on a digital push, in terms of making things more seamless and quicker. These include tying up with NTUC and its LinkPoints rewards programme, as well as mobile virtual network operator Circles.Life. It has also introduced EZ-Pay, which enables motorists to pay for ERP fees using their credit cards. “When we extend our ecosystem, we hope to cater to different age groups and demographics in our society,” the CEO said. “We are not here to compete with others, but to stay relevant,” he added, saying that EZ-Link does not need to meet the needs of people at every point of their lives so long as it remains relevant at different stages and for different needs. For example, a young adult may use other payment methods for various activities but they may turn to EZ-Link for their motoring and parking needs, he said. “We want to make sure in the whole cradle to silver (generation) journey, people remain with us and that it’s a seamless experience.” Mr Lee also pointed to two other initiatives the company is looking at to encourage people to go cashless. Besides cutting down the EZ-Link activation period from days to a mere minute, EZ-Link is also looking to do away with charging a convenience fee of 25 cents per top up via the app from August. It is already being done for DBS, POSB and Citibank account holders, but it will be extended to other banks as it wanted to “incentivise people for going cashless”, he said. The company has also tied up with local convenience store chain Cheers to introduce loose change top ups. Consumers who receive change from their purchases there have the option of topping up their EZ-Link cards with the coins they will otherwise have to pocket, and for free, he explained. This was first announced in February this year, and the service is now available at all Cheers outlets, he said. That’s not all. The company has a roadmap extending into 2019 to digitalise its stored value card offering. Mr Lee said his people have been migrating the systems into a cloud-based one, so consumers can create a digital wallet linked to their existing CEPAS EZ-Link cards. In the future, people can go to a general ticketing machine, tap their cards and convert their offline wallet to an online one. The physical card can then act as a credit card of sorts, with value that can be topped up remotely. That, at least, is the plan. “We want to do this, and will, but the surrounding infrastructure for public transport will have to be upgraded too,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/we-are-slow-ez-link-ceo-on-shortcomings-and-going-digital-to-10579956"}, {"datetime": "02 Aug 2018 06:24AM", "tags": ["cybersecurity", "singhealth", "Internet", "cyberattacks", "MOH"], "author": "Benjamin Goh", "title": "Commentary: SingHealth data breach should give us pause to think what else might be vulnerable", "content": " SINGAPORE: The SingHealth cybersecurity breach that affected 1.5 million patients last week was allegedly carried out by attackers scheming to get the Prime Minister’s health information. The breach stirred up a discussion on social media, where netizens expressed frustration and lamented that this attack should cause Singapore to rethink its Smart Nation plans. But as the old adage in cyberspace goes: It is not if, but when, a system gets attacked. In our push to become a digitised and Smart Nation, cyberrisks are an inevitable hazard we must manage. As systems become more connected, they create a greater surface area— some might even say “a tempting target” — for belligerent actors to attack us. It has thus been encouraging that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong have been steadfast and reassuring in their response, telling us that despite this setback, we must be bold and continue making strides in digitisation. This incident is of course not isolated. As databases become more valuable, they will naturally attract the attention of hackers who wish to exploit them for commercial or political reasons. However, hackers are also looking for the path of least resistance to achieve their objectives. To prepare ourselves, we should look at not just patching the systems at SingHealth but also identifying the sources of weakest vulnerability across the entire nation. HOSPITALS EASY TO CRACK? This breach involved data systems within a hospital. Although the details retrieved are worrying because they were personal details and information, it is hardly surprising. As independent health care security researchers Scott Erven and Shawn Merdinger has shown, this is a global problem as hospitals around the world systematically leak information due to lacklustre patching and insecure device configuration.  There is no malice in doing so, only that medical devices deployed are often optimised for usability (rightfully so), with security often as an after-thought The most famous example of this is the pacemaker, which mimics the functions of a heart to allow an individual to survive without it. Although a significant medical breakthrough, news reports have highlighted that security was not built into the system, revealing vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to remotely alter information which could kill an individual. Similarly, because medical professionals need to perform life-saving work that is time-sensitive, dealing with the complexities of using tech and IT may naturally be de-prioritised. In the UK, cyberattacks have halted operations of at least 16 hospitals last year, causing many industry watchers to call hospitals an “easy target”. Even though SingHealth, and many other hospitals and healthcare providers in Singapore’s regional healthcare system, have made efforts to invest in cybersecurity measures, they are dealing with complex systems that need a lot of time to patch, and integrate into a workflow that might be at odds with how doctors work in order to optimise care for patients. And with the National Electronic Health Records progressively rolled out since 2011, these healthcare systems involve not just doctors but nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare staff including General Practitioners, polyclinic staff, therapists and technicians, just to name a few. According to the Ministry of Health, healthcare professionals from over 1,200 healthcare providers have access to patient records under this system as of December 2017, which is a significant attack surface if appropriate access controls are not put in place. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AT RISK Besides hospitals, one of the most vulnerable targets is educational institutions. Due to the large amount of research and information exchange carried out at these educational institutions, they are susceptible to attacks when students and staff visit non-secure sites or click on non-secure links to retrieve information (in downloading a journal paper from a free site instead of using a subscription for instance). In cases where professors are performing groundbreaking or politically-sensitive research, professors and students can be targeted in cases of industrial or political espionage. Harvard, for example, has been hacked multiple times due to the value of its precious research data. Just earlier this year, four local universities reported that their systems have been compromised. Even though no concrete details were released about the hack due to operational security reasons, experts interviewed suggested that the valuable research in these universities may have great commercial value. Given the pioneering biomedical and defence research performed in labs around Singapore, we can reasonably expect more hackers trying to probe these systems. NATIONAL DATABASES NEED SECURING Other than educational institutions, one should also worry about national databases held by the Government. The Government has done a fantastic job to provide reliable databases in order to deliver better services — our e-filing tax system under IRAS, for example, is much more accurate and updated than most governments. In the last few years, in order to push out more citizen-centric services, government agencies such as HDB and the Silver Generation Office have also worked closely with each other to share information in order to provide public services more efficiently. While the Government probably has a rigorous process to share, use, and destroy information, every instance of information-sharing creates a potential vulnerability. Hypothetically, for example, in the Medishield Life scheme, if CPF has to match information about our insurance policies with private sector insurers, data has to be duplicated to facilitate better working and testing, which creates an added opportunity for precious information to be stolen. MIND YOUR LIFESTYLE APP Finally, one of the spaces to watch is also that of lifestyle apps. Singaporeans are increasingly reliant on applications like Grab and FoodPanda in daily living. Knowing one’s commute or eating patterns can be of immense value to a hacker — the hacker can use one’s travel history to predict what time one will be at home, or answer security questions from the bank about the dates of your last travel. Just last year, Uber announced that there was a massive data breach of 370,000 users in Singapore, which suggests that at least these many people in Singapore might now be susceptible to financial or commercial ransom. As we move towards driverless cars, the situation could get more severe. As white-hat hackers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek famously showed us, a driverless Jeep Cheroke can be hacked remotely through its internet connection, putting the driver potentially in danger on the highway.  The growing number of hobbyists of drones could see their worst nightmare come true as their pride and joy are instead hijacked to become potential weapons or at very least instruments of mischief. DON’T RETREAT Risks are to be accepted and mitigated, but not be feared. Prime Minister Lee has shown astute leadership on this front, urging the country to press on with its digitisation plans. In a digitised country like Singapore, unplugging ourselves is not the option — in cybersecurity terms, “security through obscurity” is a fool’s errand. Instead, we should more aggressively push for companies and governments to adopt secure architecture practices, comply with international standards for data security, and enforce stringent data management standards. As then FBI Director Robert Mueller said in 2012 There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that will be. The fact that we are targeted shouldn’t be cause for alarm; that it encourages us to retreat away from a digitised world, should.

He decided to record and upload photographs and videos of the 17-year-old in the nude, as \"he wanted the victim to experience the same feeling of embarrassment that he had felt\", the court heard. The young man downloaded a motion-sensor application on his mobile phone that activates the camera when movement is detected. He also paid for an upgraded version of the app, which allows recording in high definition. On Jun 18, 2017, the man visited his cousin and placed his mobile phone at a compartment under the window of the kitchen toilet, with the camera facing upwards. He then activated his motion-detecting app. After taking a shower, the victim discovered the mobile phone. Without suspecting that he had recorded videos and photographs of her, she returned the phone to her cousin. A few months later, on Sep 3, 2017, the man uploaded eight photographs and two videos of his cousin to Tumblr.com, in a bid to humiliate her.

When she realised that the footage was taken at her home, she remembered finding her cousin's mobile phone in the toilet.  Her brother confronted the accused, who admitted that he had uploaded the footage online.

The accused did not inform the victim, whom he met online, about the risk of contracting HIV virus. The victim found out that his partner was HIV-positive only in 2015, after the investigating officer informed him about it, and testified that he would not have had sex with the accused if he had known about his HIV status.

This comes amid expectations for finance workers to see higher frequency of job changes moving ahead.  “Although the financial sector is creating jobs on a net basis, there is a tremendous amount of churn and financial industry professionals are moving into and out of jobs in large numbers, responding to changes in job roles and business models,” Mr Menon said.  This means that the industry will need to look at skills development, alternative career pathways and job placements in an “integrated manner” to navigate changes successfully, he added.  IBF’s chief executive Ng Nam Sin said the new career centre will boost ongoing efforts to equip workers with the right skills by raising the awareness of training opportunities – an area where nearly 80 per cent of finance professionals surveyed by IBF in June said they were unclear of.  The same survey done with about 1,000 respondents also showed that while about half believe in the importance of acquiring new skills, 41 per cent said they do not feel the urgency to do so.  This is slightly worrisome, Mr Ng told reporters at a briefing ahead of the launch.  “It took the personal computer 10 years to reach the mass market and it took the Internet 4 years to reach 50 million users. We think digital technology is going to be more viral and it will hit how we work and how we live much faster,” he said.  “So there’s an urgency for us to reskill and retrain ourselves.”  “IF THE CHANGES NEED TO COME, WE HAVE TO ACCEPT” As part of the Government’s transformation roadmap for the financial industry, PCPs, aimed at reskilling workers affected by changes in their job roles, have been launched at several banks here.  Citibank, which aims to re-skill 2,000 employees over the next three years, rolled out its PCP for about 400 employees two months ago. Over the next 12 months, these workers in front office and operations roles will undergo training in areas like design thinking, automation and cybersecurity.  In March, the bank also got some 1,600 employees to undergo IBF-accredited training in similar areas.  Over at UOB, digital training for its 900 customer-facing employees began last November.  Ms Janet Young, UOB’s head of group channels and digitalisation, said the bank will continue to work with IBF as it expands its PCP to beef up the digital skills of its employees. “With banks preparing their people for the roles of the future, IBF Career Connect will play an important role in helping to bolster the industry’s training efforts,” she added.  Being the first bank to launch its PCP last October, DBS said nearly two-thirds of its branch tellers have undergone training. The rest will do so within the next 12 months.  One of them is Ms Tricia Li, who has been with the bank for about 24 years after joining POSB as a bank teller in 1994.  The assistant service manager said she is no longer “just hiding behind the counter” dealing with specialised duties, such as account openings. Instead, she now has a broadened job scope that includes digital or advisory roles, such as guiding elderly customers to use the new digital service machines.  The usage of digital tools is also time-saving, while eliminating excessive paperwork and possibilities of errors, Ms Li added.  When asked if she felt worried about the pace of technological disruptions and how these have already rendered her previous job scopes redundant, the 43-year-old said: “No doubt there were some customers who said ‘Oh you’re going to be replaced by these machines’ but I told them no worries.”  “We have to be positive.

The company said in a blog post that it is starting work on the third facility located in Jurong West “just down the road\" from its first two buildings, and it would bring its long-term investment in local data centres to US$850 million. Previously, it said investments amounted to US$500 million when the second data centre was announced in 2015. It built its first Southeast Asia data centre here back in 2011, and added another four years later, due to the rapid growth in users and usage seen in the region, it said.  “The pace hasn’t slowed. In the three years since our last update, more than 70 million people in Southeast Asia started getting online for the first time, bringing the region's total to more than 330 million – that’s more than the whole population of the United States,” Mr Joe Kava, vice president of Global Data Centres at Google wrote.  “More businesses are getting online too, which has meant quickly growing demand for our expanding Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offerings,” Mr Kava added, pointing to customers like Singapore Airlines, Wego, Go-Jek and Carousell. It plans to get the third data centre up and running in 2020.  The multi-storey facility will be one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly sites in Asia in line with its global approach, Google touted.

I get it. Creativity is one of those ambiguous terms that means different things to different people. But at its heart it implies the consideration of, and experimentation with, new ideas and perspectives. For businesses that are creative, small and large, this often means operating in a significantly different manner from the norm – be it because of needed changes to their internal structure, business model or processes.  Creating an environment that encourages employees to think differently can be daunting at first, but might be necessary for companies to survive, grow or even exist. Take Singapore’s VendCafes. They serve food entirely through vending machines and are a great example of the way a daunting idea can translate into a successful business model. HOW CREATIVE IS SINGAPORE? As Oscar Wilde once put it:  An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all. This motto doesn’t seem to have reached all of us in Singapore yet. The nation ranked third in this year’s Bloomberg Innovation Index, surpassing the technology manufacturing powerhouse, Germany. Imagine what Singapore could achieve if we equal our strong focus and success in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines with creativity. While the local education system has been long reputed for producing academically outstanding students, it has also been accused of over-emphasising rote learning and high-pressure examinations.  A guaranteed-results-orientated culture may be contributing to the development of a populace unused to taking risks; a mindset people might likely adopt in the office. At least that’s what I have noticed having worked with many small business owners in Singapore. They can be less open to change compared to their counterparts in Asia, even if the market requires it.  In particular, many told me they lacked the manpower or money to challenge the status quo. The Singapore Government needs to help them gain the confidence, skills and guidance to make sound business decisions that ensure their legacy lives on. Instilling creativity into the workforce can make this vision a reality. How? By focusing on two of the biggest pain points. Firstly, creating an education system that fosters creative thinking from the ground up. And secondly, developing government support beyond monetary incentives when it comes to enabling businesses to grow, scale and adapt to change. SCHOOLS MUST ALLOW CREATIVITY TO FLOURISH Finland’s renowned education system is one Singapore should consider. Avoiding examinations, Finland allows students to lead investigations into real-life situations, with teachers acting as facilitators rather than steering students towards a specific answer. This encourages creativity and experimentation. Luckily, the Singaporean Government has started evolving its education system, with two particularly noteworthy initiatives already in progress. Its Applied Learning Programmes in schools, designed to help students apply their learning to the real world, will certainly help to develop innovative thinking. In addition, schools are looking to technology to encourage collaboration and critical thinking in the classroom, and I look forward to seeing how this might help children develop in ways unimaginable by cohorts of years past. At the same time, more must be done to ensure that children have a proper school-life balance. I empathise greatly with June Yong, a mother who says the intense curriculum doesn’t leave her children enough time to play and be creative on their own terms. She writes: In the name of owning a rigorous education system that is the envy of the world, and in the name of helping our children reach their fullest potential, what costs are we paying as a society?... Research has shown that kids with overly tight schedules are significantly less likely to score well on tests that require creative thinking. REKINDLING THE CREATIVE SPARK IN BUSINESS The Singapore Government has also poured significant resources into helping businesses evolve with the times. Multiple Industry Transformation Maps show the Government’s vision for updating – which often means digitalising – various economic sectors. Financial aid, such as the Productivity Solutions Grant and the Enterprise Development Grant announced in this year’s Budget, are part of this blueprint particularly designed to equip our businesses with the tools to implement change. Yet more needs to be done to encourage them to step out of their creative comfort zones, so Singapore can remain an internationally-competing economy. This starts with the core of any organisation: Its employees. The first thing that often springs to mind is the playground-like offices of famous US technology companies that offer music rooms (LinkedIn), slides (Google) or hammocks (Facebook) designed to make people feel creative and bear ideas which might even change the world, such as bringing live-navigation to people via Google Maps. But that’s not the only approach. Companies need to find a way to make employees feel more invested in the work they do, day in and day out. By creating a culture which encourages the contribution of creative ideas, supported by employee training to develop soft skills to help foster collaboration and a fluid exchange of ideas, organisations will naturally see employees start to challenge the norm. Ultimately, no creative idea will change the world if it stays an idea. Businesses also need the means to execute creative ideas in the first place: funds. This is a challenge that keeps small business owners awake at night. In fact, a Xero study found that nine out of 10 small businesses in Singapore have clients who pay late, which negatively affects their cash flow. If businesses struggle to break even, they might freeze non-essential business investments – which often includes those related to fostering creativity. On the other hand, a healthy cash flow provides a financial cushion that allows businesses to invest, experiment – and fail. Luckily, entrepreneurs can increasingly turn to technology to help stay on top of cash flow, with features like invoice reminders and online payment options working to reduce payment times for small businesses. Admittedly, igniting a creative spark is no small feat, but it’s increasingly necessary for businesses in Singapore to ensure that they continue to thrive in a rapidly transforming landscape.

Chefs celebrate National Day with souped-up hawker faves", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos SINGAPORE: If laksa, Hokkien mee and chilli crab are some of the things that make you proudest to be Singaporean, you’re in good company. This year, a number of local chefs and their restaurants have chosen to celebrate National Day by offering luxuriously souped-up versions – pun intended – of favourite hawker dishes and down-home classics that celebrate Singapore’s culinary heritage. Think Iberico Chee Cheong Fun, White Laksa made with somen, and Nasi Lemak Arancini. These are fervently embellished love poems to the country – which, happily, we diners can also taste. WHITE LAKSA AT THE SPOT Laksa, as we know it, is a delightfully dirty dish in the best sense of the word. But at modern European restaurant The Spot, executive chef Lee Boon Seng has created a version that is “clean and white”, just like the Singapore in his mind, he said. Faced with the impossible choice between the two versions of his favourite dish – assam laksa and Nyonya laksa – Chef Lee decided to combine their distinct flavours in one bowl, using selected ingredients from both. “And I made the choice to lighten the broth in both flavour and texture,” he said. He explained: “I’ve followed the traditional methods of making the laksa, but adapted them to make it lighter. For example, I used chilli padi to add heat instead of sambal, which makes it less oily. Then, I foamed up the sauce. I also deliberately used a more delicate noodle – Japanese somen – and added some brighter flavours in a salsa made from pickled ginger flower, pineapple, cucumber, beansprouts and chives. I then added an extra touch of luxury with butter-poached Boston lobster.\" In addition to the White Laksa (S$42), you can also sample “Orh Luak” Oyster Omelettes (S$9 per piece) featuring salt-baked French oyster on creamy scrambled eggs. Mixologist Drazen Alingasa is also in on the fun, offering up Kopiko (S$16), a drink of espresso and spice-infused reduced dark beer, served with a side of kaya toast; Gulamerah Sling (S$16), which mixes bandung up with gin, Cointreau and Cherry Heering; and Mr Bean (S$16), featuring soy milk and grass jelly with Famous Grouse whisky and a hint of pandan.

It is one of the few things that I seriously miss and crave when I am overseas,” said chef-owner Jeremmy Chiam of French-Japanese restaurant Le Binchotan. It’s also his go-to supper food, so he’s rolling it out as part of a Supper Special, available from 9.30pm onwards. “I would say that it is all about the broth in Hokkien mee,\" he shared. “I make it in way that’s similar to how I would make lobster bisque. Stock-making is one of the fundamental techniques in French cooking, and I apply the same methodology and principles to create the stock that forms the base of my broth.\" The stock is made from carrots, onions and celery. \"I also use lots of premium ingredients such as lobster shells, fresh prawns and prawn shells, scallops, bacon and pork belly.” The ingredients are then simmered for 10 hours. In addition to Hokkien mee (S$18), there’s also Chinese satay-inspired skewers of Iberico pork collar (S$17 for three skewers) marinated in gula melaka, garlic, lime, nutmeg and turmeric, grilled over Japanese binchotan charcoal and basted in French butter, served with a sauce of kicap manis with shishito, banana shallots and a dash of togarashi spice. Top it all off with a Bubur Cha Cha cocktail (S$16, available from 6pm onwards) made with taro-infused vodka, coconut, pandan and house-made tapioca jelly chunks. Available from Jul 27 to Aug 31. lebinchotan.sg IBERICO CHEE CHEONG FUN AT BOTANICO The humble chee cheong fun studded with bits of char siew is probably one of the last dishes you’d think of fancying up, but Chef Sujatha Asokan of contemporary European restaurant Botanico has chosen to do that as part of a National Day Exclusive Communal Brunch menu for Aug 9 (S$53 per person). “To me, chee cheong fun is a dearly beloved childhood dish, and is still one of my favourite dishes for breakfast and lunch,\" Chef Sujatha said. \"It’s so flexible – you can serve it plain, with shrimp or with pork, or even dough fritters.” For her, it's all about putting a new spin on it. “Our version has strong European elements. We’ve actually used cannelloni shells instead of the traditional rice sheets,” she explained. “The stuffing is also elevated – we’ve used Iberico pork belly cooked char siew-style with our own house-made marinade in our Inka oven. This filling is very rich and flavourful, so I serve this dish with some lightly pickled Japanese cucumber to refresh the palate.” In addition to the Iberico chee cheong fun, the National Day brunch menu also includes dishes such as Red Bass Conchiglie in XO sauce and a cold laksa pasta with poached prawns, inari, oyster aioli and laksa leaf crumbs. There are also special a la carte dishes from Aug 1 to 9, such as Crispy Baby Squid (S$13) with curry leaf in salted egg aioli; Stockyard Wagyu Petit Tender (S$34) featuring asam gelugur, tamarind sauce, charred leek flowers and potato terrine; and Lemongrass Panna Cotta (S$10) with ginger ice cream.

Start with a nasi lemak arancino, or stuffed rice ball, served with sambal aioli, move on to a chilli crab panzerotti or savoury turnover, and build up to laksa bucatini with mixed seafood piccante. End with deconstructed ice kachang or the tarik panna cotta with gula Melaka. “The ingredients and elements I use for the menu are mostly ingredients based on local elements, while the cooking technique is based on Italian and Mediterranean cuisine,” explained head chef Sunny Tiu. For instance, “Arancino is a dish from Sicily which is rice filled with ragu, tomato sauce and mozzarella, then coated with bread crumbs and deep fried. The rice elements of the Arancino inspired me to incorporate fragrant rice cooked with coconut milk and pandan leaves, and serve it with aioli flavoured homemade sambal and other side dishes.\" \"The nasi lemak is cooked with the same technique used to make risotto, but I replace butter and onions with coconut cream and pandan leaves.” As for the panzerotti, a dish typical of the region of Puglia consisting of fried dough usually filled with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, “the texture and flavour of the panzerotti are quite similar to that of a curry puff, so I was inspired to replace the usual filling with Singapore’s famous chilli crab instead,” Chef Tiu said.

The following week, there’ll be the Malay dish of Nasi Minyak with Lamb Rendang and Sayur Lodeh. Then, it’s the Indian dish of Dry Goat Curry with Briyani and Dhalcha, followed by the Peranakan dish of Nasi Ulam and the Eurasian dish of Birthday Noodles. This weekday set menu (S$30) is for two to share and includes two desserts and locally-inspired drinks. The dishes were chosen to showcase diversity, said Chef D’Silva, and many are family recipes. For instance, the Nasi Ulam, a rice dish of wolf herring, prawns and herbs, is made according to his maternal Peranakan grandmother’s recipe and features kaffir lime leaf, turmeric leaf, lemongrass, daun pegaga, pucuk gajus, ulam raja, kacang botol and long beans. “Nasi Ulam is supposed to be eaten slowly as the rice releases different flavours with every chew; these can be sweet, bitter, salty and sour all at once. It is a mind blowing experience,” he said. Eurasian Birthday Noodles, also known as Mee Anu in Cristang, is a less commonly known dish; it is eaten on birthdays to signify longevity. “Chopped garlic is fried with oil till fragrant, before pork and prawn stock are added and brought to a boil. Next, finely sliced pork tenderloin is added together with fresh peeled prawns to cook, followed by bean sprouts and egg noodles,\" Chef D’Silva explained. \"The dish is then cooked until the gravy has been absorbed by the noodles.\" The final garnish is thinly fried omelette that is julienned, sliced green and red chilies and Chinese parsley. “There is also a relish that is made out of cubed pineapple, cucumbers, chilies and sambal belacan that cuts the richness of the dish.” But the Braised Pork Trotters with Mooi Choy is the dish that he remembers best from his own birthdays, when his paternal Eurasian grandfather used to make it. “I believe it’s done the Hakka way, where dry spices like star anise, cinnamon and Chinese brown cardamom are braised together with dried fungus, dried scallop, orange peel, dates, dark soya, galanghal and sand ginger on a low flame until the pork trotters are meltingly tender.\" Available from Jul 30 to Aug 31 on weekdays for lunch. www.parkhotelgroup.com/en/destinationbeachroad/folklore LAKSA XIAO LONG BAO AT YAN Cantonese restaurant Yan’s annual National Day dim sum menu is getting a recharge this year with dishes like Steamed Xiao Long Bao in Laksa Stock accompanying popular favourites like Steamed Hainanese Chicken with Sticky Rice wrapped in Lotus Leaf. The laksa xiao long bao (S$5.80 for four) riffs off the well-received bak kut teh xiao long bao that they rolled out two years ago. This year, the delicate steamed dumplings feature fresh shrimp and a laksa broth prepared with house-made laksa chilli base, coconut milk and dried shrimps, said executive Chinese chef Lai Chi Sum. On the dim sum menu, there are also dishes like Pan-fried Singapore Chilli Crab Meat Bun (S$9 for three) and Deep-fried Chicken Satay Wonton (S$6.80 for three). But we wouldn’t blame you for hankering after the Steamed Hainanese Chicken with Sticky Rice wrapped in Lotus Leaf (S$4 apiece). The glutinous rice in this dish is steamed for an hour with ginger, garlic, lemongrass and pandan leaf. Chicken thigh, which has been stir-fried with a blend of traditional chicken rice spices, is then wrapped up with the rice in a lotus leaf, which adds its fragrance to the mix, and steamed further. It’s served with dark soy sauce, house-made chilli sauce and ginger sauce.

Don't be, NTU prof says", "content": " SINGAPORE: More of our personal data and financial information are moving online as Singapore moves forward to a digital-first, Smart Nation environment. Yet, recent cyberattacks here have planted seeds of doubts in some people's minds about the ability of institutions to safeguard such data and, more tangibly, money.   These recent cyberattacks included Singapore’s most serious personal data breach affecting 1.5 million citizens including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and fraudulent iTunes transactions leaving dozens of Apple customers hundreds if not thousands of dollars lighter in their wallets. Meanwhile, the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) this month realised it was a victim of a data breach that saw about 70,000 members’ personal particulars illegally accessed and copied in 2013 - about five years after the fact. Experts say cyberattacks are here to stay, and that reality has slowly, but surely, crept into the mainstream consciousness of people living in a globally connected city. It's a threat that has been looming for years. To better understand what businesses were dealing with, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) launched its Cyber Risk Management (CyRIM) project in May 2016. It was supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and five partners from the insurance industry. The project aims to use the data generated to understand how the insurance industry here is able to offer cyber insurance products that could help underwrite the risks involved, the varsity said then. And the man leading the CyRIM project, Professor Shaun Wang, is not surprised that the number of cyberattacks is growing. Channel NewsAsia spoke to the academic to find out more on his thoughts about cybersecurity, risk management and why it is prudent - and not at all counter-intuitive - for people to still keep some cold, hard cash stashed away for a rainy day. Q: Why do you think there is a rise in cyberattacks today? Prof Wang: We used to have people rob banks. Why? Because that’s where the money is. Nowadays, people don’t actually have to go and physically rob a bank. They can do that online and there are lots of people out there - we don’t see them - that are very active (in doing so). In fact, if someone physically robs a bank, it is pretty much captured through video, CCTV and all that. Online stealing, or cyberattack, or hacking - these leave very little trace. And it’s cross-border, making such cases hard to pin down.  And because of the very low enforcement rates in catching these hackers, there’s a mushrooming, flourishing underground market … especially in parts of the world where people don’t have other means of making a living. Q. Amid that backdrop, will Singapore banks get robbed the way the Bangladesh central bank did in 2016? Prof Wang: The Bangladesh bank case, where hackers got away with US$81 million, actually spoke very loudly that cybersecurity is a very global issue and is also cross-border (in nature). Singapore, like other countries, is not immune from such attacks. That said, the financial sector as a whole has learnt from such incidents. Going back to the Bangladesh bank heist, the money was subsequently transferred to the casinos in Philippines and some money was recovered. Big fines were also imposed on Philippines banks involved in the hack. This shows the financial sector has learnt from its mistakes. People don’t have to panic because the system - especially for money transfers - is now more resilient and there is a waiting period before money is released on request. Singaporean consumers, in particular, don’t have to worry about their bank accounts getting hacked and emptied as there are layers of protection to prevent such attempts. The banking system here is very strong, for instance, in terms of multi-factor authentication, and that is actually very effective to reduce risk because it’s not just having a password but you also have to have your phone with you. Q: Are you sure we don’t have to turn to a very low-tech life hack: Hiding our money in Milo tins? Prof Wang: No. There’s no need to go to that extreme. However, I would recommend every household to have some cash on hand. Because one scenario is not so much the hacking of bank accounts and stealing of money, but it’s business disruption. That’s a more realistic scenario. If you have a major disruption - this might not be in Singapore but from other places - and in order to avoid confusion and panicking, people having money at hand will make life a lot easier. One way of reducing risk is to build redundancy. Redundancy means yes, we’re moving into digital payments, but in order to have redundancy, I want to make sure there’s a hard copy of my bank account stored in a safe, so that I don’t forget them. And also to have some cash, so if there are a few days of business disruption, I still have money to buy bread. That would actually be helpful for the country, as it would mean avoiding a lot of unnecessary stress. Q: Much stock has been put into teaching our young to use the Internet safely and, in doing so, increase the overall awareness of online risks. Do you think enough is being done? Prof Wang: I have to say that Singapore is quite advanced in terms of equipping young people in cybersecurity skills. One thing to note, though: Singaporeans are very responsible. Elsewhere, not so much. People can go and be a hacker themselves, just to try. Here, it’s not easy to do that. Israel, for example, is very strong in cybersecurity, and the people there think there’s nothing wrong to explore things (like their system networks) - that’s part of national defence. Q: Would teaching young children how to hack create a more resilient people in today’s digital world then? Prof Wang: From a business point of view, and from the effectiveness of education stance, that’s very good. I think we should do that. But I think it should be supervised. For young kids, the best way of learning is to learn by doing. However, we want to make sure that the kids, once they learn a skill, that they will actually do responsible things, rather than try and move to the (dark) side. So, yes, they need to be 100 per cent supervised, but (hacking) is an essential skill and, in a global environment, one that would give them a competitive edge. Singapore is quite proactive in terms of supporting education programmes, but it’s also about culture: How do we empower students to be more creative? There’s no such thing as here are the things (to note for cybersecurity), and once you know it, you know how to defend. Cybersecurity is a game between defender and attacker, and the best defenders, they have to be creative. There isn’t a kind of guidebook that says if you do these things, then you’re all set. The best talents in cybersecurity are those people who are very creative and explore new things. It’s like police and thief in the digital age - the best ones know how to think like criminals.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/worried-your-money-in-the-bank-will-get-stolen-by-hackers-don-t-10576726"}, {"datetime": "31 Jul 2018 09:43PM", "tags": ["Health Promotion Board", "dining"], "author": "Tan Si Hui", "title": "Healthier version of nasi padang gets HPB seal of approval", "content": " SINGAPORE: Healthy eating may not come to mind when one orders a plate of nasi padang - a Malay meal consisting of steamed rice with a variety of side dishes that are rich in coconut and gravy.  But at Rumah Makan Minang, a restaurant in Kampong Glam, there are now five healthier dishes to choose from, prepared with healthier oil and fewer coconut ingredients. Customers can also choose red rice over white rice in a menu launched on Tuesday (Jul 31). The restaurant is the first nasi padang outlet to be endorsed by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) under its Healthier Dining Programme, which recognises eateries that offer lower calories meals and beverages with less sugar as a prominent part of their menus.  The healthier nasi padang meal contains only 400 calories per serving, compared to the 700 to 900 calories per serving that a regular plate of nasi padang would typically have. Rumah Makan Minang director Hazmi Zin said it took three to four months to conceptualise the dishes and he was initially hesitant about the idea.  “To cater to what HPB wanted was a challenge because we’ve been doing a routine every day,” said Mr Hazmi. In addition, he felt that red rice might not suit the taste of the other side dishes. He had initially wanted to serve 20 healthier option dishes.  But after doing a survey with his customers, he found out that a majority of them had liked the healthier option dishes that came with red rice.  Mr Hazmi said: “At the start, people who ate red or brown rice said it tasted funny. But after constantly eating it, it’s like eating white rice.”  He was eventually convinced to make healthier options available after being regularly persuaded by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Amrin Amin. Mr Amrin, who was present at the launch of the new menu, said it is not just the Malay community that needs to exercise healthier choice options, but the entire Singaporean community, across all races. He noted that habits take time to change, especially those that have formed over time. “It cannot just be the part of the government.

It now offers healthier dishes - braised duck kway teow, noodle and porridge. Yu Kee Group director Seah Qin Quan said over the five weeks, they have seen 60 per cent of customers who ordered braised duck noodle opting for wholegrain noodles. “The feedback from them is that it doesn’t vary so far from the normal noodles. Sometimes they don’t even know it’s whole grain noodles,” said Mr Seah. The hawker food chain has already rolled out the healthier option food choices to all of its 29 outlets.

Lombok, where her 20-year-old daughter was, had been hit by an earthquake.  Ms Ruhil Imani, was in Labuan Pandan on the Indonesian island with 19 others as part of a National University of Singapore (NUS) Muslim Society trip to provide environmental and social aid. They had left Singapore on Jul 23 and were due to be back on Aug 5. Her 51-year-old mother turned on the television and called relatives in Surabaya, Indonesia to find out more, but she heard no word on her daughter. \"I could not do anything - want to eat also cannot. I just cried and prayed. I was holding my phone and took it everywhere,” she said. At least 16 people have been killed and more than 330 injured in the 6.4 magnitude quake on Sunday. It was only when her daughter called about three hours later that Madam Syamsiah calmed down. The group cut short their trip and returned to Singapore on Tuesday. CHEERS, TEARS, HUGS There were cheers, tears and hugs as the group emerged from the Changi Airport arrival area at about 3.30pm. While Madam Syamsiah was in touch with her daughter before she returned home, she continued to be anxious until she saw Ms Ruhil in the flesh.  Her relief was visible, as she repeatedly hugged and kissed her daughter. Ms Ruhil and her team members were also in tears as they embraced their family members. “WE JUST SAT DOWN DURING THE EARTHQUAKE” Recounting the experience, which she described as “scary”, Ms Ruhil said that she and the rest of the members were sitting on the beach, after catching a magnificent sunrise. “I was watching children throwing pebbles into the sea. It was peaceful,” she said. Then there was a rumble and for about 10 seconds, Ms Ruhil and her friends were trying to make sense of what was happening, she said. “We were clueless until we saw the villagers running away from the beach,\" she said. They followed suit and were advised to stay outdoors in case any roofs collapsed. They continued to experience aftershocks. \"Every aftershock was a mental trauma,\" said team leader Mohammad Azfar Sa'ari, 23.  Guided by Mr Mohamad Tahar Jumaat, 50, the facilitator of the trip, the group made their way to Sembalun in the northeast of Lombok, where many relief agencies are based.  It was only when they reached Sembalun that they managed to call their families. When they were given a choice whether to stay on, team leader Mohammad Azfar Sa'ari decided against it. \"Parents kept asking their kids to go home, and they wanted to go home as well, so I made the call,\" he said. CROSSING A DAMAGED BRIDGE  The journey to Sembalun was not without obstacles.  Apart from seeing collapsed roofs and debris, the group had to cross a damaged bridge on foot, as its structural integrity had been damaged, and driving across it in their van might have made things worse. That was when the instincts of safety officer Raihan Mohamad kicked in. Mr Raihan, 21, a first-year mechanical engineering student, had served as a medic in the Singapore Civil Defence Force during his National Service and attended a one-day workshop to prepare for the expedition. Mr Raihan stood in the middle of the 200m-long bridge and guided his teammates across. At one point, the area he stepped on shook a little, and he advised the rest not to walk there. \"I was able to respond faster because of the training,\" he said. When the group got to Sembalun, they sang songs to distract themselves as they waited for information on flights. They found out about the flight on Monday, and left for Singapore on Tuesday at 6.50am Indonesia time. They counted themselves lucky. \"It's a great relief that everyone is back and well,\" Mr Azfar said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lombok-quake-nus-students-return-indonesia-10577572"}, {"datetime": "31 Jul 2018 08:01PM", "tags": ["National Day", "Singapore Police Force"], "author": "", "title": "National Day Parade 2018 declared an 'enhanced security special event': Police", "content": " SINGAPORE: National Day Parade 2018, which will be held at The Float @ Marina Bay on Aug 9, has been declared an \"enhanced security special event\" under the Public Order Act.

The lab was jointly set up by Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Surbana Jurong and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF). Made of special materials such as nanotechnology fibres, the chilled ceiling panels filter the air while potentially saving up to 30 per cent in energy consumption compared to a conventional air-conditioning duct system. The research project could become a reality over the next five years under a partnership between NTU and Surbana Jurong.  The lab, which was jointly funded by NTU, Surbana Jurong and government agencies, aims to develop sustainable solutions to tackle urban challenges such as energy and infrastructural needs, as well as climate change.  As the sixth corporate lab in NTU, 70 researchers and engineers from both the university and Surbana Jurong will work together to explore underground storage systems, sustainable indoor solutions for buildings and digital technologies to ramp up productivity in the built environment. “Based on our experience with other corporate labs, we’ll have new technologies and spin-off companies that will come out,” said NTU president, Professor Subra Suresh. “The ideas that are developed jointly as part of this corporate lab will be embedded in construction by an entity like Surbana Jurong, as they do consultancy work for megaprojects all over the world. That’s the real benefit of a project like this.\" One up-and-coming city in the Philippines where Surbana Jurong is looking at rolling out its solutions is New Clark City, said its group CEO Wong Heang Fine.  “Currently we are doing a project in New Clark City. It’s a greenfield project where new buildings are going to come up,” Mr Wong said, referring to unused lands. “Some of the new technologies you see here could well be implemented in the buildings and townships that we build in New Clark City.”  For a start, researchers will explore how underground spaces can be used to store liquified natural gas to free up space aboveground for other uses.  At the same time, a \"cold lab\" will also be set up to harness cold energy produced during regasification, or the process by which liquified natural gas is converted back to natural gas at normal temperatures, from below 162 degrees Celsius.  The cold energy can then be used to power industrial uses, such as cooling systems in buildings like warehouses. ACCELERATOR PROGRAMME FOR BUILT ENVIRONMENT IN THE WORKS While the lab is the 12th to be supported by the NRF, it is the first to focus on creating and developing solutions for the built environment sector, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who officially launched the lab. “It is a timely move because there is tremendous potential to transform our built environment through new technologies,” said Mr Wong, who is also Second Minister for Finance.  He also announced the setting up of a new accelerator programme for built environment startups and companies, to bring in solutions from both local and overseas companies to the market.  This will be done through matching companies to industry hosts, facilitating access to investor funding and business networks, and providing mentorship opportunities to companies. Taking the lead will be the Housing and Development Board (HDB), which will expand its initiative involving the public to co-create solutions to improve the public housing environments.  First launched in 2011, the “Cool Ideas for Better HDB Living” initiative will be expanded to include submissions from companies as well, providing opportunities for piloting new solutions. So far, the initiative has received more than 800 ideas from individuals. “These efforts will not only bring good solutions to benefit our HDB residents, but also allow our enterprises to showcase their innovations in our HDB estates, and eventually export these solutions overseas,” Mr Wong said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chilled-ceiling-tech-that-purifies-air-cools-buildings-being-10577270"}, {"datetime": "31 Jul 2018 05:03PM", "tags": ["Ministry of Home Affairs", "Immigration and Checkpoints Authority"], "author": "", "title": "Leadership changes at ICA and Home Team Academy", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will be headed by a new commissioner from Sep 3, as part of leadership changes announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday (Jul 31).  Mr Marvin Sim, 47, will take over as ICA Commissioner from Mr Clarence Yeo.  Mr Sim was a former senior director of Joint Operations Group at MHA.

These 820 million bags can cover the land area of 126 Gardens by the Bay, and the petroleum used in their production can power 1.9 million car rides across the length of the island and back, the SEC said. For context, each person in England used 133 plastic bags in 2013, when major supermarkets there gave out more than 7.4 billion bags. This was before large retailers in the UK were required by law in October 2015 to charge for plastic bags they gave out. The use of single-use plastic bags declined drastically after the charge was introduced, with 2.1 billion bags sold between April 2016 and April 2017, according to the UK government website. SEC chairman Isabella Huang-Loh said told reporters on Tuesday (Jul 31) that plastic bag usage in Singapore has \"quantumly grown\" over the years. \"We started three decades ago trying to educate people to go hygienic with plastic bags,\" she said, referring to campaigns that encouraged the bagging of waste before disposal down the chute. It went down so well that over time people became too enthusiastic, she added, and they started taking more than what they really needed. The study, conducted between December 2017 and May 2018, is based on online surveys from 1,003 respondents based in Singapore. \"The results of the study show that there are certain gaps in the plastic ecosystem,” Ms Huang-Loh said. “Key outcomes must be plastic reduction at every segment of the plastic ecosystem for individuals, businesses, communities, government agencies and statutory boards,” she added, pointing out that the study will help focus public education aimed at reducing plastic use. The study found that 49 per cent of respondents use three or more plastic bags every time they visit the supermarket, including 14 per cent who use six or more bags on each trip. Only 15 per cent bring their own bags for their shopping. When it comes to demographics, the elderly are likely to use more plastic bags. Almost a quarter of those aged 60 and above said they take six or more plastic bags per shopping trip, while only 6 per cent bring their own bags. Women were also almost twice as likely to bring a reusable bag as compared to men. When asked about their preferred use for the plastic bags they have taken, the majority of respondents said they use it to bag and dispose of waste, while 11 per cent said they reuse them. Only 2 per cent said they recycle the bags. PLASTIC BAG CHARGE? While the plastic bag charge seems to have worked for the UK, SEC executive director Jen Teo said reducing usage here has to start with education as it will \"drive longer term benefits in terms of behavioural change\". \"In some of the countries where the charge has been introduced, there has been some reduction in plastic bags for a period of time, but over the longer term the use of plastic bags will then increase,\" she explained. For instance, in Taiwan, Ms Huang-Loh said the charge worked very well for the first two years, but usage went up again as people \"got used to paying\". \"Instead of going so far into draconian measures right now, try reduction first,\" she added. \"Once we ask people to reduce, and once it bottoms out or there's absolutely no way it's going there, then we have to review the whole process.\" NTUC FairPrice director of corporate communications and brand Jonas Kor said the supermarket's stance on charging for plastic bags remains unchanged. \"Our stand is very much that charging should come about only with legislation,\" he said. \"But the focus we have is very much public education to get people to be aware of consumption habits.\" NEW CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PLASTIC WASTE With supermarkets holding off on what some environmentalists deem a necessary tax on plastic bags, and the Government preferring alternative approaches to reduction, SEC has announced a new campaign to reduce plastic bags. The campaign, themed Two is Enough, will encourage consumers to only take two plastic bags on each shopping trip. It will also involve call-to-action measures like training cashiers, consumer education and eco-friendly tips. SEC will also target specific demographic groups highlighted in the study to make messaging more effective. For example, the campaign will be conducted in a number of languages to cater to those aged above 60, while SEC will work with reusable bag retailers to come up with \"cool-looking bags men can carry in pockets\", Ms Huang-Loh said. Apart from plastic bags, the study also identified another major source of plastic waste. It revealed that 467 million polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and 473 million polypropylene (PP) plastic disposables are used in Singapore each year. This works out to between one and three PET bottles and PP disposable items per person per week. PET bottles are commonly used for drinks, sauces and marinades, while PP disposables include takeaway containers. To that end, SEC will launch another campaign, themed One Less Plastic, to encourage consumers to use one fewer item in each disposable plastic category, ranging from cutlery to water bottles. This campaign will involve call-to-action measures like incentives for Bring Your Own (BYO) initiatives and marketing exposure for eco-friendly eateries with sustainable practices. Both campaigns will be launched online, on social and traditional media, and at points-of-sale starting next month till the end of next year. SEC is also working with organisations to help educate consumers on reducing plastic waste. Among the first to come on board are NTUC FairPrice and Coca-Cola. Ms Teo hopes the new campaign will prove more effective than previous BYO campaigns with the introduction of specific targets in the call-to-action. \"We've got to move on to much harder programmes that will really bring a more meaningful drive, not just 'I don't get this this particular day',\" Ms Huang-Loh said, referring to once-a-week BYO programmes. RECYCLING AND DOWNSTREAM INNOVATION While the campaign's first phase will focus on reducing, its next two phases will target recycling and downstream innovation. For recycling, SEC will educate consumers on why, what and how to recycle across various channels. As for downstream innovation, SEC will raise awareness on plastic afterlife and support closed-loop ecosystems for plastic recycling. This comes as the study highlighted the reasons behind Singapore's stagnant plastic recycling rate. Based on survey responses, these include inconvenience and not being fully aware of the types of recyclable plastic. In turn, the study also found that the recycling industry faced challenges like labour constraints, a low demand for recycled goods and lack of investment in automation technology. This was based on in-depth interviews with nine stakeholders ranging from academia to industry experts. The study’s results will be incorporated into a more extensive research report on the use of plastic by consumers and the waste ecosystem in Singapore, which will be made available at the SEC Conference Day on Aug 30. On that day, SEC will host consumers, businesses and downstream stakeholders like waste companies to build a plastic ecosystem and “discuss and identify a clearer focus”. “We should take advantage of available innovation or seek new innovation to create a downstream market for recycling plastic in Singapore,” Ms Huang-Loh said, noting new technologies to convert plastic to fuel, and the use of recycled plastic for 3D printing. “We need to address extended producers’ responsibility at the upstream too.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/plastic-bags-supermarkets-singapore-tax-sec-10576660"}, {"datetime": "31 Jul 2018 02:45PM", "tags": ["crime", "trading", "stocks", "CIMB"], "author": "", "title": "Former CIMB vice president receives 5-year prohibition order for insider trading", "content": " SINGAPORE: A former vice president of CIMB Bank Berhad was slapped with a five-year prohibition order for insider trading with effect from Monday (Jul 30), said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

Joel Yeo Junwei was one of four people from training provider Biz HR Solutionz Pte Ltd, who was charged in July last year for abusing the scheme, which aims to promote skills development by providing all Singaporeans aged 25 and above with credits worth S$500 to sign up for courses. Biz HR was also one of three training providers suspended in 2016 from funding and grant assistance by the then-Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), following an audit that year. Yeo faced 26 charges for falsifying course attendance records for Biz HR, SSG said in the media release. Yeo, who was hired in early 2016, signed off attendance records between February and Mar 29 that year even though he had not conducted the courses, SSG said. He was instructed to do so by his employer, former Biz HR director Eric Zheng Zhenwei, SSG said. Yeo also helped Zheng to sign more attendance records for the audit conducted by WDA. Zheng and two others, Tan Yu Sheng and Sim Chee Kiong, have been sentenced to jail for abusing the credit scheme, SSG said.  The three of them had promoted Biz HR courses to their own contacts and offered a S$200 cash incentive in exchange for their credits, SSG added.  Zheng also instructed Tan and Sim to tell their contacts that they would receive cash even if they do not attend the course, SSG said. Zheng was slapped with 150 charges for instigating trainees to cheat WDA into disbursing credits to Biz HR, for conspiring with Tan or Sim to instigate trainees to cheat WDA into disbursing credits to Biz HR for inflated claims, and for producing false course attendance records during the audit in 2016, SSG said. Tan faced 22 charges while Sim faced 18 charges for conspiring with Zheng, SSG said. Zheng was sentenced to 36 months' jail on Feb 27. Tan was jailed eight months while Sim was sentenced to six months' jail on Dec 19 last year, SSG said.  Three of them have made full restitution, SSG said. Zheng paid S$63,250, Tan paid S$5,400 and Sim paid S$5,330 to WDA. Meanwhile, Yeo paid S$2,000 to the State. \"SSG takes a serious view of any individual, training provider or organisation that abuses its funding schemes, and will not hesitate to take action against those who contravene its funding rules and guidelines,\" SSG said. \"This includes any individual who misleads another person in using their SFC.\" Any individual found guilty of providing false information to SSG in relation to his or her application may be fined up to S$10,000 and/or jailed for up to 12 months.  Editor's note: Joel Yeo Junwei was sentenced to seven weeks' jail for abusing the SkillsFuture Credit scheme.

He said both governments saw the issues of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project and the 1962 water agreement as matters that needed to be tackled, but nevertheless should not be obstacles to maintaining good relations. Saifuddin noted that Malaysia and Singapore wanted to further boost bilateral relations. Saifuddin was on his first official visit to Singapore at the invitation of his Singaporean counterpart Dr Vivian Balakrishnan. It was also part of his introductory visits after being sworn in as the new foreign minister on Jul 2. Saifuddin, who arrived in Singapore on Monday (Jul 30) for a two-day visit, was accompanied by officials from the Malaysian foreign ministry. The minister had, earlier on Monday afternoon, called on President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong after being hosted to a luncheon by Dr Balakrishnan. According to Saifuddin, the HSR and water issues were raised during his meeting with Dr Balakrishnan and Mr Lee. “I tried my level best to explain the situation,” he told Bernama. “We are looking at the big picture ... As far as our bilateral relations (are concerned) ... our ties are strong and we want to work hard to bring it to greater heights,” said Saifuddin, who was scheduled to call on Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on Tuesday. HSR DISCUSSIONS WILL TAKE PLACE \"VERY SOON\" On the HSR, Saifuddin said he had informed them that on Jul 23, economic affairs minister Mohamed Azmin Ali had written to his Singaporean counterpart saying that he would travel to Singapore to discuss the matter. “It will take place very soon,” said Saifuddin, adding that, “I stated the fact that we want to sit down and discuss.” Following the Pakatan Harapan forming the new government in Malaysia after the 14th general election on May 9, Malaysia took a stand to negotiate a deferment of the HSR project with Singapore. The previous Barisan Nasional government in Malaysia and the Singapore government had agreed to jointly undertake the HSR project, which will cut travelling time between both countries. PROPOSALS ON THE 1962 WATER AGREEMENT On the 1962 water agreement, Saifuddin said he had underlined the fact that there could be a review as this was stated in the agreement. “There is a clause about a review that surely we can look at,” he said, adding he understood that Singapore had its own perspective. “They brought the issue of water treatment. I think proposals and counter proposals can be brought to the table when we have a proper discussion,” he said. He said there were discussions in the past but there was no progress. “Surely we can continue the discussion. The agreement says the content of the agreement can be reviewed after 25 years. It doesn’t mean at 25 years ... so we can continue talking,” he added. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has expressed displeasure with the agreement saying it was unfavourable to Malaysia and wanted it renegotiated. Singapore subsequently said it will fully honour the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement and expects Malaysia to do the same. Speaking in Parliament earlier this month, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishan reiterated Singapore’s “clear and consistent position” on the issue.  He said the water pact is no ordinary agreement, and is guaranteed by both Singapore and Malaysia in the 1965 Separation Agreement. The Separation Agreement, he added, was in turn registered with the United Nations. “Any breach of the 1962 Water Agreement would call into question the Separation Agreement, which is the basis for Singapore’s very existence as an independent sovereign state,” he said. He also said that Malaysia lost its right to review the price of water under the Water Agreement in 1987: \"We have made this point publicly on multiple occasions.\" This point was further emphasised on Tuesday, with a statement from Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which said that Singapore’s leaders when meeting with Saifuddin emphasised the importance of abiding strictly by agreements and contracts related to water and the HSR whilst exploring potential new areas of collaboration.

Lo Ji Sum, a sales manager, met his alleged accomplice Khoo Fook Mun, a shipping executive who is of the same age, on the Sammyboy Forum website.  They used the site, as well as other similar websites, to watch videos of women undressing. Court documents said they have known each other for more than 20 years. In early July 2016, the two men were having breakfast at a coffee shop when they began discussing how women dressed. They made a plan to roam around a block of flats in Queenstown to see if they could watch any woman changing. They planned to do this at around 8am as women would be getting ready for work at that time, court documents said. TARGETS PICKED AT COFFEE SHOP Lo and Khoo visited three blocks in Queenstown as they were near Khoo's workplace and they could go to nearby coffee shops to eat. While eating, they took note of which units had lights on in them, and later checked on the units to see if there were any women inside. Khoo was on the lookout while Lo recorded videos of the victims. They picked units with silver grilles and windows so that Lo's phone, which was silver, would be less visible. They carried this plan out about 15 times in July 2016.  Their victims included a pair of sisters aged 29 and 33. On the morning of Jul 25, 2016, the sisters were in their bedroom getting ready for work. Their bedroom faced the common corridor and the row of louvre windows at the top half was open. The two men walked past the victims' unit in search of women dressing for work and noticed that the louvre windows were not secured. Lo took his iPhone 6S Plus and slid it through the window with the camera facing down. He took two photos and two videos of one of the sisters changing from a towel into her work clothes, while Khoo kept a lookout. Lo then took two photos and two videos of the other sister. The videos showed her changing out of a towel into work clothes, while the photos showed her putting on make-up. When she turned around and saw Lo's phone, she shouted and Lo immediately withdrew his phone and ran away with Khoo. Later that same day, Lo used the Airplay function on his iPhone to send the two videos of the first sister to Khoo. NABBED BY POLICE IN QUEENSTOWN  Police identified the two men and arrested them at a lift lobby in Queenstown on Aug 1, 2016, while they were preparing to scout for women again. Forensic investigations on Lo's phone revealed three obscene photos of Lo and his wife in the nude. Further investigations showed that Lo had sent these photos to Khoo in 2015. Other devices including a Macbook Pro and thumbdrives were seized as case exhibits after the men were arrested. Forensic investigations found 1,424 video files containing the same number of films without a valid certificate in Lo's possession. Lo also had 413 obscene films. On Tuesday, District Judge Carol Ling sentenced Lo to 12 weeks' jail on six charges of insulting the modesty of a woman, distributing obscene material and offences under the Films Act. He was also fined S$20,000 for possessing films without a valid certificate. Lo could have been jailed for up to a year and fined for insulting the modesty of a woman, and jailed for up to three months and fined for distributing obscene material by electronic means. For possessing uncensored films, he could have been fined at least S$100 per film up to a total of S$20,000.

Located at JTC Food Hub @ Senoko and operated by SIT, the 1,130 sqm facility will have eight production rooms, which will be rented out to companies for small batch production. SIT said it is still working out the details of the tenancy agreement.  Food processing equipment such as spray dryers and extruders, as well as advanced equipment that could cost more than S$1 million, will also be available to companies on a pay-per-use basis.   The JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, which started operations in July last year, currently houses eight food companies. Two more companies will set up next month. JTC Food Hub offers shared facilities and services to help to reduce capital and operating costs. One such feature is an integrated cold room and warehouse facility that tenants can tap on a pay-per-use basis.  One company that has benefited from this is Tenderfresh Fried and BBQ Chicken, which said it has seen a 20 per cent increase in productivity.  Mr Jimmy Soh, managing director of Tenderfresh, said: “The modular units at Food Hub has given us the flexibility to combine two factory units for a larger factory floor. \"This has allowed us to consolidate our operations, redesign our production layout and make further investments in automation,\" he said.  According to SIT, more than 15 companies have already expressed their interest in the shared facility for small batch food production.  On top of hardware support, the JTC Food Hub will also have workplace training courses, masterclasses and seminars.   Speaking at the official opening ceremony of JTC Food Hub on Tuesday, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Education Chee Hong Tat said a lack of scale and in-house capabilities could hinder food companies from innovating.  \"SMEs (small- and medium-size enterprises) in particular may find it difficult to do small batch production to test their new ideas, as the equipment is expensive and outsourcing to a contract manufacturer requires a larger minimum order size than what they need,\" said Mr Chee.  \"This increases the cost of experimentation and has resulted in a low commercialisation rate,\" he added.

For this, it will forfeit its 1 per cent deposit.  The boutique developer in an SGX filing attributed the move to “adopt a more prudent and circumspect approach towards new projects” to the impact of recent property curbs on market sentiment and purchasers’ interest.  Experts have said that the unexpected policies announced on Jul 5 fuelled two worries for property developers.  First, the prospect of higher land acquisition costs given an extra non-remissible five per cent Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) for residential land purchases.  Second, the fear of a demand slowdown as home buyers face a hike in ABSD rates and tightened loan-to-value (LTV) limits. This worries developers, particularly due to an increase in the remissible ABSD rate to 25 per cent, which can only be waived if they sell all their units within five years. For Tee Land’s U-turn, the latter was likely a key consideration since the extra acquisition tax will not be applicable with the deal being done prior to the new cooling measures, experts said.  “There might be some worries about matching demand with supply that is coming in, especially with the fears of softening demand” said CBRE’s research head for Singapore and Southeast Asia Desmond Sim, who estimated new units coming on stream to be “in the region of 45,000 to 50,000” following an en bloc fever for more than a year.  “Losing out on the deposit for a relatively smaller piece of land is still probably cheaper than going ahead to incur development cost and ABSD, which are costly for small- to mid-scale developers,” he added.  Throw in additional risks, such as a rising interest rate environment and currency fluctuations due to lingering trade tensions,  and it was a “prudent” move on Tee Land’s part, said International Property Advisor's chief executive Ku Swee Yong.  “They are a relatively small player so their cost of borrowing is not low. If you combine that with expected slower pace of sales and how you have to incentivise your property agents with higher fees to move the product, the project may not be that attractive after all.”  Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo from the National University of Singapore (NUS) agreed that smaller property developers are more vulnerable to the latest round of cooling measures.  “They may not have enough financial strength or a big land bank compared to bigger developers who can afford to hold and adjust the portfolio accordingly,” he said, while adding that it is “rational” for smaller players to take on a more cautious approach.  Despite that, experts do not expect more of such U-turns even as the housing curbs look set to put a damper on the buoyant collective sale market.  “What happened shows that the measures have pushed a lot of developers to re-work their sums and rejig their strategies, but I think most of them that have acquired land will most likely want to hold on to what they have,” said Mr Sim. “Because as a developer, your biggest raw material is land.”  Instead, developers will likely become more selective when adding to their land bank, scrutinising sites for their size, location and price expectations, experts added.  “When the developers think about bidding for a site, they have to consider an extra ABSD and higher interest expense over the next few years. Even if your site is very attractive, they are very likely to bargain for a lower price because these eat into their expected profits,” said Mr Ku.  EN BLOC HOPEFULS HOLDING ON  For en bloc hopefuls, the U-turn by a property developer will likely dampen confidence further though some are holding out. Owners of Gilstead Mansion in Novena were left disappointed when their en bloc deal with a listed small-cap developer fell through a day after the cooling measures were implemented. “We were on the brink of signing the contract on Jul 6 but it was called off due to the cooling measures,” said the condo's property consultant Sieow Teak Hwa. “Obviously, the homeowners were disappointed.” Mr Sieow, the managing director of TeakHwa Real Estate, added that the developer cited the need to await stability in the market, as well as monitor how buyers will react to the new measures.  The condo has since entered a private treaty phase and remains in talks with developers. According to laws governing collective sales, owners may negotiate for a sale via a private treaty contract with a buyer within 10 weeks from the close of the public tender. Mr Terence Lian, investment sales head at Huttons Asia, said Tee Land’s announcement further reaffirmed its decision to extend the tender deadlines for two of its projects – Katong Plaza and Fortune Park.  “(News about Teck Guan Ville) really caught us by surprise as it is a smaller site and I believe the number of units that will be redeveloped should be cleared within five years,” he told Channel NewsAsia.  “This sends another signal to the market that developers are really adopting a wait-and-see attitude.”  For Fortune Park, a 68-unit freehold condominium in Kovan, Mr Lian said that since the tender was launched two weeks ago, developers have expressed their need for “more time to re-evaluate the impact” of the new cooling measures.  Extending the closing date to Sep 14, from the previously announced Aug 17, will also give property developers leeway to digest the review of the development charge rate set for September, he added.  For its mega sites, such as Pine Grove and Kensington Park, work to garner the 80 per cent mandate remain underway though Mr Lian stressed that there is “no hurry” so as “to let the dust settle first”.  At Pine Grove, Huttons Asia has attained approvals from 77 per cent of owners, while it is planning for further engagement with homeowners at Kensington Park where there has been “very little progress” from its current consent level of 70 per cent.  Meanwhile, the tender closing date for the second collective sale attempt of Horizon Towers has also been postponed by another month to Sep 12. Developers have similarly expressed the need for “more time to observe and re-assess the market going forward”, according to marketing agent JLL.  However, JLL’s regional director of capital markets Tan Hong Boon remained cautiously optimistic, while noting that none of the firm’s en bloc projects have been put on hold due to the cooling measures.  “Now, it’s about adjusting to the prices, both for the buyers and sellers, but we think the market will recover because fundamentally, the demand-supply equilibrium is pretty OK.”  Mr Sieow also said he remains confident that Gilstead Mansion will be able to find a buyer.  The 24-unit condo in Novena is in a “good location” and the expected price of at least S$68 million remains “attractive”.  “Before the cooling measures, the en bloc market was already slowing but we were able to find a buyer due to a good location and attractive price. If not for the cooling measures, we would have been one of the rare deals that have gone through,” added Mr Sieow.  “I believe it should sell soon during the private treaty period.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/property-cooling-measures-en-bloc-deals-developers-10574492"}, {"datetime": "31 Jul 2018 06:21AM", "tags": ["Consumers Association of Singapore", "pressure selling", "spas", "slimming centre"], "author": "Gary Low", "title": "Commentary: One man’s tale of resisting the seducing spa sirens of Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: It sang to me like a siren to Odysseus. It sat silently in my inbox, but its call was deafening and irresistible. It was a Groupon voucher for S$38 for a one-time body analysis, consultation and fat reduction session at a spa located in the heart of the city. Guaranteed visible results without the prohibitive cost and hassle of liposuction, I thought.  I’ll be honest about why I was attracted to this. For one, it’s cheap. And the cheapness in me I cannot deny. For another, a decade of being a stress-fuelled binge eating, beer guzzling twenty-something was long over but the consequences persisted and visibly at that. And I was lazy. Why spend months sweating it out in the gym or early mornings jogging in the park when an inexpensive session in comfortable settings is all that is required? So I clicked, and that was that. POSH FACADES The facade of the spa was posh, with deep maroon and velvety furniture and fixtures, and dim lighting, giving off a sense of comfort and luxury. Music played in the background, and a light breezy scent filled the air, perhaps for the same purpose why frankincense and myrrh were once used, to distinguish patrician from plebeian. The ladies who greeted me were polite to a fault and very friendly. Indeed, my visual, auditory and olfactory senses were already overpowered; I felt disarmed.   I was casually led to a room and asked to partially disrobe. It was explained to me that the machine used to analyse my body composition required skin contact. The machine had sparkly bits and bobs, and whirred inconspicuously. It was over in a matter of minutes. THE BAD NEWS AND THE GOOD NEWS The spa clinician sat me down over a cup of tea, steam wisping over the cool air. She said, glancing sternly at the machine printout, there was nothing overtly alarming about the numbers. But things were not ideal either. I had higher than normal bodily fat deposits in certain key areas, and these may have health implications. The visible consequence was that my body was disproportionate. The insinuation was that my body was both unhealthy and ugly. I was evidently a walking, expiring, conference pear. She then took me to an adjacent, posh-looking room. While in my state of semi-undress, she casually mentioned that the trial session I was entitled to would not yield immediate results. Instead, I should consider upgrading to a different and technologically more advanced treatment package. A fearsome looking machine would then target and shoot invisible beams and freeze my recalcitrant fat cells, and thereafter have them somehow vapourised, she said. Okay, I started to think, Darth Vader was trying to sell me the Death Star. She passed me a pamphlet with a lot of words. It included a picture of a local celebrity with a lithe body and a charming smile. Wow, if a celebrity endorses the Death Star, it must be true, I interpret the subliminal messaging. “I” wasn’t a “really bad case”, she said. So all I needed was ten sessions at S$5,888. My eyes widened noticeably. Within half a breath, Darth Vader added that that was the usual price, but since I got to know them via their Groupon offer, I could get a promotional price of S$3,888. Nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky call this technique “anchoring and adjusting”.    MANY OPTIONS – TO PAY She added that they accepted a dazzling array of credit cards and instalment plans. I looked away towards the dark wood laminate flooring, avoiding her intent gaze. I flashed her a glance, and noticed she wasn't looking so confident any longer. Her voice, wavering almost imperceptibly, suggested I trial a session for a top-up of S$88. Sheepishly I acquiesced. I was embarrassed and wanted to avoid further embarrassment to her. She gave me a crooked smile. A rod protruded from the machine, with a suction cup on its head. She placed it on my belly where my 19-inch rims were beginning to form. It was cold to the touch and the session was shorter than a mini Thai massage. It ended, I dressed, I paid, I left. A PIPE DREAM The conclusion was clinical and business-like. Perhaps they did not entertain much optimism I might be a repeat customer. The red silhouette left by the cup remained for a few days. For every one of those days, I stood religiously before my full-length mirror, willing my eyes to detect even a miniscule of a dent in my Great Wall of Fat. On some days I seemed fitter, on other days, fatter. I seemed to myself the same after the redness disappeared. For some time after, I wondered whether I should have taken up the package. I don’t wonder anymore. I wasn’t so much being sold a couple of dates with a machine, but a pipe dream. A dream of Aristotelian physical perfection, piping superficial opiates to dull our bodily and emotional insecurities. If someone were to talk to me about this in a brightly-lit hawker centre, these concerns probably wouldn’t triggered. But entice someone into a carefully curated context and that just might happen. Did I, at any point in time, feel pressured? Definitely. But was it externally applied or self-induced? Probably both. What seems apparent to me is that the typical customer who even thinks of going through some kind of beauty treatment already feels some vulnerability. And, once he or she walks through those doors, those vulnerabilities are accentuated and made apparent. WAS THERE PRESSURE? YES AND NO We gloss over the suspicion that the clinician also wears the salesperson’s hat, invariably entangling their obligation to advise us what the best treatment plans would be, taking into account our interests, with that of raw, unadulterated commission or profit. The law says that any contract must be entered into freely. There must be no pressure or influence unduly exerted. Clearly, if I was detained for hours on end until I signed a ten-session package, or if my credit card was withheld and swiped for a four-digit sum instead of two, the law voids those transactions. If I came in for a S$38 Groupon session, and embarrassment and alarmist language convinced me into topping up S$88 for a different treatment or S$3,888 for a package, was there undue pressure? Pressure comes in many forms, and when applied, may be soft in form though hard in its reception. The pressure I certainly felt varied in both intensity and emotional response. It wasn’t so much I had lost my faculty of decision, but there was to me a significant degree of background noise interfering with my own ability to evaluate what was in my best interest. At some level of generality, what happened to me at the spa is no different than being smooth talked into plunking my pension into Profitable Plots, a scheme that promised many Singapore investors high returns buying UK land. Both, after all, deliberately arouse our base desires: Greed and vanity. What might differentiate one from the other, then? There is something to be said about inducing a person to debase his own bodily imperfections in so naked a manner as a sinner before God. If absolution could so easily be bought, who wouldn’t be tempted? In hindsight, the experience made me feel like an insect fumbling towards a Venus fly trap. I could self-flagellate and say I ought to have known better. That would indeed be true if I were perfectly rational and emotionless. But then, I wouldn't quite be human, either. I could blame the law for not protecting me from such practices. Yet I know the law’s limits mean it frequently functions reactively, mopping up the tears spilt lamenting an error already made. The fact is we all make mistakes; it’s the human condition. For some of us, it is also human to try to take advantage of that condition. My view? If something is too good to be true, it often is. Don’t take the bait. If you do, then take heed of Homer’s advice to resist the seducing calls of these spa sirens: Fill your ears to the brim with wax.

However, that changed in March when pole dancing studio Brass Barre took up 3,300 sq ft of floor space at Orchard Gateway. Now, she heads to the mall at least once a week, and finds herself lingering in the shopping centre and picking up a few items every now and then. “If the studio wasn’t there, I wouldn’t frequent that mall,” said Ms Poh, who works in public relations. Ms Poh is not alone. Droves of consumers are heading to the malls throughout the week — not primarily to shop but to attend classes, do yoga or work out in the gym. Of late, studios — teaching anything from pole dancing and pilates to cooking and crafts — as well as mega gyms, for example, have been sprouting up in shopping centres and mixed-use developments. Arcade centres, too, are seeing a revival after they had gone out of vogue. The influx of such activity-based retailers are no coincidence or a passing fad. Under siege by e-commerce, retail malls have been forced to shift their strategy to entice people to step through their doors. The Brass Barre is one of several health and fitness outfits that have been increasing their presence in Singapore’s retail landscape. In particular, mega fitness chains such as Fitness First, Virgin Active and Anytime Fitness have expanded rapidly across the island in the last few years, in developments in the Central Business District as well as suburban malls. Culinary-themed stores, such as kitchenware retailer ToTT and ABC Cooking Studio, are also popping up in various malls. In January, Timezone opened its flagship outlet at Vivocity, occupying 12,000 sq ft, and complete with bowling alleys and bumper cars. Property analysts said there is limited data on how much floor space is taken up in malls by activity-based retailers. Nevertheless, the growth of these tenants compared to, say, five years ago, is noticeable, they added. Depending on the size and location of a mall, these retailers currently take up between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of overall floor space, said Knight Frank’s head of retail Wendy Low. And it is not just the new tenants. Traditional retailers are also putting a new spin on their offerings. For example, Japanese fashion retailer Lumine, which opened in The Central in November last year, offers craft workshops in its store; active apparel wear Lululemon conducts yoga classes; and luxury brand Gucci allows customers to personalise their bags with a do-it-yourself section at its Ion Orchard store. Ms Low also cited Emporium Shokuhin in Marina Square, which has “reinvented the idea of a departmental store”. The shop has a live seafood market, a beef dry-ageing facility, a Japanese grocer and various dining concepts. It has also sought to personalise the customer experience by letting patrons pick seafood fresh out of the tank, and have a chef prepare it to their individual taste. With the myriad of offerings online, shoppers are now spoilt for choice, and doorstep deliveries have also meant there is little incentive for consumers to “take the extra step to drop by a mall”, Ms Low said. “To compete effectively, landlords need to curate a personalised experience for shoppers to attract footfall and incentivise a trip down to the mall,” she said. Ms Christine Li, senior director of research at Cushman & Wakefield, reiterated that the need for landlords to curate better shopping experiences has resulted in more activity-based retail experience at malls to “constantly engage customers”. “Craft workshops, culinary classes and fitness activities are increasingly popular with landlords as they are able to bring in regular footfalls and keep (consumers) longer in the malls as well,” she added. MALLS UNDER SIEGE Much has been said about the decline of brick-and-mortar retailers around the world, including in Singapore.   Once a famed shopping haven for Singaporeans and tourists alike, Orchard Road, for example, is now a pale shadow of itself. The Republic’s premier shopping belt is the subject of a S$1.3 million study being conducted by Australian urban planning consultancy firm Cistri. Cistri recently won the tender awarded by the Singapore Tourism Board and the Urban Redevelopment Authority to rejuvenate the 2.2km shopping belt. The six-month study began in April and a blueprint for the area — spanning the next 15 to 20 years — is expected to be unveiled later this year. While footfall is relatively high in suburban malls, which serve large residential catchment areas, retailers have bemoaned the lack of sales. Many customers, in fact, have taken to browsing at brick-and-mortar stores to check out the items before making their purchases online. As a reflection of the lacklustre retail scene, rents in the central region have fallen by 17.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year, since they peaked in the fourth quarter of 2014. Over the same period, vacancy rates have increased from 5.8 per cent to 7.3 per cent, or about 4.8 million sq ft of vacant retail space as of June.  Rents in the central region had declined for 12 consecutive quarters, before seeing a slight uptick of 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. But normal service resumed in the following quarter, as rents dipped by 1.1 per cent between April and June, based on statistics from the Urban Redevelopment Authority released on Friday. In response to the e-commerce threat, malls have turned to food and beverage (F&B) retailers to draw people back through their doors. But with the proliferation of food delivery services, developers have been forced to come up with something else. At the same time, the falling rents have opened up an opportunity for non-traditional mall retailers — which do not have high sales per square foot — to come in and set up shop.  Ms Li said that landlords used to “place more emphasis” on growing income through higher rents, “which resulted in cookie-cutter malls which are more efficient and are able to fetch higher rental”. “This has changed with the evolution of shopping,” she added. With more transactions taking place online, malls have to go beyond that and offer an experience desired by shoppers, she noted. SELLING AN EXPERIENCE In addition to strategies that malls and retailers have been employing over the last few years – such as pop-up stores and “click and collect services” – one common approach in recent times has been the creation of activity-based spaces for like-minded people to gather, experts say. For instance, the number of fitness studios in shopping centres has been on the rise. From new entrants – six-month-old Fight Zone, for instance, is already planning to open two more centres by the end of this year – to established centres, these providers have been expanding to meet demand. Launched in 2003, Fitness First now has 19 clubs, half of them in malls. Next week, it will open its 20th outlet at SingPost Centre in Paya Lebar, occupying 12,000 sq ft of floor space. Anytime Fitness, which offers 24/7 gym access, has been expanding aggressively since opening in 2013. Its 50th outlet will open at the end of September. Each gym has about 1,000 members, said its marketing associate Alicia Ng. That translates to a total of about 50,000 active customers. Fitness club Virgin Active has grown from its first centre at One Raffles Place in 2013 to five gyms, situated mainly in mixed-use developments and shopping malls. Its total floor area has more than tripled to 109,000 sq ft in five years. Its Southeast Asia managing director Christian Mason said membership has more than doubled after it opened four clubs in the last two years. As of June, Virgin Active has close to 10,000 members. He added that Virgin Active has invested up to S$100 million to open at least eight clubs by 2022.  While fitness centres grow from strength to strength, gaming centres are making a comeback at shopping malls as part of the push by developers to offer activity-based retail experiences. Once a fixture in Singapore’s malls, Timezone — an international chain of family amusement arcade centres — saw a slowdown in its business in the early 2000s due to the popularity of in-home gaming options, said its chief customer officer Caroline Leong. But business has picked up significantly of late. Since April last year, Timezone has opened five new outlets, doubling its total number across the island. The latest is its 11,800 sq ft flagship gaming centre in Vivo City. A new outlet will open in Jurong Point at the end of August. There are now over 2 million active customers across all its outlets, a 5 per cent increase over last year, said Ms Leong. Amid the push by landlords to offer an activity-based retail experience, the introduction of high-tech gaming options, for example, has also led to renewed interest in arcade centres in general. Zero Latency, which opened in November last year, uses virtual reality to bring gamers into a zombie world. Wearing a headset, gamers are able to roam freely in a 2,100 sq ft space. The store has seen over 15,000 customers since launch. Mr Simon Ogilvie, executive director of Tomorrow Entertainment which brought in Zero Latency from Australia, said there is a rise in commercial-grade entertainment centres as there are limitations to what in-home game consoles can do. “Experience-based tenants are valuable for malls,” he noted. Meanwhile, culinary-themed retailers are also making strides in shopping malls. Beyond its retail services, Kitchenware store Tott — which started out in Bukit Timah six years ago — offers cooking classes for the public and for corporate team bonding activities. It has two outlets now, both of which are at shopping malls — Suntec City and Century Square. Its director Grace Tan said there has been a 32 per cent increase in its membership base from 2016 to date. “Besides the convenience and accessibility of shopping malls for our customers, we also appreciate the shopping mall marketing teams who work closely with their tenants to drive traffic,” she said. ABC Cooking Studio, which opened in Takashimaya three years ago, is opening another outlet in Westgate next month. The school has close to 10,000 members. The number of students it sees each month has increased from 2,000 in the first year, to 5,000. The firm’s regional marketing manager Karen Chong said:  We see an increasing trend where consumers are actively seeking hands-on activities to gain some experience. … ABC is offering experiences such as face-to-face interaction and the learning of new skills that cannot be replaced by the Internet and social media. Keen to tap on the growing interest in such experience-based activities, do-it-yourself baking studio Funsiamo will open in August. Rather than requiring customers to book baking slots, Funsiamo allows customers to walk in anytime to the 1,200 sq ft studio and learn how to bake from recipes provided on iPads, said master franchisee Desmond Ling, who brought in the concept from Taiwan. Ms Li, from Cushman & Wakefield, noted that some retailers are also using social media to build a more intimate relationship with customers and improve their shopping experience. Others are also tapping on augmented or virtual reality, she added. Homegrown furniture store Commune, for example, recently introduced VR and 3D-planning services at its retail store, so that shoppers can visualise how the furniture and furnishings look in their homes. Automation is also another trend hitting the retail scene, with more automated vending machines being seen in shopping malls in recent months, Ms Li said. ‘NOT ENOUGH’ TO TURN THE TIDE Some consumers were divided over whether the malls are doing enough to draw them back. Mr Darryl Lim, 28, said the proliferation of activity-based retailers changes the experience of window shopping. “You don’t just walk, but (get to) try new things,” he said. Ms Nurul Syuhuda, 20, said she was running out of ideas about what she can do with family and friends for leisure, and the hands-on activities could help her bond with her loved ones. “Window shopping is boring,” she added. However, Ms Koh Xiu Ming, 24, did not think such activities would entice her to make more trips to the malls, adding that they do not make “much of a difference”. Ms Daphne Lim, 36, said that while she enjoys craft workshops and welcomes such activities being offered, they were not compelling enough to make her frequent the malls. The experts believe that Singapore’s shopping centres need to do a lot more to transform the retail scene, which is lagging behind places such as Hong Kong, some cities in China and Dubai. For example, Dubai Square, which opened last week, features fashion stores with smart fitting rooms that come with interactive mirrors and personalised recommendations using artificial intelligence.  Shoppers can order food and drinks from eateries using apps, saving them the need to queue and wait. Via the apps, they can also buy items from the stores — which are described as “showrooms” — and collect them later. Ernst & Young consumer products and retail leader Chandan Joshi described the Singapore malls’ current game plan of changing their tenant mix as “small, incremental steps”, which have prevented footfalls from declining and stabilised occupancy rates. But with a significant supply of new retail space coming onstream in the next two to three years, he warned that the sector has to innovate more to stop occupancy rates from falling. “We are not going as far to innovate on the experiential side … We’re not at the cutting-edge of this experience, rather we’re just followers,” he said. “Truly innovative, revolutionary retail is almost missing in Singapore.” There is also the question of how sustainable the current strategy is, experts said. While rentals are expected to stay low as the retail scene tries to get back on its feet, higher rents could make business untenable for activity-based retailers, which do not generate high sales on a per square foot basis.   Nevertheless, experts noted that this would depend on a few factors such as how innovative the affected concept stores are, whether they are smaller retailers or large global brands with deep pockets, as well as the negotiations between landlords and tenants. Experts also reiterated that there are several obstacles hindering the transformation of the retail sector here, including the payments infrastructure. Said Ms Li:  In Singapore because of payment issues, and malls having different loyalty programmes, people have been slow to embark on the journey (of transformation) … Over the next one or two years, the priority is for Singapore to get onto one single payment platform. While on the decline, the rentals in malls are still relatively high. And this limits the scope for retailers to experiment with novel concepts, Ms Li added.  Mr Chandan felt that the need to revolutionise the retail scene has not hit home, because retailers and landlords are not desperate yet. “To some extent because of the weather and the location, there is almost a compulsive need to go to a mall … There are not many other places to go to (in Singapore), so the families still end up in the malls anyway,” he added. But he stressed:  A mindset shift is needed… (retailers and landlords) should view retail disruption as an opportunity rather than as a threat.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/e-commerce-malls-gaming-arcades-fitness-studios-retail-singapore-10574068"}, {"datetime": "31 Jul 2018 02:16AM", "tags": [], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "A little help goes a long way to enable special-needs workers", "content": " SINGAPORE: The world of Marc Chiang became blurry seven years ago after he was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease which causes his vision to worsen over time. Back then, he was working as a facilities engineer at Keppel Data Centres. His job was to oversee maintenance work at the data centres. “It was pretty hazardous because there was live electrical equipment which you cannot just touch,” Chiang, 38, recalled. When he found out about his condition, he hesitated to inform his supervisor as the company was in a transitional period. But when he eventually told his supervisor she responded “very negatively”, he said. “She actually told me, ‘I don’t know what else you can do’,” said Chiang.   He is one of more than 12,000 workers - or about 0.55 per cent of the resident workforce - with special needs, according to the Ministry of Social and Family Development.  For Chiang, he was fortunate that his general manager then, Chng Hak Kiat (who is now the Chief Operating Officer), decided to create a new role that would leverage his experience in running data centres. Chiang said this gave him “a new lease of life” as he battled depression. “When the job was settled then I could do other things. I couldn’t be doing sports. I couldn’t be having a lifestyle. I couldn’t be going for holidays. I couldn’t be doing anything if I’m not working and earning a living. So it’s not just a job that he has given me,” Chiang said. TECHNOLOGY HELPS, BUT ONLY SOME DO From there, Chiang picked himself up and devoted himself to the work of a process architect, where he is required to read pages and pages of documents put forth by other departments in Keppel Data Centres. He reviews their work processes and consults with them to improve their workflow. In his new role, he has been given the freedom to work from home or in office as he sees fit. He has set up an office by a window in his brightly-lit 3.5-bedroom HDB flat in Clementi. His workstation includes a second monitor which “any other person would need”, as well as free text magnifier add-ons that come with the computer programmes he uses for work, like Adobe Reader.  “There are certain software that are good-to-have but I don’t really need to install anything else,” he said. He also has a handheld device that allows him to magnify any physical documents as well as his iPhone, which scans documents and reads it out to him. Even with technological help, there are still gaps in his work processes that require the cooperation of his colleagues. For instance, his colleagues are advised to send him documents in Word format instead of a PDF copy to suit his assistive programmes. There were also times when technology worked against him. Once, at a new data centre, Chiang was faced with an access control system with touchscreens. What made it worse was it had a digital number pad which had scrambled numbers for added security. “I told a general manager and my immediate supervisor. We looked at it and asked, ‘Is there a need for the jumbled up characters?’ In the end we didn’t change the touchscreen but unscrambled the numbers,” Chiang said. This experience also highlighted to Chiang’s supervisor the importance of being inclusive and the feedback that can come from diverse hires within the organisation. AN ENABLING WORKPLACE CULTURE Like Chiang, 25-year-old Ong Hua Han counts his lucky stars for finding an enabling employer such as Deutsche Bank, through SG Enable. The government-established agency's programmes include working with employers to provide suitable internship opportunities for students with disabilities. When he was studying at the National University of Singapore, Ong, who has brittle bone disease, did a 10-week internship with Deutsche Bank that was specifically catered to undergraduates with disabilities. He subsequently joined the German bank after he graduated. The bank has a diversity programme to include people with disabilities. Bernd Starke, who chairs the programme, said the bank has taken on board two interns with disabilities as full-time staff. Ong’s colleague, who is also a wheelchair user like him, required automated doors for her to get around the office. Starke said the bank has not been required to make many changes to accommodate them, while the cost to make the office more accessible is \"not an issue\".  The bank is putting its attention on creating a fairer work environment, such as by training hiring managers to guard against unconscious biases during the hiring process, said Starke. “They’re really focusing on hiring the skill sets that matter, and the person (who will) contribute positively to the business. When they are convinced, they will do the necessary investments,” said Starke. While Ong has heard of instances where employers discriminate people with disabilities, he has personally never experienced it. “If I meet such an employer, I will end the application and move on. I personally have no interest in working for an employer like that. It’s unattractive to me and I believe it’s their loss,” he said. His assessment of the employer starts right from the beginning, during the job hunt. For instance, he would inform the hiring manager that he uses a wheelchair and ask if there would be stairs to climb. Potential employers would always respond positively to his question, he added. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT Even though the Government and non-profit agencies have made the effort to promote fair employment practices, a report by the Disabled People’s Association and Institute of Policy Studies in July showed that some still experience a disability pay gap. On a similar note, a 2015 Singapore Management University study said the salaries of people with disabilities tended to be “quite low” and could not be depended on to provide for their needs. “Employment is all about merit. So if the job requires you to move an object from A to B but you can only move it from A to A and a half, then it’s okay to be paid less and I walk into it knowing that I can only be half-paid. But the more controversial one would be we both did the same thing and I get paid less. That’s not the same thing,” Ong said. Jane Lim, a 40-year-old engineer with a hearing impairment, had a positive experience before starting at her first job. As a fresh polytechnic graduate, she had checked published salary guidelines and knew how much she should expect to be paid. “I actually wrote down that the salary be less than the guideline. But my boss told me, ‘No, you cannot put this down. I believe in your ability so you should put the salary (which) is the same as the salary guideline’. He believed in my abilities and not my disability,” she said. While Starke believes that the disabled community is a talent pool that needs to be looked at by every industry, \"especially those that are strapped of manpower\", he cautioned against looking at them as a cheap source of human capital. “I do understand that smaller companies probably have more concerns about the ability to pay,” he said. “Here in Singapore, there are a couple of programmes that provide support and they help to overcome these concerns.  “But in the long run, if you focus on abilities and you are convinced this is the person who can do the job, then you should pay them fairly.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/a-little-help-goes-a-long-way-to-enable-special-needs-workers-10574546"}, {"datetime": "30 Jul 2018 11:57PM", "tags": ["U.S.", "business", "China", "Indo-Pacific", "energy", "Pompeo"], "author": "", "title": "Pompeo announces US$113m in new US initiatives in 'Indo-Pacific'", "content": " WASHINGTON: Building on President Donald Trump's \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday (Jul 30) announced US$113 million in new regional investments focused on technology, energy and infrastructure. The announcement comes at a time when trade frictions with China have given US trade diplomacy a sharper edge. A senior US official said the investments were not aimed at countering China's Belt and Road Initiative, which consists of mostly state-led infrastructure projects linking Asia, parts of Africa and Europe. \"These funds represent just a down payment on a new era in US economic commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,\" Pompeo said a speech to the US Chamber of Commerce. He said he would visit Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia this week, where he would also announce new security assistance in the region. Pompeo said the United States \"will oppose any country\" which seeks to dominate the region in what appeared to be a reference to Beijing amid heightened tensions in the South China Sea. \"Like so many of our Asian allies and friends, our country fought for its own independence from an empire that expected deference,\" Pompeo said. \"We thus have never and will never seek domination in the Indo-Pacific, and we will oppose any country that does,\" he added. Countries in the region have been worried by Trump's \"America first\" policy, withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, and pursuit of a trade conflict with China that threatens to disrupt regional supply chains. The United States first outlined its strategy to develop the Indo-Pacific economy at an Asia-Pacific summit last year. \"Indo-Pacific\" has become known in diplomatic circles as shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of \"Asia-Pacific,\" which from some perspectives had authoritarian China too firmly at its centre. Among the new investments outlined by Pompeo, the United States will invest US$25 million to expand US technology exports to the region, add nearly US$50 million this year to help countries produce and store their energy resources, and create a new assistance network to boost infrastructure development. CHINA'S WAY, US WAY Speaking to reporters ahead of the speech, Brian Hook, senior policy adviser to Pompeo, said the United States was not competing with China's mostly state-led infrastructure initiatives. \"It is a made-in-China, made-for-China initiative,\" Hook told reporters on a conference call. \"Our way of doing things is to keep the government's role very modest and it's focused on helping businesses do what they do best.\" Critics of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to recreate the ancient Silk Road, say it is more about spreading Chinese influence and hooking countries on massive debts. Beijing says it is simply a development project that any country is welcome to join. Hook said Washington \"welcomed\" Chinese contributions to regional development, but said it wanted China to adhere to international standards on transparency, the rule of law and sustainable financing. \"We know that America's model of economic engagement is the healthiest for nations in the region. It's high-quality, it's transparent and it is financially sustainable,\" Hook said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/pompeo-announces-us-113m-in-new-us-initiatives-in-indo-pacific-10575098"}, {"datetime": "30 Jul 2018 10:42PM", "tags": ["JB-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link"], "author": "", "title": "Working paper on JB-Singapore RTS link to be tabled to Cabinet soon: Malaysia transport minister", "content": " JOHOR BAHRU: A working paper on the Rapid Transit System (RTS) project linking Johor Bahru to Woodlands, Singapore, will be presented to the Cabinet soon, said Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke on Monday (Jul 30). He said that although the government had agreed in principle to the implementation of the RTS project, detailed information about it is still needed to be brought to the Cabinet for approval. “The government remains committed to implement the RTS project … in terms of cost, the Cabinet approval is needed,” he told reporters on Monday (Jul 30). Loke said once the approval was received from the Cabinet, a joint venture company between Malaysia and Singapore would be set up to ensure the smooth implementation of the project. His comments came after his Singapore counterpart Khaw Boon Wan said earlier this month that Singapore’s SMRT Corporation and Malaysia’s Prasarana Malaysia missed a deadline to set up a joint venture company to become the operator of the RTS. But Loke said on Monday that the project would still be completed on schedule despite a \"slight delay\" due to a change of government after the 14th General Election (GE14). “There was a delay of one, two months after GE14 but we hope it can be implemented as planned,\" he said, adding that Singapore had already been informed of the delay. \"We also need to remember that Malaysia is not alone in this matter, our (rail) system also needs to be integrated with Singapore’s,” said Loke. Despite the delay, he said the federal government would not have to pay any compensation to Singapore. “The issue does not arise because we have not signed the agreement yet, only involves an MoU (memorandum of understanding) that demonstrates our commitment, so there is no compensation,” he said.

As the victim had previously told her aunt that she was interested in modelling, she did not suspect that it was someone else contacting her, and so sent Rostam the photos. Rostam did not stop here. Still posing as the aunt, he told the victim that he was going to die soon and wanted to watch her touching herself. The victim duly sent a video of her touching herself to him. Eventually, the victim discovered that it was not her aunt who had been messaging her. She then made a police report. HE HAD TWO METHODS OF ACCESSING SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS Rostam was the first person to be charged under provision 8B of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, for obtaining passwords to commit offences. He faced 46 charges, with another 117 charges taken into consideration. Rostam sought nude photos from his victims by saying he represented a modelling agency, or claiming that he was running a breast cancer screening campaign. He had two methods of accessing the social media accounts. The first was by exploiting a vulnerability in Facebook accounts that use hotmail email addresses as login credentials. If a hotmail user does not use his email account for 270 days or does not log into the account within 10 days of signing up for the account, the hotmail account is deactivated and terminated. This means that the hotmail user ID can be selected by another user and registered as a new account. Rostam searched for Facebook accounts that used hotmail IDs as their Facebook login credentials. He then checked with hotmail.com whether the account still existed. If the account had been terminated, he would register for an account using the user ID he had obtained. Once the account was registered, he would use the reset password function which would send an email to his new hotmail account, and gain control over the Facebook account. The second method involved the use of phishing links to obtain a Facebook user's login credentials. Rostam learnt how to create phishing links from a YouTube video and used phishing websites to send those links to Facebook users. These links invite victims to view photographs or take part in activities like personality quizzes on the condition that they must key in their Facebook login incredentials. After gaining their login credentials, Rostam would send messages to the friends linked to those accounts, asking for photos of their breasts. Some of them made police reports after becoming suspicious. ACCUSED DIAGNOSED WITH FETISHISM, REOFFENDED WHILE OUT ON BAIL Rostam was sentenced to jail for three years and five months on Monday, along with a fine of S$5,000. District Judge Jasvender Kaur noted a 2016 report by the Institute of Mental Health, which indicated that Rostam was diagnosed with fetishism. However, she said that he still had \"full control\" over his actions. She said that the offence was serious, with a large number of victims as well as detailed planning and premeditation. There was also a serious invasion of privacy, and Rostam had continued offending after being charged in December 2017.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nightclub-bouncer-tricked-women-send-nude-photos-on-facebook-10574440"}, {"datetime": "30 Jul 2018 05:59PM", "tags": ["Institute of Policy Studies", "NUS"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Singaporeans see virtues like compassion in themselves but view society as complaining: Survey", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore society is kiasu (Hokkien for afraid to lose), kiasi (Hokkien for overly afraid or timid) and complaining, according to respondents of a survey, but they see themselves as having virtues like humour, compassion and honesty.  The disconnect between personal descriptions and their perceptions of society was one the findings of the 2018 Singapore National Values Assessment revealed on Monday (Jul 30) by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and consulting firm Aadvantage.   Public policy researcher Dr Gillian Koh, who facilitated a roundtable discussion on the survey findings on Monday, questioned what it is about stepping out of the door that creates the disconnect. “Some of the rules, some of the Government policies, some of how life is structured make it difficult for you to take your personal values, which you love, which you exercise at home out into society,” she said. She asked if there are purposes to the societal norm or Government policies that create such attributes in society which should be tweaked. The survey, which was also conducted in 2012 and 2015, sought to find out what Singaporeans consider to be the values, beliefs and behaviours that best describe them at a personal level, their perceptions of Singapore society and their vision of the ideal society. While the view of society as being kiasu, kiasi and materialistic was also brought up by respondents in the previous surveys, “complaining”, which was a new word included in this year's survey, also featured among the top 10 qualities seen in today's society. Positive values such as educational opportunities and effective healthcare also feature in what people see in the current society. WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT The respondents defined their ideal society as one where there are educational opportunities, care for the elderly as well as the disadvantaged and effective healthcare. Other attributes of an ideal society included caring for the environment, respect and dependable public services. Quality of life and employment opportunities which were picked in 2012 and 2015, fell off the list this year. “While basic needs will always be important, it is heartening the survey provides evidence that Singaporeans do want our society to be defined by higher order values like compassion and respect,” said Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser from the department of sociology at the National University of Singapore. Affordable housing emerged the most frequently mentioned quality in an ideal society, and remained a constant in the three survey findings. It was also viewed as an attribute that had the biggest lag between the current situation and what is desired in the future. Almost half of the 2,000 respondents were also polled on values they desired of their workplaces. Employee recognition came up as the attribute that required the most work. There were 360 votes on employee recognition as a desired value. Employee recognition had also been flagged in the previous two surveys. The national values assessment survey was mainly conducted face-to-face between March and May this year using a sample that represents Singapore society according to gender, age, ethnicity and housing type. The survey was conducted jointly by aAdvantage Consulting Group and Barrett Values Centre.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singaporeans-see-virtues-like-compassion-in-themselves-but-view-10574428"}, {"datetime": "30 Jul 2018 05:33PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "ASEAN", "Saifuddin Abdullah", "Vivian Balakrishnan"], "author": "", "title": "Vivian Balakrishnan 'confident' of working closely with Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said he was \"confident\" that he and his Malaysian counterpart, Saifuddin Abdullah, will be able to \"work closely together\".  Mr Saifuddin is in Singapore from Monday to Tuesday for an introductory visit.  In a Facebook post on Monday (Jul 30), Dr Balakrishnan said during his meeting with Mr Saifuddin, they \"took stock of the wide-ranging cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia\" and \"exchanged ideas on new opportunities to work on together\". \"I also took the opportunity to also welcome Dato' Saifuddin to the ASEAN circuit,\" added Dr Balakrishnan, who also hosted Mr Saifuddin and his wife, Norlin Shamsul Bahri, to a lunch.

The 26-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order, had committed the first offence on Nov 25, 2015. At about 5am that day, he heard someone showering in the female toilet at NUS' Eusoff Hall and entered the toilet to peep at the person, court documents said. He went into a cubicle next to the victim and locked the door, before climbing up a partition and peeping at the woman, who was naked. But the woman realised someone was watching her and she quickly left the toilet to seek her friends' help. When they returned, with a campus security officer, the peeping tom was still in the locked cubicle. He surrendered himself to the officer, who called the police. The student was given a conditional warning over this incident in February 2017, but just a few months later, he molested another woman. THEY WERE WORKING THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR FINAL YEAR PROJECTS The second victim was working on her final year project at a computer lab at around 7pm on Apr 19 last year. She was with her boyfriend in the lab, where the accused was also working on his final year project. They stayed overnight at the lab, and the victim's boyfriend fell asleep there at about 2am, while the victim went to sleep about two hours later. At about 6am, the accused woke up and saw the victim sleeping while he was on his way to the washroom. He walked towards her, placed his hand through the opening of her shorts and molested her. The victim woke up at the touch and the accused quickly walked away from her. She then told her boyfriend what had happened.  Together, they confronted the accused, who apologised. The victim informed NUS authorities and lodged a police report. The man pleaded guilty on Monday to one charge of assault or use of criminal force with intent to outrage modesty and one charge of making a gesture intending to insult the modesty of a woman. Another charge was taken into consideration for sentencing.  ACCUSED DIAGNOSED WITH VOYEURISM, FETISHISM According to the defence, the accused was diagnosed with voyeurism and fetishism by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), a condition he has had since he was in primary school. \"He has a desire of cross-dressing and likes to act like a woman. He also likes to collect discarded female clothing,\" said defence lawyer Jason Lim. District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim said: \"There's no need for him to walk into the female shower, right?\" The defence said the accused has previously gone into the female toilet to shower, and would change into female clothes before walking around dressed as a woman. \"The peeping was very brief,\" Mr Lim said. \"There was also no skin-to-skin contact. It was committed during the spur of the moment. There was no premeditation, and he did not try to flee or deny that he had committed the offences.\" He added that his client had a strong propensity for reform and has followed up with IMH doctors on his own volition. He asked the judge to consider giving him a probation order, failing which, he asked for a jail term of eight months and a fine. Deputy Public Prosecutor Mark Yeo asked for a sentence of nine months' jail and three strokes of the cane, saying that there was a need for general and specific deterrence. The judge agreed with the prosecution and sentenced the man to nine months' jail and three strokes of the cane, saying that his reoffending so quickly was an aggravating factor she could not ignore. For assault or use of criminal force with intent to outrage modesty, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties. For insulting the modesty of a woman, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined. The accused has been suspended from school, NUS said on Monday.  \"The university takes a serious view of any misconduct by our students,\" a spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia. \"The student concerned is currently serving a candidature suspension, during which he is mandated to seek psychiatric treatment.  \"Security measures are also in place to protect the safety and well-being of our students on our campuses.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nus-student-molested-classmate-peeped-at-woman-in-shower-10574260"}, {"datetime": "30 Jul 2018 04:22PM", "tags": ["SMRT", "public transport"], "author": "", "title": "Some bus services to run later in view of early MRT station closure in August, September", "content": " SINGAPORE: The operational hours of five SBS Transit bus services will be extended on certain days in August and September.

Yet industry executives aren't betting on a return to the glory days anytime soon. The industry, along with a top-class finance sector, has been a key pillar of Singapore's economic transformation into a first world economy since independence from British colonial rule in 1965 and a source of national pride. But a 2014 collapse in oil prices has resulted in thousands of jobs lost, several defaults and billions of dollars in debt restructurings. Now, as oil prices pick up, the industry is coming back to life. A 28.3 per cent year-on-year jump in output from the marine and offshore engineering sector in June was the biggest since March 2014. However, Singapore's battered companies are bracing for a long period of convalescence. The specialist divers and engineers servicing rigs in Southeast Asian waters have moved on and may be unwilling to return for lower wages. Bankers, having been bitten by the sector, are reluctant to lend. And oil prices have recovered almost too quickly for oil exploration and production clients to have the confidence to turn enquiries into actual orders. \"While we may be at the bottom of the cycle, we view the recovery as more gradual with risk of most new order wins being low or zero-margin jobs,\" said Ajay Mirchandani, head of research for ASEAN at JP Morgan. \"We won't be anywhere near the glory days for the foreseeable future.\" Take Kim Heng Offshore and Marine Holdings, a firm which provides rig services and owns shipyards. During the downturn, it slashed its workforce by a third, cut salaries by 10 to 20 per cent, and sold around seven barges. As oil prices recovered, it has gone into distressed sales and bought several vessels used for towing and anchoring rigs, for as little as US$3.2 million apiece, about 10 per cent of their usual price. It plans to own 15 of them, hoping for help from private equity investors. But this is investment for the future and ploughing more funds into the sector is reliant on how oil prices fare. Oil prices need to sustain their recovery into next year to boost client sentiment, CEO Thomas Tan told Reuters. \"Eventually the increase in oil prices will give (companies) enough money to reinvest in the future, which may happen probably next year,\" he said. \"They are slowly increasing their investment but not in a big way. Demand is still pretty slow.\" Growth in Singapore's trade-reliant economy had slowed in the wake of the oil price crash. It has since recovered as output in sectors like electronics surged, though economists say the city-state faces growing headwinds from a bitter U.S.-China trade dispute. DWINDLING CONTRIBUTION The offshore and marine engineering industry's direct output contribution has more than halved since 2014 to about 1 per cent of the city-state's economy, but its significance extends beyond manufacturing: Real estate has been pressured as companies needed less office space and fewer workers needed housing. Well-paid engineers have stopped browsing the shopping malls. And executives doubt they can bring them all back. \"During this whole crisis ... we lost quite a lot of this talent to other industries, so to build it up again will take some time,\" said Sean Lee, chief executive of Marco Polo Marine , which owns offshore support vessels, tugs and barges and recently finished restructuring its debt after getting \"almost zero\" enquiries in the previous two years. \"It is going to be difficult to attract new people or even bring back those who have left,\" he said. Even sector heavyweights Keppel Corp and Sembcorp Marine said recently they were not hopeful of any quick recovery. \"While overall sentiment and offshore capex spend have begun to improve, it will take some time before sustained new orders occur,\" Wong Weng Sun, Sembcorp Marine's chief executive, said at its results briefing this month.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-offshore-industry-recovering-but-no-return-to-glory-10573770"}, {"datetime": "30 Jul 2018 11:25AM", "tags": ["Stefanie Sun"], "author": "", "title": "Stefanie Sun gives birth to second child ", "content": " SINGAPORE: It's a special birthday for Singaporean singer Stefanie Sun, who gave birth to her second child just two days after celebrating her 40th birthday.  Sun announced on Facebook on Monday (Jul 30) that she gave birth last Wednesday at Thomson Medical Centre.

We are seeing superstars in soccer, professional cycling, baseball, rugby and other sports performing at the highest level into their late 30s and even 40s. Sports personalities like Francesco Totti (retired at 40) and Ryan Giggs (retired at 41) Tom Brady (41, NFL), Sylvain Chavanel (39, Tour de France cyclist), Jaromir Jagr (46, NHL ice hockey), and Tim Duncan (retired at 42, NBA) excelled for roughly a decade longer than used to be the case. THE LONGEVITY DIVIDEND Why is this happening? They focus on more than just athletic skills. They eat better. They take care of themselves. They rehabilitate their bodies, get excellent medical care, and prepare mentally. As a result, they are able to reap extraordinary benefits for longer. Due to their ability and experience, older athletes provide tremendous value to their teams and huge joy to fans. They prove that outdated ideas about age and performance no longer hold true. We, too, can excel for longer and it’s called the longevity dividend. Not everyone can be compared to top athletes, but there are undeniable breakthroughs in neuroscience, nutrition and adult development that enable healthy adults to extend the age-range for impactful contribution. However, organisations rarely utilise the science-based insights — and toss-away an amazing competitive advantage.  The resource and opportunity that older workers represent is being overlooked at a time when our workforce is shrinking. LOOK BEYOND RESKILLING By 2030, Singapore may see a talent deficit exceeding 1 million positions according to consultancy firm Korn Ferry, with a total unrealised output of S$106.8 billion.  Add to that concerns about people living a 100-year life, cost of healthcare, and insufficient retirement savings. The challenges associated with living longer are substantial. Singapore’s response to its ageing workforce has revolved largely around skills development. Reskilling programmes teach marketable skills to older workers. These efforts are critical at a time when an ageing workforce must also confront technology and automation that displaces workers. Reskilling, however, is necessary but insufficient to support an ageing workforce. While we are upgrading skills, life’s natural process of cognitive decline is already underway. Starting in our 40s, research shows that people naturally experience a decline in reasoning, memory, spatial visualisation and processing speed.  The implication for Singapore is that we are asking an ageing workforce to use new skills without first addressing cognitive decline. UNLOCKING NEW MINDSETS  Fortunately, cognitive neuroscience reveals how to help executives and leaders to get in shape mentally, delay natural ageing and even enhance cognitive performance of the body and mind. Studies conducted at research institutions including the Centre for BrainHealth (CBH) at the University of Texas at Dallas demonstrates that cognitive training over a few months in healthy older adults can enhance the brain’s executive functions, improve innovative cognition and produce faster brain processing speeds. Cognitive performance in older adults can be enhanced. Furthermore, science demonstrates that we develop a unique mindset and capabilities that become available only as we age. In the later stages of adult development, exemplified by figures like Nelson Mandela, Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, Narendra Modi or Angela Merkel, older and more experienced leaders bring a more mature mindset capable of operating at a higher plane of complexity. Leadership researcher Keith Eigel studied executives at this highest level of adult development and found that their mature mindset correlates positively with business effectiveness. Cognitive development programmes complement and support reskilling by enhancing the mental capabilities these newly-learned skills depend upon. A careful individual repositioning can further enhance an improved mental agility and a mature leadership strategy. Again, think of it in terms of the sports metaphor. Why do older star athletes often score the most important goals and points in the game? Certainly not because they are faster or more aggressive than anyone else. They score because they are smarter. They can read the game better. They know their assets and weaknesses. While on the pitch, they can at that very moment imagine themselves as sitting in the 35th row of the arena where they have a perfect vantage point.  Investing in an ageing workforce can deliver these same types of benefits to organisations. RESPOSITIONING ORGANISATIONS That is what the Longevity Dividend is about in a nutshell. Organisational leaders who develop next-step cognitive abilities will know where the ball will be in a couple of moments and they will be there, too, waiting for the opportunity. The repositioning is everything. Sometimes it may mean delegating more, pushing the workload forcefully downwards while positioning themselves more as a coach and mentor. At other times it means facilitating the talent of others at a decisive, value-creating moment. The individual repositioning would not be enough without important changes in culture and organisation. We need to help different generations work together and the early research on multi-generational teams is promising. Compared to more generationally homogenous teams, early research shows that the age-diverse teams deliver better decisions.  Such benefits are only achieved if all employees dispatch with the ageism and recognise the different cognitive resources that everyone brings.  Only then can we fulfil the promise of the longevity dividend and fully realise the emerging wisdom that today’s 72 is yesterday’s 58.

After all, he was the only close family member she had left. Furthermore Mdm Tan, a fall risk living in a rental flat, had lost all independence due to her limited mobility and weak legs. \"Our care management team knew of her suicidal thoughts,\" senior social worker at Tsao Foundation's Hua Mei Mobile Clinic Jasmine Wong told Channel NewsAsia. So, staff from the organisation's counselling and coaching team provided her with psycho-emotional counselling and therapy, and worked with neighbours and community partners to support her daily living. With Mdm Tan refusing to go to a nursing home, the staff made frequent visits to \"reassure her that life has more to offer\". They continued to care for her for another year or so, until she died from cancer. But there are others who fall through the cracks. The number of elderly aged 60 and above who took their own lives peaked at 129 last year, the highest since suicide tracking started in 1991, the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) said in a release on Monday (Jul 30). This is six cases more than 2016, when 123 elderly suicides were reported. The proportion of elderly suicides has also gone up: Seniors made up 36 per cent of 361 suicides reported in 2017, compared to 29 per cent of 429 suicides the year before. “It is very worrying that many elderly are turning to suicide as the only choice to end their pain and struggles, when they should be enjoying the lustre of their golden years,” SOS executive director Christine Wong said. According to National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser, the typical profile of a senior who is more likely to commit suicide is probably someone aged 75 or above, living alone or with a spouse, and has only up to primary school education. FEAR OF BEING A BURDEN, SOCIAL DISCONNECTION AMONG REASONS These seniors might feel that life is \"empty and meaningless\", Dr Tan told Channel NewsAsia, stating the absence of social support or a chronic or terminal illness as some common reasons for suicide. Other common struggles include social disconnection, the fear of burdening family and friends, and daily difficulties due to physical challenges and deteriorating mental health, SOS said, citing callers to their 24-hour hotline. \"These concerns predisposes socially isolated elderly to depression and suicidal thoughts when struggles go undetected and unaddressed,\" it added. However, SOS said fewer seniors are calling in. Last year, 5,652 calls were made by the elderly, an 18 per cent drop from the 6,904 calls in 2016. This is particularly worrying given the current trend, SOS said, especially as the hotline is \"favoured by the older demographic group\". Of those who disclosed their age, 23 per cent of calls made to the SOS last year were by seniors aged 60 and above. Dr Tan explained that some might choose not to call in as they are not used to the idea of sharing their \"innermost thoughts with others or seeking help through a hotline to speak to a stranger\".  \"They are also thinking that no one could understand them and their situation, let alone help them,\" he said. What's worse is some of them might not even be aware of other forms of help. \"They are probably living in isolation, have few or no friends, know only people who are just as ignorant about other forms of help, or do not see non-kin as a possible source of help,\" Dr Tan added. And when this happens, SOS said the elderly might feel a \"strong sense of helplessness which may exacerbate social isolation\". Nevertheless, Dr Tan said alternative assistance can come in the form of family members who are \"caring, supportive and attentive\". Volunteers who meet the elderly regularly, are seen as friends, and can link them up with trained counsellors who can provide professional help are also beneficial, he added. To that end, SOS stressed the \"imminent need for stronger support networks as the number of elderly Singapore residents living alone continues to increase\", pointing out that this will bring about challenges to current social support services. THE RED FLAGS Mr Simon-Peter Lum, deputy head of COMNET Senior Services under AMKFSC Community Services, said staff are trained to look out for suicidal tendencies by attending courses conducted by SOS and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), and through case conferences and case sharing sessions. Symptoms of suicidal tendencies include making preparations for death, like writing a will or giving away cherished belongings, enquiring about a sudden change in environment, and a sudden withdrawal from social interactions. Tsao Foundation's Ms Wong said red flags include physical complaints like \"wa long cong tia\", Hokkien for \"I'm feeling pain everywhere\", and self-neglect in terms of low personal hygiene and a dirty living environment. Staff should also pay extra attention to elderly who are struggling with a recent life crisis, like the death of a loved one or excessive medical bills. In one real-life case, a senior who had experienced hallucinations approached a COMNET worker and requested depression screening. \"The senior was found to be at high risk of suicide and staff members accompanied him to IMH with his consent,\" Mr Lum said. After the senior was treated and discharged, social workers, Senior Activity Centre (SAC) staff and those with the Community Resource, Engagement and Support Team continued to monitor him through home visits and his participation at the SAC. For low-risk cases, staff provide counselling and emotional support, help them look at the positives in life, and recognise their stressors and how to manage them. \"We also develop a safety plan with them and continue to monitor and follow-up until they stabilise,\" Mr Lum added. \"We will also refer the cases to social workers where appropriate.\" WHAT YOU CAN DO Mr Lum encouraged family members, caregivers and volunteers to communicate with their seniors and take note of character changes and suicide symptoms for early detection. \"Convey concern and allow them to express what is troubling them, empathise and support them and let them know they are not alone,\" he said. \"Helping them to identify stressors provides a sense of relief, sharing their burden increases their ability and confidence to cope.\" Besides that, he added, keeping them engaged in meaningful activities will help give them purpose. \"Sometimes, expressions of suicidal thoughts can be signs of the elders crying for help,\" Tsao Foundation's Ms Wong said. \"It’s not advisable to brush the elders aside for having ‘silly, idle thoughts’ – which may well be red flags for suicide risk.\" Taking a senior to see a good and trusted general practitioner (GP) over the years can also help identify signs of depression, social isolation and calls for help, she said. \"Indirect clues that a GP will have opportunity to identify would include repeat visits by an elder for loss of appetite and weight loss, inability to sleep and refusal to take medicine,\" she added. \"GPs can also help to refer relevant cases to counsellors and other community partners.\" OVERALL SUICIDES LOWEST SINCE 2012 Meanwhile, the overall number of suicides reported last year – at 361 – was the lowest since 2012. This means that the average suicide rate dropped to 7.74 deaths by suicide per 100,000 residents, compared to 9.14 deaths from 2012 to 2016. “For the past years, our community outreach education and engagements targeted mainly youths and adults who are technologically savvy as these efforts were concentrated on various social media platforms,” SOS' Ms Wong said. “The drop in deaths by suicide in these age groups may be attributed to the concerted efforts of all social service partners and many others in the community, even members of the public who are aware of SOS suicide prevention work.”  Despite that, Ms Wong said the community and an individual's social support groups should continue to step up efforts and not let go \"thinking that a slight decrease makes a difference on suicide prevention and awareness among the youths\". SOS said: \"Beyond just being a reporting figure, the annual suicide statistics also reveal the reality of struggles faced by ordinary Singaporeans.\" Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

Speaking to media on the sidelines of the Team Singapore Flag Presentation Ceremony for the Asian Games, Asian Para Games and the Youth Olympic Games, Ms Fu expressed confidence that the Asian Games athletes will do Singapore proud as “they have been training very hard” and that the Government will support them in whatever way it can.  In response to a question over expectations on the team, Ms Fu said: “We don’t have any specific targets but I’m sure each of the sports will go out and really do their very best for Singapore.” Singapore is set to field its largest Asian Games contingent of 265 athletes across 21 sports at the tournament in Indonesia, which will take place on Aug 18 until Sep 2.  At the official flag presentation ceremony, gymnast Hoe Wah Toon was unveiled as the flag bearer for the Asian Games squad.  Chef de Mission for Team Singapore at the Asian Games, Mr Lee Wung Yew, outlined to members of the media that the three sports renowned for delivering medals at the tournament are sailing, bowling and swimming.  However Mr Lee, who is a former national shooter who represented Singapore six times at the Asian Games and thrice at the Olympic Games, added that supporters can expect “nice surprises” in other sports, including in events that Singapore will be competing in for the first time.  Sports that will be debuting for Singapore at the Games include contract bridge, synchronised swimming, ju jit-su and paragliding.  At the previous edition of the Asian Games in Incheon in 2014, Team Singapore’s 223-strong contingent clinched five golds, six silvers and 14 bronze medals.  At the official flag presentation ceremony on Sunday, archer Nur Syahidah Alim and table tennis player Koen Pang were unveiled as flag bearers for the Singapore contingent at the Asian Para Games and the Youth Olympic Games respectively.  In October, a total of 44 Singapore para athletes will be competing across 10 sports in the Asian Para Games at Indonesia in while 15 youth athletes will be representing the country from eight sports at Argentina. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-specific-target-for-team-singapore-athletes-at-asian-games-10572082"}, {"datetime": "29 Jul 2018 06:23AM", "tags": ["Sports", "Asian Games"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'Is this useful for going to casinos?' The Singapore team bidding for success at the Asian Games", "content": " SINGAPORE: Loo Choon Chou, a member of the Singapore team for the upcoming Asian Games, trains hard for competitions. However, his preparations don't include the type of activities one normally associates with major sporting events, like hitting the gym or careful diet planning. Instead, the 36-year-old spends hours analysing future opponents and pores over a playbook, familiarising himself with possible scenarios he might encounter at the games, which are being held in Indonesia next month. As D-Day looms, Mr Loo also often checks into a hotel with the rest of his team, where they fall into a pre-competition routine. Their schedule revolves around group walks and lots and lots of practice. This unusual training regime is because Mr Loo's event requires mental rather than physical exertion: Contract Bridge. He and his teammates are working hard to ensure that when match day comes around and Mr Loo dons his jersey, he is ready for battle - one he will fight with a hand of 13 cards. A full-time player with a club based out of China's Zhejiang province, Mr Loo is also one of the 266 competitors representing Singapore at the Asian Games in Indonesia next month - 24 of which are part of the bridge squad. \"Most people don't even know what bridge is,\" he told Channel NewsAsia. \"The funniest question is when some ask: 'Is this useful for going to casinos? Can you make a lot of money there (with these skills)?' Sadly, the answer is no.\"  Contract bridge, or bridge as it is commonly known, is a game played using a 52-card deck by four players in two competing partnerships.   The game begins with the bidding phase, where each player attempts to relay information about their hand to their respective partners, by bidding to win the 'contract'.  A bid consists of a number and a suit - spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs, or no trump. The pair that win the bidding auction will attempt to earn the required number of 'tricks' (a sets of four cards) to meet the contract.   Points are then scored based on the number of tricks won with respect to opponents. Between 40 to 60 rounds, or 'boards', are usually played per day in a tournament. \"If I were to sum up bridge, it would be decision-making under conditions of uncertainty,\" said Mr Kenneth Chan, secretary of Singapore Contract Bridge Association (SCBA).  \"For every board, you have to take into account the risks - like what are the potential things you can lose and the potential gains that you can get. So it's all about risk analysis.\" There are close to 1,000 active contract bridge players in Singapore, estimates Mr Chan, who noted that many pick it up from clubs at the junior college or university level.  This year marks the first time contract bridge will be included at the Asian Games. The sport featured at the 2011 SEA Games, also in Indonesia, where Singapore finished with one gold medal, five silvers and three bronzes. Mdm Seet Choon Cheng clinched gold in the women's pairs event in Palembang, and seven years later, will once again be representing Singapore. \"It was a really good feeling then because the Indonesians were thinking that they would get the gold. They didn't and so they were a little disappointed,\" recalled Mdm Seet, who will be competing in the Super Mixed event with her husband Mr Chua Gang. Sitting at a table playing cards may seem straightforward, but Mdm Seet says that hours of contract bridge can take a toll on players. \"It's like after taking an 'A' level exam. It can be so tiring that you blank out while playing,\" she said. \"(When I play bridge) I always tell my friends and colleagues that I am going for the other type of stress.\" Mr Loo, who participates in close to ten professional tournaments a year agrees. His competitions can last up to ten days, with eight hours played per day, he said. \"There's a lot of endurance and stamina required and at the end of the day it's about who makes the least mistakes. It's not about how brilliant or good you are,\" he explained. The former Hwa Chong Institution Mathematics teacher also makes it a point to keep fit as part of his regular routine, and exercises thrice a week. \"I find that it does help in the ability to concentrate,\" he added. UNITED WE STAND Having a good contract bridge partner is also essential to a team's success, say members of the Singapore squad. \"Bridge is not just an intellectual game, there is also a social aspect to it. You have to learn how to communicate with your partner and learn how he thinks, so that in a typical scenario, you can read each other well and that gives you an edge,\" said Mr Loo, whose full-time bridge partner is Mr Poon Hua.  The pair quit their jobs to turn pro as a team in 2014. \"A good partner is very important. One of the older players told me that a good partner is like a good marriage. You have to be on the same wavelength to be able to communicate well through the bidding,\" added Mr Chan, an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. Another couple who will represent Singapore at the Asian Games are Mr Fong Kien Hoong and Mdm Tan Sock Hgin. The pair met at the bridge club in university and have been married for 14 years. \"If your spouse too plays bridge, they will understand the demands of the game, why I have to spend so much time reading notes, writing notes and playing,\" said Mr Fong, who has forked out more than S$20,000 participating in bridge competitions overseas.  Ultimately, the group aim to raise the profile of the sport in Singapore with a solid showing at the Asian Games.  The general consensus is that they could be among the medals along with traditional powerhouses Indonesia, China and Japan. \"The men's team I think we have a pretty good chance,\" noted Mr Fong.  \"I think a bronze is a pretty high probability, and we are trying for a silver and if we are in luck, we might even get a gold.\" On Aug 27, 2018, Singapore's contract bridge men's team won the gold medal in the event's debut at the Asian Games. ​​​​​​​Read the full story here.

Her dedication saw her recently appointed President of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), a role she takes on formally on Aug 1.  From the get-go in our conversation she concedes that she is among the privileged few who can afford to volunteer full-time as she doesn't have financial constraints that others do.  But she also reveals that, in a way, she has been part of the sector since she was born. It’s a story she says she doesn’t tell very often and it’s related to the fact that she is an adopted child, something her mother disclosed to her when she was four years old. “It’s so important to tell your kids that they are adopted,” says Ms Fam.  “If they find out one day in a way they never expected to, it could be the most devastating thing. They need to be told that they were intentionally sought out and wanted by their adoptive parents. Then, one feels special because you’re being chosen as opposed to in another situation, where they might think about it in terms of having been given up by their biological parent.” To listen to the full interview, click here. Recently, she found her birth certificate among her parents’ belongings and it revealed more information about her birth mother. “She was single and 19 years old at the time. The birth certificate said ‘Care of: The Salvation Army’ which is an organisation in the social service sector. I was sharing this with a fellow board member in NCSS and he was the one who said, ‘Wah, do you realise you’ve come one full circle? You started your life in the social service sector.’ \"It seems divinely planned that I’ve come back into this area to give back.” I ask if she ever felt like seeking out her birth mother. Her normally self-assured and positive voice softens as she tells me she would “rather not”. “If you think about it, if she was single then, she probably didn’t want many people to know about it. She might be a grandmother or a great-grandmother now with her own family and the last thing she’d want is someone to come out of the blue and bring out something that she might have kept a secret all her life. I wouldn’t want to spoil someone’s life or disturb it. “I look back now and I think that’s so brave of her to have gone through something like this at 19 and in the early 60s.” Her adoptive parents’ love also assured her enough not to go seeking parental love elsewhere.  A POWERFUL TRANSITION She might have had her roots in the social services sector but her conscious involvement in it came much later in life. In her mid-thirties, she decided to take a career break from the legal sector to look after her one-year-old daughter. A phone call from activist, Leaena Tambyah of the Asian Women’s Welfare Association (AWWA), an organisation for which Ms Fam had previously done pro bono legal work, changed everything. Ms Tambyah, who was instrumental in setting up a playgroup for children with disabilities, which eventually grew to become the AWWA School, asked Ms Fam to be vice-chair of a mobile therapy service called Therapy and Education for Children in Mainstream Education (TEACH ME). This provided assistance to children whose parents could not afford the money or the time for therapy sessions in hospitals. “I think she just saw me as someone who was young and had some free time on her hands,” says Ms Fam laughingly. She is quick to add that the experience was a powerful one. “AWWA provided multiple services in areas of eldercare, family, disability, special education and with every single area, the financing is different, the programming is different, so I was able to get a far better understanding of the intricacies of the funding and programming in these various areas.” This led to her sitting on numerous boards over the years and spoken up passionately about society’s needs. THE SHAME OF MENTAL ILLNESS – “I FELT AS IF I WOULD EXPLODE” One of the areas she is particularly concerned with is mental health and the stigma associated with mental illnesses. Her own parents have, at various stages of their lives, been afflicted by depression and anxiety disorders. “My first encounter with depression was when I was 18 years old and my dad slipped into a very deep clinical depression. In those days, no one talked about it.” Her father, Michael Fam, was a prominent figure in Singapore society having been chairman of the Housing and Development Board, then chairman of the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation. At that stage, he had retired and the emptiness of having no vocation was too difficult for him to handle.  “I remember my mum coming into my room and telling me not to tell a soul. She told me I was not to tell even my brother. It was a very frightening thing because I was studying for my ‘A’ levels and there was no one I could turn to. My dad used to spend a lot of time with me. He used to come into my room, sit on my bed and weep. I had to bottle this up when I was 18. I felt as if I would explode, it was awful.” Later that year, she couldn’t handle it by herself and wrote to her brother who was studying abroad at the time. She told him what was going on. Her father eventually sought help and counselling and medication helped him overcome his depression within six months.  “I would never have talked about this while he was alive because he would have felt the stigma, but when my father passed away in 2014, I felt by sharing it I would help others.” Today, she hopes more would share while they are going through or recovering from such difficulties. \"We need to talk about these things more openly and realise that there’s nothing taboo about it. The problem is, sometimes there are negative consequences. There’s so much stigma attached to it that if someone knew that you’ve had a history of mental illness, they don’t want to employ you. We need to change that. Just because you’ve had a history of it, doesn’t mean that it’s going to affect your performance in the workplace.” To help do this, NCSS has been working on a peer support scheme for persons in recovery. “These are persons with lived experiences. They’ve actually been down the road where they’ve had mental health challenges and they’ve come out of it and they can be mentors to others in the workplace. So it helps the employers to understand because these peers can actually explain to their employers what the journey would look like and they can be a mentor for the person who’s come back into the workforce.” Her mother too suffered from mental health issues - an anxiety disorder for most of her life and, towards the end, Alzheimer’s disease. “I was her main caregiver. I organised everything in her life – her doctors’ visits, her activities.” She was fortunate enough to have assistance. She hired a helper and her husband and children also played a part in “adding normality” to her mother’s life. “You are dealing with a person whom you don’t know anymore. The elements are so different. There are no more filters and it’s an entirely different person. The advice given to me by a very dear friend who had walked on that road, a few steps ahead of me, was to enter their world. Don’t fight it. It’s their reality. Don’t try and add logic or try and say, ‘No it’s daytime’ when they think it’s night-time. “So when she’d ask me where her mom and dad were, I wouldn’t say they died a long time ago. I’d just say that they are not here. She also used to think that I was her sister, Joyce.” Ms Fam would embrace that role because it made her mother happy. IMPROVING ASSISTANCE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT The experience taught her that those who need care in whichever area – whether financial, social or healthcare assistance – need to be helped more. “I was fortunate enough to have the ability to get help, to have the means to hire a helper for instance. For others, it may be harder. They need access to information and resources, not only for the ones whom they love, but for themselves. We need to have a one stop portal or stop for information and people to help them navigate the terrain and to know how they can help with services or with the financial aspects.” She says that the situation has improved today with more Social Service Offices under the Ministry of Social and Family Development being set up island-wide.  But she also admits that more can be done within the social services sector to ensure that such outreach is done more effectively. One of the keys is having competent manpower. “This is a big role that I see NCSS playing in equipping organisations so that they can manage manpower and volunteers more effectively. So it’s helping organizations with expertise in training. They also need volunteer managers and we need to train them. We need to help them with systems.” Investing in such initiatives has helped at least one of the organisations she chairs, the Assisi Hospice. MANPOWER, FAIR PAY AND VOLUNTEERS Another issue tied to manpower is salaries. Salaries across the board in the social services sector need to be “fair”, she says. I put it to her that some feel those working for such organisations should be doing it out of a sense of mission rather than for financial gain and there is often a concern that those at the top are paid excessively large salaries.  I ask her how she would define “fair” in this context. “I would say market rates, private sector market rates or just a little bit below. I personally am blessed to be in that situation where I can be a full-time volunteer but many people have to have jobs to look after their families to support themselves and if you pay them very little, how are they going to live? And if the private sector is much more attractive, why would competent, qualified people come here? “If you have good quality people who are far more effective in the way they design their programmes, their service deliveries which are far more appropriate to the beneficiaries, you probably can do things in a shorter period of time, more efficiently.  It’s actually a cost-benefit approach that we are looking at.\"  The  principle should be applied to personnel at all levels within social service organisations, she says.  However, she concedes that competence and salaries have to be accompanied by heart. “Those who don’t have heart won’t stay long anyway, because it can be very emotionally draining work. The CEOs of such organisations especially need to be very in touch with the ground and have the heart for it if they are to lead successfully.” She also urges more to enter the sector as volunteers. “I was just looking at some recent stats and now one in three Singaporeans actually volunteer. I’d say that even if you gave one or two days a year, it’s something. You might not be able to volunteer regularly, but you can volunteer sporadically. But I think especially with the millennials now, actually they are far more altruistic. They really want to do good and it is reflected in even their choice of jobs, because they actually want to go into jobs where there is some sort of social good. So I don’t think things are bleak.” For all this to work, money to keep organisations going and to fund programmes is vital and she advocates more sustainable funding methods. “In the US, the majority of funders now like to fund endowments. The whole concept of an endowment fund is that you preserve the capital and you spend the interest, so there is sustainability in the funding. So I may contribute an amount to the endowment fund but then I know the legacy of my capital injection will last 20 years or in perpetuity and it provides certainty to the people who use it.\" The social services sector is also looking to facilitate greater collaboration and boost service delivery with two new digital initiatives. The first is an IT system to improve back-end processes.  Jointly developed by NCSS and Singapore Pools, iShine Cloud provides a suite of integrated IT cloud services which includes office productivity tools, shared storage, human resources and accounting packages, which voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) can enjoy at subsidised rates. The second initiative is the Social Service Navigator, an interactive online platform and mobile portal that consolidates information on social service providers, programmes and resources all over Singapore to help social service professionals find the resources they need to support their daily work. CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO MORE? While the sector continues to evolve, I ask if she feels the Government can do more to help those who don't have the means to access social services.  While she believes there have been tremendous improvements in this area in the last decade, she says more can be done to help more people access financial assistance and subsidies by recalibrating the eligibility criteria, especially for those in the lower-middle income group. “When it comes to means-testing for instance. I used to call it 'mean' testing. It was very mean. I think it’s been carefully calibrated to a degree now that I feel it’s slightly less mean for certain families, but my personal opinion is we can be a little bit more generous in how we determine that, so maybe that’s something that Government may think about in time to come.” “I WAS SELF-ABSORBED. I’M ASHAMED” As we approach the end of our conversation, she tells me that her involvement in the social service sector has changed her tremendously. She remembers what she was like before. “I guess in those days when you were working, what do you want? You want to earn a lot of money. I was a junior partner in a law firm, I didn’t think of anyone except for myself and it didn’t seem wrong to do so. I wasn’t harming anyone. I was basically having a good time. I was self-absorbed. It never occurred to me that there were folks around me who weren’t living the sort of life that I was living. “I’m ashamed when I look back. Especially when I was in university, I didn’t realise that my fellow classmates were having such a hard time. Some of my classmates in law school had to hold two jobs while studying. I was going to the beach, watching movies. Can you imagine someone slogging his butt off and seeing these other spoilt kids who are just driving around, being able to go to a restaurant and eat without having to count their dollars?” What she is doing today may not fully make up for the past, but she is intent on “making a difference”. “If I’m able to shape a program or service that allows more people to have a better life, especially in the area of disability or mental health or caregiving or end-of-life care, I’ll die happy.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/anita-fam-ncss-national-council-of-social-service-10566894"}, {"datetime": "29 Jul 2018 06:23AM", "tags": ["charity", "inequality", "poverty", "social enterprise"], "author": "Melissa Kwee", "title": "Commentary: Can the rich be caring?", "content": " SINGAPORE: Growing up, my late grandfather was pivotal in shaping my world views. A successful businessman, he was honoured by the Emperor of Japan and the President of the United States for his philanthropy. He believed strongly in the dignity of all. Despite his wealth, he lived in a modest three-bedroom house for most of his life and would chat with the homeless on the streets. People may forget his consumer electronics and dinnerware businesses, but they will remember his generosity which shaped the city of Los Angeles, and in particular, the Japanese-American community. Later on, I attended an elite school which offered scholarships to students from developing countries as part of its vision to promote international understanding. We were proud to have talented youth, who embody our school values, be part of the community. My siblings and I lived comfortable lives. But we had role models – family members, mentors and school leaders – who taught us we were no better or worse than anyone else. We learnt the value of being other-centred. Rather than being served, we were encouraged to use our gifts to serve others. AN EMPATHY GAP The issue of inequality has generated lively debate in recent months. A question that arises from the debate is whether the rich can be caring. The bigger question is whether the privileged, through poor exposure, suffer from an empathy gap and how can we close this to build a more inclusive society. NVPC research suggests the well-heeled do serve society. The volunteerism rate among Singapore's private housing residents is 55.6 per cent, above the national average of 35 per cent, according to our 2016 Individual Giving Survey. Yet there is a sense that well-off Singaporeans still hold indifferent and uncaring attitudes toward the poor. My grandfather's example shows that anyone – rich or poor – can nurture empathy. Compassion is what makes us human. But how often do we exercise this quality? Our middle and upper classes have multiple options in life, from where they choose to stay, where their kids go to school to what kind of healthcare they want. But with the privilege of choice comes the risk of ignorance. Some options effectively reduce exposure to society's needs and opportunities to build compassion for others. It was only when my mother was in the intensive care at Singapore General Hospital when she had her stroke did we experience life with other families who camped out in the halls and waiting rooms for weeks and even months. We got to know them, share, cry and pray with them.  With money, it is easy to live private and routinised lives. Today, with social media algorithms exposing us to similar people and viewpoints, we further risk becoming narrow-minded without realising it. MINDSETS OF SCARCITY This sounds surprising, but the rich are often very poor: Poor in spirit and satisfaction, and rich in worry. Wealth provides choices but doesn’t always bring happiness. A poverty of spirit comes when we view everything with a half-empty lens and nothing is ever enough or good enough. In a 2016 parliamentary speech, Nominated Member of Parliament Kuik Shiao Yin described how Singapore has a national habit of \"scarcity thinking\". We have been conditioned to think that resources are scarce in our little red dot, and there is little to go around. Money no enough, time no enough, space no enough, what to do? When we believe that there isn't enough, the tendency isn't to help but to hoard.  Scarcity thinking is when we think that giving more away means less for us. It shows when we compare and complain of what we do not have, forgetting to give thanks for what we do. Without gratitude, we are truly poor no matter what our financial assets. PIONEERS AND LEADERS TODAY Policies can change the rules by which we live, such as by encouraging mixing in housing estates. But ultimately, society shifts when values shift.   I believe a shared value of other-centredness will keep us strong and together. To do this, we need to enlarge our definition of success to include helping and serving others. We have rich examples in Singapore's history to draw from - especially businessmen-philanthropists like Tan Kah Kee, Govindasamy Pillai and Tan Tock Seng who stepped up as community leaders and advocated on behalf of others. Our clan associations promoted mutual aid across class borders, believing that everyone should be treated as family. But beyond these visible examples are many invisible heroes who lived out the spirit of mutual care and common cause; the gotong royong, kampong spirit, as some call it. I see a resurgence of this in society. Stewardship Asia advocates a spirit of stewardship to public and private companies and family businesses. Honour Singapore champions honour as what has made, and can continue to make, Singapore successful. The Singapore Kindness Movement reminds us greatness is in the power of a kind and gentle spirit. These efforts build lasting values that complement those of economic progress and achievement.  At NVPC, we believe volunteering can build bridges between people and foster empathy.  Volunteering is not the strong helping the weak, but a chance for everyone to offer something of themselves, knowing life is not an even playing field. We need humility, a learning mindset and a chance to rediscover or relearn.  In my early days as a mentor, I remember being irritated by a girl for constantly being late for our Saturday morning session. I later discovered she worked two jobs and only came home at 4am. Meeting me at 10am took effort. I was ignorant and I needed to ask to understand.  Years later, that girl is now a breadwinner and top salesperson at her company. My journey with her made me rethink ill-informed assumptions, such as \"Some people don't work hard enough\" or \"You just can't help everyone.\" Through giving, I received new wisdom. It is no wonder that NVPC's Individual Giving Survey shows that giving begets more giving. 80 per cent of current volunteers are likely to serve again compared to those who have never volunteered before (21 per cent), and they donate more than five times that of non-volunteers.  We gain something from helping others – a sense of fulfilment, a different perspective, a fresh motivation in life; leading to a virtuous circle. BUILDING TRUE RESILIENCE We tend to underestimate our ability to give and what strengths we have. In an NVPC quarterly survey of 1,053 Singapore residents this March, 69 per cent agreed that \"individuals like themselves\" played a major role in giving to society. This was the lowest score, compared to the role we felt the Government (84 per cent), non-profit organisations (80 per cent) and corporations (77 per cent) played. Is it that Singaporeans think they don't have enough to contribute – the scarcity mindset at play? Or is it a sense that others should take responsibility before us? In either case, we must build a truly resilient society for all of us, to combat scarcity-mindedness and to focus on the gifts we do have and what is needed. What is needed is often not complicated. We assume that the poor just need money but sometimes what people truly need is a friend, a defender to stand up for them, or a second chance when things go wrong. Anyone can offer these, which just might be more valuable than money. If we look beyond the obvious, we may find we already have something of value. Our car can give a lift to someone in need. Our bilingual skills can help a senior navigate a largely English-language system. Our retirement hours can be used to mentor and befriend someone, or tend a beautiful community garden. The same applies to organisations that have or do something. How can we share this? I am Vice Chairman at Crest Secondary School, a Normal Technical specialised school in Jurong. We are not an elite school but have a great sports facility. So we share it with the community, in the spirit of being a good neighbour. Rich or poor, we all have something to give. The more we reach out, the more we will break down barriers, and build an empathetic and truly resilient society that cares for one another.

Once she is done, Tai Chi Ah Ma – as she is known to other residents – gets down on her haunches and starts on her other daily routine: Weeding the rooftop garden, where countless herbs, edibles and ornamental plants grow in profusion. “These plants keep the air fresh. The air downstairs isn’t so good,” she said, scrabbling at the soil. Fellow volunteer Lim Kiat Kee has been growing herbs there for over seven years. The 75-year-old has a nickname too: Bus Ah Ma, on account of being a former bus driver. They live in the same block, on different floors – but it was in the garden where their friendship blossomed, and where many other bonds between neighbours were forged. A unique signboard captures the open-hearted spirit that flourishes here. \"Pick our herbs and spices for free,\" it invites everyone, even those who did none of the gardening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In community gardens elsewhere, fears of abuse have commonly led to locked fences and turf wars. But here at Dover Crescent, there is a special kampung spirit at work. It needed one resident, however, to turn what was once a humdrum patch of green – so uninspiring that Tai Chi Ah Ma used to exercise on the ground floor – into something much more. That man was Mr Benjamin Ee, and he has been guided by a simple philosophy since he became gardener number one: “You can’t call it a community garden if it doesn’t bring people together.” CHOOSING TO BE GENEROUS Mr Ee, who recently retired from his job as project manager in the construction industry, has always loved gardening. But this personal pet project in his estate is his first stab at a community garden. And he has chosen not to be territorial. “Because we’re growing different types of plants, invariably we’d have people coming to ask us, ‘Can I have this? Can I have that?’ And I say, let’s be generous,” said the 60-year-old. “Whatever we can afford to give, let’s give it to them because we want to engage the community.” He does not mind that some people want the produce without putting in the hard work, as he wants to “make this garden a bit different”. What tends to be a sore point among green fingers in Singapore – the damage done to pots and plants, the pilfering and the littering – does not seem to faze him either. “People have deliberately broken the branches, stolen the whole plant, taken the pots or broken them, taken some of the slabs and thrown them around,” he admitted. “There are people who smoke and leave the cigarette butts here, and beer cans – not here on the paved area but on the garden ground. So we have to be gracious about those things.” Such incidents have not detracted from his concept of an open garden, one where students come to study, foreign workers sit to have their meals and other residents have other reasons to be drawn to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “We’ve had people come here in the mornings to read their papers and someone reading the bible. I had a lady one evening who came here crying, to be by herself, and she asked me for some advice,” he recounted. I’ve had neighbours from other precincts, even the condominium nearby, coming to ask for some of the edible flowers, giving them seeds. I’ve had people on wheelchairs looking around, so I gave them the water hose to spray (the plants). “We have people, this afternoon actually, coming to discuss some serious matter. I saw the seriousness on their faces,\" he added. APPROACHED OUT OF THE BLUE In its original state, however, the roof garden consisted of common cow grass, some palm trees, a few lime trees, a bunch of pandan shrubs, “and there was no shelter – it was just that”. “A lot of residents said they came up here, looked at it and then went off. There was nothing to interact with,” said Mr Ee, who estimated that there are now over 80 species of plants, spices and medicinal herbs. He may have never got involved in the garden, however, if not for another resident approaching him out of the blue. It was December 2010, and he was having breakfast with his family at the coffee shop, with a potted plant they had bought on their table, when an elderly lady spotted him. She had been looking for people interested in gardening, and she decided to ask him whether he would be willing to start a proper garden for the residents. After he gave it some thought, it made perfect sense. Their estate was new, one that had just replaced several blocks at Dover Road that were chosen for the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme. Some residents would be feeling displaced, so it would be good to start something to bring them together, he reasoned. And the name given to their estate could scarcely have been lost on him. “When I first moved here, I saw the sign. It said we’re called Dover Gardens. But a garden needs to be something exciting,” he said, adding that “it was about time”, too, for him to give back to the community. By the next month, he had rounded up a committee of seven, and they held their first meeting in his 40th-storey flat over coffee, biscuits and cake to start planning and preparing budgets. Having approached the town council, via the Dover Crescent Residents’ Committee, he was then given the go-ahead in April 2011. They broke ground a month later on the new garden: Three plots totalling more than 200 square metres. “To me, it was like, ‘Wow. This is more than I could've expected,’” he said. NO PROPER FUNDING While the garden may have come a long way since then, the journey has had its share of ups and downs, some unexpected. At the outset, for example, Mr Ee’s team had to get the garden going without any funds given to them. So one thing he did was to source for materials that could be recycled or upcycled, such as paving stones, which he secured from his contacts in the construction industry. These were surplus stones that contractors would have had to pay to dispose of, so he paid their workers instead to bring them to the garden, where his team laid every slab. “Even this bench I’m sitting on is recycled by taking a number of broken benches and putting them together, and you get one that’s still useable,” he told CNA Insider. An initial investment was still needed, however, so his team pooled S$700. “Then as the garden developed, other neighbours heard about it and started putting in money,” he said. “When we were growing vegetables, they’d come, take their vegetables and say, ‘Okay, I'd like to give you a contribution of S$100.' I’d say S$2 is good enough, but they’d give S$100 or S$10.” There were also those who gave in kind, including plants, seeds and fertiliser. One resident, for example, gave him some Indian lemon seeds to plant. “She said that she’d tried for over a year but couldn’t grow any. Then I took the seeds and grew them. She said, “Woah, you’re blessed, your hands are blessed.’ I was like, ‘No, it’s nature,’” he recounted. He estimated his own contribution over the years at S$1,000 at most. MANPOWER WOES Money, in the end, was not the biggest challenge. Manpower was, including managing the small team he had. When Mr Ee was focusing on developing a flowering garden at one of the three plots, problems emerged among the committee members to whom he had handed over the vegetable garden. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “There were some relationship strains that caused some major challenges. That affected the garden, and I was often called to be the middleman, which wasn’t what I wanted to do,” he said. The once-thriving vegetable plot, which produced almost 175 kilogrammes of harvest monthly, fell into disrepair. So in 2013, he turned it into a pallet garden for flowers, which meant less maintenance. Despite such struggles, the roof garden won an Environmental and Biodiversity Award from the National Parks Board the next year, and with it a cash award of S$1,000. That was when Mr Ee suffered one of the biggest blows. To use the money, his committee had to join the Dover Crescent RC. But the other members objected, as the RC had not given them funding in the first place. They quit, leaving him to join the RC alone in the hope that he could engage more residents. “It was very disheartening at times. There were times I was thinking, ‘Yeah, maybe I should give up,’” admitted Mr Ee, who was still working full-time then. I was beginning to put in more and more time, and my wife would say, ‘Hey, what’s going on? You don’t have the manpower, and you’re taking so much time out of the family.’ But the plants were not in good health, and some residents even texted him to ask what was going on with the garden. “I was like, ‘Okay, this is a heavy weight on my shoulder,’” he recalled. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For a period, he would water the garden at 6.30am because of the manpower shortage and have one of his few volunteers do it on another day. Yet, he did not blame people for not volunteering. “Most Singaporeans generally find it quite tough working under the sun. And then sometimes you get insects buzzing around. It can be quite uncomfortable,” he said. “I think that’s the reason they’re not so keen on gardening. But they generally like the garden.” AT THE WIFE'S SUGGESTION Mr Ee still had people encouraging him – people like Tai Chi Ah Ma and Bus Ah Ma, who was one of his original volunteers and who would brew herbs from the garden for him. And then others joined to pick up the slack, like Mr Rahman Latiff, who loved the garden and volunteered to do the watering and cleaning while learning about Chinese herbs and doing some planting. Pushing 80, he is at the garden at least four times a week. The turning point came early last year when Mr Ee’s wife suggested that he open up half the garden for people to take whatever is grown, and also suggested some of the possible plants. They have not looked back since, and neither have the residents. There is Siti the domestic helper, who comes thrice a week for pandan leaves, to make a barley drink for her employer’s family. There is Amy the 56-year-old, who discovered that the garden was a great place to practise tai chi, and picks one or two lime leaves too. And there is a lot more they can take, but only if needed: Sweet potato leaves, lemongrass, Kaffir lime, brinjal, ladies' fingers, chilli, Thai basil, garlic, ginger, and so on. Throughout its several transformations, the garden has gone from strength to strength, picking up eight awards, including the Gardeners’ Cup 2018 this past week at the ongoing Singapore Garden Festival. Its open concept even came to the attention of Temasek, which decided \"in the spirit of sustainability\" to donate edible herbs and plants exhibited at last month’s Temasek Ecosperity Conference to the garden. There are now over 1,000 community gardens under NParks’ Community In Bloom initiative. A minority of them are roof gardens. But Mr Ee hopes that what he and his team are doing is extra special. And he wants to do more, like the activities held in the garden previously when he had more manpower – for example, barbecue nights and Christmas under the stars – “so that we can build that community”. As he noted emphatically, “The garden is all about relationships. It’s not just about plants.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/benjamin-ee-edible-community-garden-dover-crescent-open-concept-10570964"}, {"datetime": "28 Jul 2018 11:31PM", "tags": ["Arsenal", "Mesut Ozil", "Paris Saint Germain"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "Football: Ozil delights Singapore fans, fires Arsenal to 5-1 win over PSG", "content": " SINGAPORE: His fancy flicks were greeted by a palpable buzz of excitement and his opening goal for Arsenal on Saturday night (Jul 28) was met with a roar of approval from fans at the Singapore National Stadium.  Mesut Ozil more than entertained the 50,300-strong crowd, including Singapore's Olympic champion Joseph Schooling, as the English Premier League side thrashed French champions Paris Saint Germain (PSG) 5-1 in the International Champions Cup. A early goal from the German got the Gunners up and running, before PSG struck back with a spot kick from Christopher Nkunku. A late Alexandre Lacazette double then sealed the win for Unai Emery’s men, before a Rob Holding header and an Eddie Nketiah finish put a gloss on proceedings. Mired in a racism row which led him to announce his retirement from the international game, Ozil had been the name on football fans' lips since Arsenal’s arrival in Singapore.  An unused substitute for the Gunners’ penalty shootout loss to Atletico Madrid on Thursday, the playmaker took to the field against PSG as captain - this time he was one of the headline acts rather than part of the supporting cast. It was PSG that started the game the brighter of the two sides, Thomas Tuchel’s men were menacing in possession, with the livewire Timothy Weah causing problems. It took more than 10 minutes for Arsenal to find their footing - Ozil whipping in a tantalising cross which was met by Shkodran Mustafi’s flick-on, but Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang was a stretch away from tapping home. Unai Emery’s men took the lead in the 13th minute. A sublime through ball from Henrik Mkhitaryan found Aubameyang in acres of space, and his cross was tucked home by Ozil to raucous cheers from the crowd. PSG weren’t the only ones taken to task by Ozil. Singaporean referee Nathan Chan was lustily booed several minutes after failing to award a penalty when Ozil seemed to be tugged back in the box. Arsenal were knocking on the door, and a smart flick from Ozil found Mkhitaryan, whose pass played in Alex Iwobi. But the Nigerian could only prod a shot at Gianluigi Buffon. PSG could have easily found their equaliser moments later, as a flamboyant Ozil dummy on the edge of the box failed to materialise and Bernd Leno had to adjust to bail his skipper out with a smart stop. Arsenal looked like they had their foot off the gas after the half-time break and they were punished as PSG were awarded with a penalty. Beating his marker for pace, Weah’s probing run into the box was halted by a crude tackle from Sead Kolasinac. Up stepped youngster Nkunku, who smashed the spot kick past Leno. The Gunners weren’t behind for long, as substitute Emile Smith Rowe - on for Ozil - picked out Lacazette and the Frenchman finished neatly off the underside of the crossbar. Arsenal made it three in the 71st minute - as Lacazette bundled home from close range after a goalmouth melee.  A looping header by Holding was the nail in the coffin for PSG, as the young defender scored Arsenal’s fourth a few minutes from time. Substitute Nketiah added insult to injury with Arsenal’s fifth in stoppage time.  The Gunners will now return home with a massive confidence boost and the added assurance that the enigmatic Ozil is capable of not just doing his talking off the pitch, but could be back to his best on it.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-ozil-delights-singapore-fans-fires-arsenal-to-5-1-win-10571264"}, {"datetime": "28 Jul 2018 10:41PM", "tags": ["Boon Lay MRT station", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Police searching for man who threatened to blow up pawn shop outside Boon Lay MRT station", "content": " SINGAPORE: Police are searching for a man who threatened to blow up a pawn shop outside Boon Lay MRT station on Saturday afternoon (Jul 28) after a failed attempt to rob it.  The man entered the pawn shop at about 4.30pm, said the police.  Armed with a knife and a gun that is believed to be a replica, the man demanded that an employee hand over cash and jewellery.  When the employee refused, the man allegedly said he would blow up the shop, claiming he had an explosive device.  \"The man then threw the said object on the counter and fled the pawnshop without taking any items.

The moon travels to a similar position every month, but the tilt of its orbit means it normally passes above or below the Earth's shadow - so most months we have a full moon without an eclipse.  When the three celestial bodies are perfectly lined up, however, the Earth's atmosphere scatters blue light from the sun while refracting or bending red light onto the moon, usually giving it a rosy blush. As the moon goes dark over Singapore, I am reminded:\"As far as we can discern the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.\" Carl Jung. pic.twitter.com/M9uTRHvQ8z  Unfortunately for those who missed Saturday's eclipse, the next lunar eclipse of such a length will only happen in 2123.

And while necessary to protect our feet, they also leave a significant impact on the earth we tread on.   A typical pair of running shoes is responsible for about 13.6kg of carbon dioxide emissions in its lifetime – the equivalent of keeping a 100-watt light bulb on for a week, one 2013 study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found. Then there is the issue of waste. While there are no footwear-specific figures, National Environment Agency statistics indicate that 141,200 tonnes of textile and leather waste were disposed of in Singapore last year, of which only 6 per cent was recycled. In Singapore's voluntary national review presented to the United Nations High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development earlier this month, responsible consumption and production was one of five sustainable development goals it focused on. “In order to maintain a safe living environment with a high quality of life for current and future generations, Singapore’s approach to sustainable consumption and production is to become a Zero Waste Nation,” the voluntary national review report stated. “By reducing waste and our consumption of materials and goods, we also avoid depleting the earth’s resources through wasteful habits. This will keep Singapore clean, conserve precious resources, and reduce the need for space-consuming landfills.” As a consumer, here are some ways you can walk with a spring in your step knowing you've helped give wasteful consumption the boot. DON’T CHUCK THOSE CHUCKS, FIX THEM The MIT study, which broke down every possible greenhouse gas-emitting step in a shoe’s life cycle from the extraction of raw materials to the disposal of the shoes, attributed most of the carbon emissions to production processes, especially the materials processing (29 per cent) and manufacturing (68 per cent) stages. Veerappan Swaminathan, founder of social enterprise Sustainable Living Lab, said that as the footwear manufacturing industry for shoes sold in Singapore operates mostly in neighbouring countries, a lot of the local environmental challenges are \"externalised\". \"Materials used are often petrochemical byproducts, and as they are comprised of mixed materials are extremely difficult to separate for recycling ... Dyes used in the process of treating fabric are usually not processed properly, leading to poisoning of river streams.\" Ways to improve sustainability in the industry include consumer decisions to get longer lasting shoes, and keep them functional beyond their typical lifespan through repairs and restorations, Mr Swaminathan said.  Shoemaker Lisa Teng said that for her own shoes, she makes the effort to replace the soles if they wear out or create new designs through patchwork or stitches when the uppers get damaged.  Sports shoes are more complicated, Ms Teng said, as a lot of soles are manufactured to match the shoe shape. \"In my case, I would take the challenge and combine different components to fit the design.\" For those who aren't experts, Sustainable Living Lab runs Repair Kopitiam, a community initiative that teaches people how to repair items, including shoes, in an effort to combat \"throw away\" culture.  The free event is held at Block 452 Jurong West Street 42 and Block 890D Tampines Avenue 1 from 10am to 2pm every last Sunday of the month.  There are also off-the-shelf solutions such as Sugru, a silicone-based \"moldable glue\" that comes in various colours and has the consistency of Play-Doh. Out of the packet, it can be reshaped and pressed into most materials such as fabric and leather to cover small holes or tears. Left to cure for 24 hours, it hardens into a flexible rubber. The possibilities are endless: Fixing frayed laces, patching small tears in fabric uppers and sealing cracks in waterproof boots. As a bonus, the different colours can be combined in designs to customise your shoes. But when it comes to major repairs, it may be best to leave it to the specialists.  Cobbler Kay Ching Boh, one of a handful of old-timers who still ply their trade at an open space known as Cobbler Square in Chinatown, estimates that 10 to 20 people bring their shoes to him for repairs a week. From gluing on new soles to smoothing out scuffs on leather uppers, he does it all. \"There are no repairs too difficult if you really want to do them,\" he said.  The 67-year-old, a former hawker who taught himself how to fix shoes more than a decade ago by “secretly” watching others work, said people from all walks of life come to him to refresh their footgear, from young professionals in their 20s to retirees.  Another professional shoe fixer, who wanted to be known only by Uncle Tan, plies his trade under a nondescript walkway near Sengkang MRT station.  He charges as little as S$6 for repairs such as hand stitching on new soles – he boasts of being among the best at stitching up shoes, with about 10 needles of different sizes dedicated to the craft.  BUY SHOES MADE TO LAST Both Mr Kay and Uncle Tan told Channel NewsAsia they run a brisk business and avoid taking unnecessary cases, such as small repairs that customers can fix themselves. The cobblers also each had tips for customers to keep their shoes in good condition so they don't have to be fixed too frequently.  Mr Kay recommends that new pairs be waterproofed at a cobbler to extend their longevity. \"Sometimes people bring them to me to be treated after water has already seeped in but I tell them it's too late, you should have brought them to me when they were new,\" he said, shaking his head.  Meanwhile, Uncle Tan stressed the importance of wearing shoes regularly to keep the rubber from becoming brittle or decaying – he recently had a customer who left a S$400 pair of branded shoes unworn for two years; by the time he wanted to wear them the soles were \"black and sticky\" from rot and had to be replaced completely.  His hot tip for customers who want branded shoes on a budget: Buy them at warehouse sales for cheap, then bring them to him to stitch on the soles securely for a few dollars.  \"Shoes on sale have usually been sitting around for some time, so the glue would have weakened and the soles come off easily,\" he said. \"If you stitch them on, they will last longer.\" But the quality of the original shoe is also an important factor.  Mr Kay said he discourages people from trying to repair cheap shoes: \"It will cost more than what you paid to fix them, why bother? Just throw them away!\" Quality shoes, on the other hand, can be fixed again and again for years of wear.  Brandishing a pair of boots he was working on, he explained that as the calf skin uppers were holding up well, replacing the soles – the part most likely to be worn down through regular wear and tear – occasionally was all that was needed to keep the pair in good shape.  For S$12, he had glued on new non-slip soles, then painstakingly cut them down to size with a sharp razor. He let me scrutinise them: No rough edges.  Ken Lim, the owner of the boots, said he had brought four to five pairs of shoes to Mr Kay in the past year.  \"I'm very particular about shoes, so I like to buy those that are a bit more expensive,\" the 57-year-old retiree said.  \"Usually the upper part, after a while, will still be very good. It would be a waste to throw them away because the sole or heel is damaged. So I will come here to fix the sole or heel, and the whole shoe is like brand new again.\" Ms Teng agreed. \"These days, it is easy to get a cheap pair of shoes only to discard it quickly. However, the materials used are not environmentally friendly,\" she said.  For example, the shoe designer said she tries to avoid using PVC in her products as she discovered that over time, the material either becomes sticky or the coating flakes off.  \"It may seem expensive to invest in leather shoes, (but) it definitely lasts longer than most synthetic material,\" she said.  But durability may be less of a factor in the buying decisions of some consumer segments than style, according to Singapore Management University Associate Professor of Marketing Hannah Chang, who noted that there has been a growing fast fashion trend particularly among younger consumers in the last few years.  \"When it comes to fashion – be it clothes or shoes – there are different consumer segments with different buying processes and demands,\" the consumer behaviour expert said.  \"While for many consumers style and comfort remain the top decision criteria, younger consumers may care less about how long shoes last compared to older consumers.\" WEAR ECO-FRIENDLY MATERIALS Once under fire by environmental campaigners for their manufacturing practices, including allegedly polluting rivers with hazardous chemicals from its factories, major sports shoes manufacturers such as Nike and Adidas – two of the companies dominating the footwear industry in Singapore last year according to a report by Euromonitor – have found novel ways to turn trash into treasure.  Under its Nike Grind programme, the footwear giant recycles surplus manufacturing materials and footwear by separating and grinding up rubber, foam, fiber, leather and textile blends into granules, which are then incorporated into products including new Nike footwear and apparel as well as sports and playground surfaces. The company estimated in its latest sustainable business report that it had diverted about 5.67 million kilograms of factory and post-consumer waste from landfills with Nike Grind and that 75 per cent of its products contained some recycled material in the financial year of 2016-2017.  Adidas has also taken strides to improve its environmental friendliness, recently teaming up with environmental organisation Parley for the Oceans for its Parley range of shoes, made with plastic waste intercepted before it reaches the ocean. The German sportswear maker pledged earlier this month to using only recycled plastic in its products, including apparel and shoes, by 2024. There are also brands that have built eco-friendliness into their core brand ethos.  Indosole, for example, says on its website that it is \"on a mission to become the world's most responsible footwear company\".  The Bali-based footwear company re-purposes discarded tires into soles for sandals and shoes, which it says is an effort to prevent the waste tires from getting to landfills or incinerators, polluting the environment.  Meanwhile, Brazilian plastic shoe brand Melissa claims that its patented PVC material Melflex, which is used for all of its shoes, is 100 per cent recyclable, and Parisian sneaker brand Veja was built around environmental and social responsibility and focuses on sustainable materials such as wild rubber from the Amazon, a fabric created from recycled bottles and vegetable-tanned leather. IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM, DONATE If your problem with your shoes is not that they're falling apart but that you're tired of them and want a change, you could always give your pre-loved footwear a new lease of life by donating them.  Nashville-based charity Soles4Souls collects new and used shoes and redistributes them through direct donations to people in need as well as through micro-enterprise programmes that create jobs in Haiti, Honduras and other developing nations. Singapore lighting company Million Lighting partners the charity for shoe drives in Singapore as part of its corporate social responsibility. Soles4Soles said on its website that during their last shoe drive in April, 100,000 pairs of shoes were collected, bringing the total from the three shoe drives co-organised by the two organisations to 200,000 pairs.  For more regular donations, you can drop off new and used shoes in good condition at The Salvation Army's collection bins at eight locations island-wide, to be sold at Salvation Army's thrift stores. Sales from the stores contribute to the charity's efforts to help the underprivileged.  The Singapore Council of Women's Organisations also runs a thrift shop, with proceeds going towards its shelter for women and children who are victims of domestic violence and other SCWO initiatives.  NEXT STEPS Looking forward, Mr Swaminathan suggested that there could be policy-level interventions such as expanding requirements for producer responsibility, like those the Government intends to introduce to make manufacturers and retailers of electronic goods take responsibility for the disposal and recycling of their products.  Manufacturers, on their part, can improve the design of shoes to use more sustainable materials and reduce the complexity of shoes so they can be made with fewer parts. One way they can do this is through industrial 3D printing, he said.  The social entrepreneur also mooted the idea of new business models for selling sustainable footwear, such as footwear as a service.  \"Can there be a second-hand ownership or marketplace for shoes, if we can find a great way to address hygiene challenges?\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/shoes-environment-sustainable-consumption-fix-repair-10545502"}, {"datetime": "28 Jul 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["education", "PSLE", "streaming", "secondary school", "meritocracy"], "author": "Azmoon Ahmad", "title": "Commentary: Two ideas to level the education playing field", "content": " SINGAPORE: The role of education in sustaining social and economic progress in Singapore is being robustly discussed today. It stems particularly from social phenomena like inequality, which have given rise to concerns whether the playing field will be tilted further in the future economic landscape and if the education system can fix it. MERITOCRACY AND EQUITY The argument that meritocracy, despite all its potential to perpetuate achievement gaps in education, remains the best model for nurturing talent, is valid. Singapore’s approach to creating a more level playing field is to uplift the bottom percentiles rather than introduce greater equity by dealing with the advantages that the top ones enjoy. If uplifting the performance of the struggling ones is to remain the philosophy in attaining more equitable outcomes in education, then its approach needs to be discussed more critically. Affluent parents have a significant advantage in strategising for their children’s educational success and have their social networks to capitalise on. While it can be argued that no matter what system is implemented, the wealthy will always be better equipped to seize its benefits, the current state of inequality suggests that there is plenty of room for improvement.  Two features of the education system that are believed to be creating a hierarchy among students are the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and early streaming. ALTERNATIVE TO THE PSLE A toned-down version of the PSLE – the shift from T-score to wider scoring bands – and continuing efforts to make it less of a high-stakes examination is welcomed. However, in whatever form it remains, it is unlikely to eliminate the deeply entrenched focus on grades among parents to get their children into desired programmes or pathways. To address this, it is worth revisiting the argument against the PSLE. If the trade-off for scrapping the PSLE is a concern, then the Government may wish to consider a dual system in which the PSLE is made optional. Students vying for the more challenging pathways in secondary schools, like the Integrated Programme, can take the PSLE to boost their chances. For parents who see the PSLE as an obstacle to a holistic education, I propose a 10-year alternative education system that integrates primary and secondary school education with its own framework for evaluating progress. This 10-year system should aim to help develop students’ capabilities, identify their potential and help them specialise in a subject they are strong in, be it in the fields of arts, science or commerce. It should recognise a broader range of competencies than the binary academic-technical dichotomy that characterises the present secondary school system.     Instead of a high-stakes examination, periodic assessments, say every two years, are conducted not for the purpose of placement, but to ensure students are making progress and assistance is rendered where necessary. The decision on whether a student should pursue an academic or vocational track should come at the end of the 10-year programme, by which time knowledge about his or her inclinations would be more valid than that for a 12-year-old. THE DOWNSIDES OF STREAMING A key concern with the streaming system at the outset of secondary education is its tendency to lump together lower performing students, which would include the late bloomer, the socioeconomically challenged and the hands-on learner. For this reason, it is risky to label a child as not academically inclined at 12 years of age. Greater recognition, for instance, need to be accorded to the fact that children from the lower deciles of the income strata have to overcome unfavourable socioeconomic conditions – such as the lack of a conducive study space at home or parental help with schoolwork – to level up with their peers. Underperformers may be talented students whose need for more time and help should not be taken as signs that they are academically weak and thus lead them to be sorted into lower achievement tracks, something a system of early streaming is prone to doing. This merely compounds the problems they face in education. Educational pathways should be meaningful. They should be committed to honing abilities or nurturing talent, and should be aimed at helping individuals discover their strengths and stand out. Educational pathways cannot just offer a longer route towards the same destination, such as a polytechnic or a university. So some thought should be given, for instance, to how the Normal Academic and Normal Technical streams fit with the larger goal of producing individuals with deep skills and talent with their simplified curriculum. HELP ALL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS  The education landscape today features many more pathways to educational and personal success than in the past. The definition of merit is being broadened and policies are being introduced to promote greater inclusivity. Efforts are being made to ensure that there are opportunities for all regardless of socioeconomic status. However, a pertinent question to ask is whether parents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have the financial and social capital to actively act on the knowledge of these diverse pathways and greater opportunities. Given that their bandwidth is taxed daily by their struggles to make ends meet, are they being given the necessary help and guidance to make the most out of the changes to an education system that is supposed to make opportunities more accessible to them? ACTUALISING TALENT DEVELOPMENT At a more micro-level, parents of lower primary students have been lamenting about how tough school work is for children these days.  For example, Primary 2 students are now expected to draw problem sum models when, in the past, these were reserved only for older primary students. How can the abstract concept of modelling be effectively and comprehensively explained to an 8-year-old child who is only two years into the primary school system? The question of whether our education system is inducing stress is not only about well-being but is also of strategic significance.  If parents are struggling to devote time and resources to ensure their children do homework and pass tests, it leaves less time to undertake the exploratory pursuits which facilitates joy in learning and nurture attributes like an inquisitive mind in children. This is antithetical to the objective of developing talent. THE FUTURE A level playing field is not only about being inclusive but also prevents the talent pool from being constricted. Socioeconomic background is a predictor of ability only because existing standardised measures and structures confer recognition to some groups while disadvantaging others. Hence, going forward, the key is to continue reviewing these measures and structures, and work towards an education system that considers the child holistically and as an individual who is unique.

A brief silence descended as a stall employee addressed them. “We are giving out the free durians at 4pm. Within 20 minutes, please finish eating. If you cannot finish, please take away the durians,” she announced, to cheers and claps from the senior citizens who had all been earlier issued Pioneer Generation stickers to qualify for the free fruit. Sam Fruit Trading is one of a handful of durian sellers in Singapore and Malaysia that have been giving away stock for free, thanks to a glut of Malaysian durians that has driven prices to a 20-year low. In fact, this was the stall’s second giveaway in as many weeks, with over 1,000 kg of durians distributed for free at each session.   But with this cheap run expected to come to an end next week as Johor’s durian supply runs out, and China muscling into the market for the mao shan wang variety, are the days of cheap premium durians over? The programme Talking Point asked this question following weeks in which mao shan wang durians hit a price low of S$10 a kg, down from the usual S$28 to S$35. The ‘red prawn’, D13 and D24 varieties dropped to just S$6, down from an average of S$15. So far this year, Singapore has imported 8,900 tonnes of fresh and chilled durians – about six million durians. Almost all came from neighbouring Malaysia. But the good times could be over sooner than we think. CHINA’S DURIAN HUNGER Over at Durian Fullhouse, managing director Siah Wee Cheong is happy that sales have doubled thanks to the low prices and promotional efforts. But, he said, production has already started to drop by about 70 to 80 percent. “Johor should run out of durians in the next week or so,” he predicted. “In fact, prices have been rising since last week.” Durians will still be in supply, albeit more limited, from Pahang and the Genting Highlands region. He projected that mao shan wang could hit S$28 to S$30 per kg come August, or about three times more than the low reported earlier this month. And then, there is the expectation that Malaysia will receive approval to export fresh whole mao shan wang durians to China next year. Demand is so high there that each kilogramme of the fruit (which currently can only be imported in pulp, frozen or chilled form) can reportedly cost more than S$100. What would this mean for durian lovers in Singapore? Mr Lim See Kiang, owner of a durian plantation in Tangkak, Johor, didn’t think this would affect supply to across the Causeway. “Johor is closer to Singapore, so it’s more convenient to export durians there,” he said. Durians from Thailand would be more likely to better survive the transport to China, he added. Thai durians, in general, are harvested just before they ripen. Malaysian durians, however, are collected only after they ripen and drop. “That means we have to be quick,” said Mr Lim. “If the market is too far away, the flavours would have changed and the durians would not be fresh.” WATCH: At a durian farm (2:29)  The best time to collect durians is between 4am and 6am, which is when the most durians will drop from the tree, he said. “In the afternoon, the durian’s flavour will be worse.” Plantations would then need to rush these durians to Singapore within three hours. When the Talking Point crew was at his 80-acre plantation, Mr Lim’s workers had 5 tonnes of durians harvested and packed in crates by 7.30am, for loading on a truck headed for Singapore. FREE STILL GOOD  In recent weeks, durian lovers have had the weather in Johor to thank for bountiful harvests, which have led to rock-bottom prices – the lowest in 20 years, suppliers say – on both sides of the Causeway. This year’s harvest is not only larger but also better in terms of quality compared to previous years, said Mr Lim, primarily because of the ideal weather. Trees require just the right combination of sun, rain and perfect timing for a good yield: A dry spell of 15 to 20 days to initiate flowering, high rainfall for a month until the flowers mature, another 10 days of dry spell for pollination, and 45 days of rainfall for better fruit growth. “The rainfall and weather (this year) is optimal, which is to say, we didn’t have rain all the time,” he said. Which means that just because some sellers have been giving away durians for free, it doesn’t mean they are of bad quality, he noted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Now that Johor’s harvest is running out, durians coming from Pahang and the Genting Highlands region will likely cost more, but quality should be even better. Said Durian Fullhouse’s Mr Siah: “There are a few mountains around the Genting Highlands, and every mountain produces different flavours. The higher the mountain, the thicker the flavour.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

Driverless cars use LiDAR sensors to build a three-dimensional (3D) map of objects around the vehicle. The sensors send out light beams and detect those that are reflected back in order to measure where obstacles are. That is how autonomous vehicles avoid collisions and keep other road users safe.  Currently, LiDAR sensors make use of laser diodes to generate laser beams. These sensors spin furiously to cover a 360-degree view of a car’s surroundings and create the 3D map.   But this makes LiDAR sensors expensive and ephemeral. “Because of the mechanical moving parts, you have to actually replace the LiDAR before you have to replace your car tyres,” said Dr Nam Donguk, who is the lead researcher on the LiDAR sensors project.  But NTU’s researchers have found a way to emit light from a silicon chip instead, which will replace the need for the diodes. They found a way to stretch germanium – commonly used as transistors in electronics, especially in central processing units (CPUs) – and found that the element is better able to emit light when stretched.  It is the first time scientists have been able to find a way to emit light from a material that is compatible with silicon. In fact, it was previously thought to be close to impossible to create an on-chip laser for LiDAR – also known as a solid state LiDAR.  CHEAPER AND BETTER Currently, the cheapest conventional LiDAR sensor costs S$10,000, while the solid state micro LiDAR chip will cost just S$50 when it is commercially-ready. “Since we can make our LiDAR chip with our technology using mass production, which means anybody can buy it with maybe S$50, it will open up the opportunities for maybe smaller companies who want to make autonomous vehicle technology to be ready,” said Dr Nam.  “As of now, conventional LiDAR is too expensive, so not many companies can really jump in so easily.” Another benefit is that image quality from the micro LiDAR silicon chip will be of a much higher resolution, thanks to the density of lasers on the chip, and images can be retrieved much faster than with conventional LiDAR sensors. The breakthrough is also likely to make other technologies cheaper, faster and more reliable.  For example, the micro LiDAR chip can be mounted on drones, which is currently impossible given the heavy weight of conventional LiDAR sensors. It could also be used in mobile phone chips. “The other possibility that I can think of is basically to replace WiFi technology with light communication, we call it LiFi technology,” said Dr Tan Chuan Seng, Associate Chair (Research) in NTU’s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, who oversees the project. “Those are the exciting applications we can foresee.\" The team behind the project has been awarded a grant by the National Research Foundation to get the technology ready for commercial use, which could be in the next five years.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-researchers-discovery-lidar-sensor-autnomous-vehicles-10569472"}, {"datetime": "27 Jul 2018 08:13PM", "tags": ["SGX"], "author": "Brandon Tanoto", "title": "SGX posts biggest net profit in 10 years", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Exchange reported on Friday (Jul 27) that its full-year net profit rose 6.9 per cent to S$363.2 million, its biggest in a decade, supported by record derivatives trading volumes and bond listings. The net profit is the highest since the S$444 million logged in 2008, and was helped by efforts over the past year to grow its asset classes and markets, advance its securities market and optimise resources, the bourse operator said. Revenue came in at S$844.7 million for the fiscal year ended June, 5.5 per cent higher than the previous year. Looking forward, however, escalating global trade tensions and moderating global growth could result in higher market volatility, SGX cautioned. \"FY2018 was a record milestone in our financial performance ... All three core businesses registered higher revenues,\" said SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye.  \"As we move into the new financial year, our strategy will focus on cementing our position as a multi-asset exchange, while growing our international presence and widening our partnerships and networks,\" he added.  Ms Pan Jingyi, market strategist at IG Markets said that SGX’s move to continue building links with other exchanges globally is “wise”, considering potential challenges from geopolitical risks. She cited the possibility of the US following through with another US$200 billion in tariffs in late August as a potential downside risk. “It’s a bit of an inflection point. On one hand you seem to have good growth, which is pretty sustainable at the moment, but at the same time, risks and clouds are gathering in the form of geopolitical risks and trade tensions which have led markets to be a little bit more concerned on whether we will see a slowdown come through in the second half of the year,\" said Ms Pan.  However, she continues to maintain a positive outlook on the bourse’s share price performance going forward. “With the disturbance of the World Cup lifted, trading volumes are expected to rise and slightly help with the trajectory of the upside for SGX,” she said. During the fourth quarter, net profit fell 1.8 per cent to S$83.7 million from the year-ago period, dragged down by an increase in operating expenses including higher staff costs, and a slight dip in revenue from its equities and fixed income businesses.

Yesterday, we carried out the plans we had worked on and I expect to do the same tomorrow.\" Attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who joined Arsenal from Manchester United in January, said it was too early to compare Wenger and Emery but was full of praise for both men. \"It's difficult to compare the two coaches. They are both great but I have only just started working with Unai Emery and will need at least six months to one year to really be able to compare them,\" the Armenian said. \"I didn't really work that long with Arsene Wenger and Unai Emery has just arrived, but I can say one thing - it's a pleasure to work with both of them.\" Arsenal open the new season with a home match against champions Manchester City on Aug 12.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-emery-looks-beyond-psg-reunion-towards-next-season-10569174"}, {"datetime": "27 Jul 2018 07:24PM", "tags": ["court", "corruption", "mindef"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Former RSAF engineer jailed for cheating Government in contracts worth over S$1.8m", "content": " SINGAPORE: A former Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) engineer who cheated the Government in contracts worth over S$1.8 million was sentenced to jail for more than two years on Friday (Jul 27). Rajkumar Padmanathan, 49, was with the force from 1989 until 2012. Between 2008 and 2012, he held the position of Bay In-Charge of the Fire Control Flight at Tengah Air Base. His work required him to raise requests for repair or maintenance works at the air base, which independent contractors then tendered for. After receiving quotations from the contractors, Rajkumar would give his recommendation to his superiors, who would determine which contractor to award the jobs to. But the air force was unaware that he was involved in four businesses that tendered for RSAF jobs between 2010 and 2014. During that period, he tendered for the jobs himself and recommended that the contracts be awarded to him or his accomplices. In 2010, he incorporated the company Goodwill Aviations System with his wife Jayashree Rajkumar as the sole director and shareholder. His wife acted as the front for the company, which submitted quotations for aircraft repair and maintenance works required by the RSAF. Rajkumar was familiar with what the lowest bidding prices were. Goodwill Aviations System was awarded 99 jobs with a total value of nearly S$869,000 between 2010 and 2012. The company performed the works and received payment from the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF). In late 2010, Rajkumar and his friend Jeevan Arumugam set up a company, Eagle Flight Aviation Services, for the same purposes. Between 2011 and 2012, Eagle Flight Aviation Services was awarded 67 jobs worth more than S$632,000. Rajkumar was also involved in two other companies, Duratech Engineering and Global Trade Well. Duratech Engineering won 27 jobs worth more than S$259,000 while Global Trade Well was awarded 10 jobs with a value of more than S$27,000. HE LEFT RSAF IN 2012 BUT STILL CONTINUED CHEATING Rajkumar left the RSAF in July 2012. More than a year later he joined One Marina Property Services, where his job was to source for contractors for works that were requested by the firm on RSAF's behalf. From 2013 to 2014, Rajkumar helped Eagle Flight Aviation Services win 14 jobs worth about S$29,000. At the beginning of 2014, Rajkumar became acquainted with RSAF engineer Sung Way Xiong, 29, as they both worked at Sembawang Air Base. Rajkumar knew that Sung had access to confidential information, including pricing on various items and inventory. He asked Sung to reveal to him such information and said he would employ him with a good pay package when Sung left the RSAF. He also said that he would share some of his profits with Sung if business was good. Sung agreed and gave confidential pricing information to Rajkumar on 33 occasions in 2014. Rajkumar used this information in preparing quotations for RSAF jobs. Sung later asked Rajkumar for his promised share of the profits, but did not receive any money, nor was he employed by Rajkumar. DEFENCE SAYS RAJKUMAR WANTED TO 'IMPROVE THINGS' Rajkumar had pleaded guilty in May to 19 cheating charges, as well as eight charges under the Official Secrets Act and one charge of corruption. Another 223 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. On Friday, his defence lawyer Bernice Leong said that Rajkumar merely wanted to improve what RSAF was being offered by other vendors. She argued that the works were completed and were of satisfactory quality. But District Judge Edgar Foo did not buy this argument, saying: \"It cannot be just to help RSAF. If it was, then it should have been done pro bono.\" The judge sentenced Rajkumar to 25 months and six weeks in jail. He allowed Rajkumar to defer his sentence for two weeks to tend to his elderly mother who was ill. Rajkumar's accomplice Sung was given 10 weeks' jail in May, while Jeevan's trial will be held next month. MINDEF and the Singapore Armed Forces said in a statement in May that they detected irregularities during periodic internal audits in July 2015 and surfaced the case to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau for investigation.  \"MINDEF (and) SAF have a zero tolerance policy towards corruption.

From the major cyberattack on SingHealth, to fraudulent transactions on customers’ iTunes accounts, to revelations that the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) was actually hacked some years ago, the issue has been the source of much discussion. The attack on SingHealth has been called the biggest data breach in Singapore. The personal information of 1.5 million patients was stolen, along with the outpatient prescription records of 160,000 people. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was among those affected, and his personal particulars and outpatient prescription records were \"specifically and repeatedly\" targeted.  What is so valuable about medical records? Sid Deshpande, Research Director at Gartner who specialises in security infrastructure and services, gave this explanation in this week’s Asia Business First podcast: “The data contained in the entire healthcare record is more valuable than that of a credit card breach. You can always cancel or change a credit card once the breach is disclosed.  \"But in a health record, you have your national identity number, you have your bank account details, you have other types of e-governance details to spoof your identity and to conduct identity fraud, medical fraud and tax fraud.” However, it is believed that the SingHealth data breach was the work of state-sponsored hackers. Steve Ledzian, Technical Director for Asia with cybersecurity company FireEye, shared his thoughts on the matter. “It does not look like this was the work of casual cybercriminals. It looks like it was likely to be the work of a sophisticated threat actor. In that case, the value of the data may not be for commercial or fraudulent financial purposes. But more for intelligence collection or espionage purposes.”   Nevertheless, these incidents raise questions about how well-protected people's personal information really is. According to Mr Deshpande, total prevention of cyberattacks is not possible. “The problem is while you are in your bed sleeping at 4am in the morning, the attackers are up, trying their best to get into your environment. So, unless you are spending all your time on security, 24/7 – which is what organisations should be doing – you are not putting in an adequate effort commensurate with what the attackers are doing.” Mr Ledzian had this analogy: “Would you expect to be able to prevent all crime in all cases? Of course not. From a cybersecurity perspective, you can prevent a lot of these breaches, but you cannot prevent all of them. “The way that attackers attack – it is actually quite easy for them to break into a network. But the impact of that attack does not align to the moment they gain entry into the network. So while breaches are inevitable, the consequences and the impact of the breach do not have to be.  \"It is impossible to say, ‘Someone will never break into my house.’ But we can say, ‘If they do break into my house, I can react very quickly and I can stop them before they do any damage.’ ” Mr Deshpande elaborated on how that might be achieved. “While prevention is an important thing to focus on, detection and response is something that organisations and governments need to invest in. To make sure that once a breach happens, they are able to limit the impact and damage of it.” He emphasized that the solution did not lie in buying more “shiny new technology”, but rather, focussing on the basics of security and risk management. “There is no one-stop shop for this problem. If you look back to last year when we experienced a lot of security incidents around the world – particularly the Wannacry incident – the primary reason those organisations were breached is that they had not patched a vulnerability that the industry knew about for three months.  \"An attacker is not always looking for some newly-researched vulnerability. They are looking for the low-hanging fruit. They will first try methods that have worked in other areas and then they will move higher up the chain. So focus on the basics and you will make the attacker’s job more difficult.” To listen to the full Asia Business First podcast, click here.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-singhealth-protection-prevention-10568850"}, {"datetime": "27 Jul 2018 05:47PM", "tags": ["Singapore Airlines", "SIA", "earnings", "aviation", "stocks", "investment"], "author": "", "title": "SIA shares fall 5.5% after weaker airfares hit earnings", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines’ shares fell by as much as 5.5 per cent on Friday (July 27), their biggest one-day drop in over a year, after the carrier reported a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit the day before.

The online initiative, called the ASEAN Judiciaries Portal (AJP), is the first of its kind. Initially mooted at the 1st Council of ASEAN Chief Justices' (CACJ) Meeting in August 2013, it was officially launched on Friday at the sixth CACJ meeting. \"It provides a platform through which anyone can discover, appreciate, and learn more about the judiciaries and legal environments of the various ASEAN member states,\" said Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon during his opening address at the meeting. \"It is our hope that the knowledge afforded by having easy access to such information will support commerce and promote the flow of investments into the ASEAN region.\"  A members-only secure section within the portal also provides a platform for ASEAN judiciaries to share knowledge, Singapore's Supreme Court said in a press release. The portal, however, benefits more than just the 10 nations within the regional bloc.  Mr Morten Hoglund, the Norwegian Ambassador to ASEAN, said it will benefit small and medium businesses in Norway as it makes it easier for their companies to penetrate the ASEAN market. The Norwegian government played an important role in the portal, contributing about US$441,000 to its development and maintenance until 2020. Mr Hoglund said: \"I have for some time highlighted this specific project as a key example of how we make it easier for Norwegian companies to access all of ASEAN; how concrete integration is taking place by such an action and how we assist in closing the development gap.\" Mr Wendell Wong, director of dispute relations at Drew & Napier LLC called the portal \"an excellent tool” for investors. \"In this day and age of international trade, access to information is key, so the faster you find the information, the easier it is for you to make your investment decisions,\" he said.  \"ASEAN presents a very unique investment opportunity not just for local investors, but for investors around the world.  \"Lawyers can use this portal as a first stop to get the necessary information as well.\" The 6th CACJ Meeting was held alongside the 13th ASEAN Law Association General Assembly and the ASEAN Law Conference, which end on Saturday.

The board will take on the role from Apr 1 2019, as part of the government's reorganisation of food, plant health and animal management functions announced on Thursday (Jul 26).  All non-food plant and animal-related functions of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) will be transferred to NParks from April next year, with a new statutory board taking over food safety and security functions currently overseen by three agencies. With that, AVA will be disbanded. Local wildlife experts told Channel NewsAsia that the move will allow for the better pooling of resources as NParks seeks to conserve Singapore's natural heritage. \"I welcome the news,\" said veteran wildlife consultant Subaraj Rajathurai. \"For the longest time, we have been worried that the AVA can't cope. They are stretched too thin and are unable to prioritise certain things which we feel are important.\" \"It is important to know that we're separating managing wildlife from management of food-related issues,\" he added. \"Putting the two together in the past was a bit up in the air ... We cannot have too many agencies spoiling the broth. This move will allow people to work closer together to find solutions.\" Tackling issues such as the illegal wildlife trade, and finding a solution for animal-human \"conflict\" are issues that the new-look NParks should seek to address, added Mr Rajathurai. BEST OF BOTH WORLDS Dr Shawn Lum, president of Nature Society (Singapore) (NSS), hailed the move as one which will bring together the best of both worlds. \"I'm very encouraged by this. It's quite similar to what some have been requesting for years - but it's even better now that it's under one agency,\" said Dr Lum.  \"I think at every level our response to wildlife-related issues will be now streamlined. We take the best of AVA's animal expertise and bring that together with the NParks' experience on the ground and in the field, and what we could get is something even better than the sum of two groups previously. \"The AVA are very committed to these issues, and they have very good people who are doing a good job, but I think now that it is under a single agency, you can have a shared sort of objective and the response can come from one agency instead of two, so there would be better coordination.\" This sentiment was echoed by chief executive officer of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Singapore Elaine Tan, who stressed the need for NParks to tackle the loss of biodiversity. \"It is a welcomed move that NParks, with its comprehensive knowledge on conservation, will take the lead on biodiversity issues including wildlife conflict, illegal wildlife trade, and the protection and conservation of precious natural resources,\" she added. But for the NParks to function optimally, Dr Lum of NSS believes that the agency has to be given more financial support. This could allow them to designate more resources to track wildlife, delegate more manpower to monitor the illegal wildlife trade and even draw up more programmes to encourage more young people to go into conservation policy, he added. \"If we invested just a little bit more in some key human resources, we could truly realise the potential of this new arrangement. It's already very good but it could be even better.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nparks-revamp-wildlife-experts-welcome-move-10568172"}, {"datetime": "27 Jul 2018 02:18PM", "tags": ["football", "Mesut Ozil", "Arsenal", "International Champions Cup"], "author": "", "title": "'So much love': Ozil thanks Arsenal fans after Germany racism row", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mesut Ozil thanked Arsenal fans for their \"love\" at a pre-season friendly after a torrid week following his racism allegations against Germany's football body.

Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates rose to 2.1 per cent in June this year, from 2 per cent in March, when the lowest unemployment rate was recorded since March last year. In June, an estimated 69,500 residents were unemployed, higher than the 64,800 in March, said MOM. The unemployment rate for residents rose from 2.8 per cent to 3 per cent, and went up from 3 per cent from 3 per cent for Singapore citizens, according to an advance release of the first-quarter labour market report. The ministry added that this is because more people entered the workforce on the back of continued expansion in economic activities. Preliminary data showed that total employment grew despite the higher unemployment and retrenchment rates, said MOM. Total employment, excluding foreign domestic workers, increased by 7,100 in the second quarter of the year. This increase is larger than the 400 seen in the first quarter. MOM added that this reflected the moderated pace of contractions in construction and manufacturing employment. The service sector also continued to add workers in areas like transportation and storage, professional services, and financial and insurance.  The increase in the second quarter of 2018 was also a reversal from the contraction observed in the same period a year ago. According to the release, unemployment rates have been trending downwards since June 2017, and the rates in June 2018 remained lower than in June last year. Structural challenges such as skills and job mismatches continue to be one of the maincause of unemployment in Singapore, noted NTUC Assistant Secretary-General Patrick Tay in a Facebook post on Friday. \"We need to continue our efforts in supporting mature workers and PMETs as they are most vulnerable in the current labour market situation as majority of the layoffs affect PMETs,\" he added. RETRENCHMENTS EDGE UP Meanwhile, the number of retrenchments edged up to 2,500 this quarter from 2,320 in the preceding quarter. Retrenchment numbers have seen a downtrend since the fourth quarter of 2016. MOM added that the retrenchment figures reflected ongoing restructuring and reorganisation. However, this quarter's retrenchment figures are lower than the same period a year ago when 3,640 people were retrenched. While retrenchment numbers were higher in manufacturing, they remained largely unchanged in construction and declined in services. The labour union's Mr Tay expects retrenchment figures to rise in the third quarter. \"I expect to see retrenchment figures inch up in Q3 as we continue to see pockets of layoffs due to reorganisation, restructuring and restrategisation amidst technological/digital disruption including uncertainties caused by the US trade sanctions,\" he said.

Earlier this year, Uber sold its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab in exchange for a stake in the Singapore-based firm. But the deal has prompted regulatory scrutiny. In early July, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) provisionally found that the merger had substantially reduced competition and suggested various remedies, such as the sale of their car-leasing businesses and removing exclusivity obligations on drivers who use Grab's ride-hailing platform. The CCCS is set to make a decision after Grab submitted its representation this week, and also taking into account public feedback. It has proposed fines on the firms. Grab disagreed with CCCS' assessment that the merger had harmed competition. In a written response, Grab said that it competes with all other transportation service providers for the same limited pool of commuters, citing a rider survey stating that 85 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that public transport options are substitutes for ride-sharing apps. The competitive transportation industry has led to its diversity of services such as GrabHitch and GrabShare, to cater to different price points, it added. With regard to the commission's suggestion for Grab to remove its exclusivity arrangements with drivers, Grab said CCCS has allowed other players and new entrants to maintain or enter into exclusivity arrangements with drivers, private hire rental fleet and taxi operators without restrictions. \"Grab believes that this double standard goes against the spirit of increasing choices for drivers and riders,\" it said, adding that Grab has proposed to the CCCS to lift its exclusivity arrangements, subject to it being applied evenly across the industry. \"Current market realities unfortunately do not reflect this, for instance, taxi operators are still able to restrict their drivers' ability to receive fixed-fare jobs on other platforms,\" it said. The CCCS has said the exclusivity arrangements mean a new entrant would have to spend a lot of money to build up driver and rider networks similar in scale and size to the incumbents. Grab was the dominant player in Singapore's ride-hailing market even before the Uber merger. It also competes with taxi businesses such as ComfortDelGro Corp Ltd. Several new players, such as India's Jugnoo and Singapore-based Ryde, have recently entered the city-state's ride-hailing market. Indonesia's Go-Jek has also said it would launch services in Singapore. Grab said it welcomes this competition and trusts that the CCCS would take appropriate measures to ensure a level playing field in the industry \"without unduly favouring or disadvantaging any particular player\". The CCCS' decision could have wider implications, with Malaysia also saying this month that it was studying monopoly risks triggered by the merger of Grab and Uber. Grab, which maintains that it operates in a market that is broader than private-hire and taxi-booking services, also said it has retained its pre-transaction pricing and driver commissions.

Real estate agency ERA noted that the lower loan-to-value limits introduced with the latest round of property cooling measures will affect HDB buyers who take bank loans. \"This is likely to keep HDB resale prices in check,\" said Key Executive Officer Eugene Lim. \"However, there will be demand from en bloc sellers who wish to keep part of their proceeds from their sale, and hence choose to downgrade to an HDB flat while keeping the rest for retirement or investment,\" Mr Lim added. Property agency PropNex agreed that the HDB market could benefit from demand from en bloc sellers, especially those considering bigger-sized resale flats as their replacement homes. “As this segment is not affected by the revisions to the ABSD (Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty), we believe it will depict greater resilience in the market in the coming quarters,\" said PropNex CEO Ismail Gafoor. Mr Ismail said he forecasts HDB resale prices to increase by up to 1 per cent in 2018. ERA's Mr Lim was less optimistic, saying that he expects prices to remain flat or decline by up to 1 per cent this year. HDB RENTALS UP The number of HDB flats rented out rose by 2.6 per cent from 11,721 in the first quarter to 12,024 in the second quarter. When compared to the same period a year ago, the number was up 10 per cent. As of Jun 30, there were 54,896 HDB flats rented out, up 1 per cent from Mar 31.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bto-flats-hdb-resale-prices-second-quarter-10566860"}, {"datetime": "27 Jul 2018 08:43AM", "tags": ["property", "URA"], "author": "", "title": "Private home prices up 3.4% in second quarter", "content": " SINGAPORE: Private home prices rose 3.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year, according to the latest figures from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Friday (Jul 27).

EFFECTS OF COOLING MEASURES TO COME SOON: ERA, PROPNEX While the property market is showing signs of recovery, the effects of additional cooling measures introduced earlier this month may be felt soon, real estate agency PropNex said. “While the market witnessed a continued positive growth this quarter, the repercussions of the sudden cooling measures are expected to be felt in the coming quarters,\" said PropNex CEO Ismail Gafoor. \"Buyers and investors might start to adopt a 'wait-and-see' attitude to gauge the effects of the measures,\" he added. He noted that developers will also factor in the higher rates for the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \"At recent launches, developers are also adjusting their development prices sensitively with some offering discounts of up to 10 per cent, factoring in the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty increase that their buyers will incur.  \"These will indirectly correlate to the price index movements in the coming quarters,\" he said.  Real estate agency ERA said it expects price growth in the private property market to slow or even plateau with the recent cooling measures. \"Almost all segments of the market are affected by the new measures, but we expect the largest impact to be felt among the luxury segment,\" said Key Executive Officer Eugene Lim. Mr Lim said ERA has lowered its price growth estimate for the private housing market from between 10 to 12 per cent to between 7 and 10 per cent, while PropNex's Mr Ismail said he expects prices to grow between 7 and 9 per cent this year. EN BLOC FEVER TO COOL: ANALYST CBRE said it expects the en bloc market to cool down with the new measures' impact on land acquisitions. Under the new cooling measures, companies buying properties will pay ABSD rates of 25 per cent – up from 15 per cent – with developers paying an additional 5 per cent. \"Developers will have to adjust their pricing expectations, marketing strategies and timing of their launches,\" CBRE said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/private-home-prices-up-3-4-in-second-quarter-10566862"}, {"datetime": "27 Jul 2018 06:16AM", "tags": ["cybersecurity", "singhealth", "Internet", "cyberattacks", "MOH"], "author": "Benjamin Goh", "title": "Commentary: Implement Internet separation? Let’s learn from industry best practices", "content": " SINGAPORE: Last Friday (Jul 20), the public learnt about SingHealth’s cyber breach that affected 1.5 million patients. The alleged intention of the breach was to get the Prime Minister’s medication information. According to Cyber Security Agency of Singapore chief executive David Koh, this was a “deliberate, targeted, and well-planned” attack, suggesting that Singapore’s infrastructure was being targeted by malevolent actors. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has shown astute leadership, urging the country to press on with its plans of going digital, to build a secure and smart nation. The challenge, however, is that personally identifiable information does not change over time; once compromised, it cannot be reclaimed from bad actors. Hacks on the US government today, for example, can be traced back to information lost during the massive hacks on the Office of Personnel Management discovered in 2015. This cyberattack, and others that may follow, might make citizens more vulnerable. If the instances of data loss increase and adverse impact on citizens rises significantly, Singaporeans would need much more than a statement of assurance to continue believing in Singapore’s Smart Nation plans. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong has announced, for now, that the solution to making the hospital more secure is through implementing Internet separation.  As a tool to limit the inflow and outflow of data, Internet separation will certainly reduce the number of potential entry points into a system, giving information assets slightly better protection than before.  It may help to improve data security within the hospital, as Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has pointed out. INTERNET SEPARATION IS NOT A CURE-ALL However, Internet separation is not a “one size fits all” solution for all Internet breaches. Firstly, Internet separation creates usability challenges that may be sub-optimal. Asking a doctor to toggle between computers or systems would hinder the doctor’s ability to process consultations faster and potentially hurt doctor-patient interactions. Furthermore, Internet separation may not be applicable to many situations. Just consider the cyberattacks on four local universities uncovered earlier this year where unsuspecting users directed to a phishing website were found to be the cause. It would be untenable and unproductive to get students to use separate devices for school work.  Similarly, in our desire to implement driverless cars, it would be prohibitively expensive to institute a separate network for them and still expect them to function effectively. LOOK TO INDUSTRY STANDARD PROTECTION MEASURES Perhaps we should consider other industry standard techniques already in the market that can improve security without compromising usability. Most advanced digitalised companies, for example, employ secure IT architecture design in their systems.  A secure IT architecture system defines a rigorous set of protocols, process and technical controls that define how information flows across systems within a company. For example, the architecture would specify encryption standards and firewalls that guard against unauthorised access to private networks connected to the Internet. This allows frontline users to still use the Internet, without being afraid that their actions online might compromise the entire company. Furthermore, secure IT architecture systems adhere to a list of guiding security principles that have been endorsed by leading industry players.  These principles include using secure default passwords, securing the weakest link, and avoiding “security by obscurity” — the process of trying to be secure by unplugging one’s systems from the Internet. LOOK TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS There are internationally recognised standards that companies can adhere to in order to build a robust system — ISO 27001, for example, helps companies identify, analyse and address its information risks. IEC 27033 gives companies a manual to create a secure network architecture in day-to-day business dealings, such as securing communications between networks through gateways and firewalls. Finally, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology cloud computing security standards help companies design a secure reference architecture even if their operations requires processing information in the open cloud. These standards try to assist companies to build secure systems without necessarily clamping down on Internet access or compromising the usability of the systems.  Going forward, we might consider encouraging companies to adhere to such standards in order to promote an open digital space that is built on secure foundations. Nevertheless, even though an IT security architecture can create security without significantly sacrificing usability, defining the network dependencies and vulnerabilities takes time, making it a great “peacetime” solution before a hack happens.  Internet separation, on the other hand, potentially presents a rapid fix post-hack that can quickly stop the bleeding and get business back to normal as soon as possible. LOOK AT THE ECOSYSTEM, NOT JUST THE CYBERATTACKS Perhaps the issue here is that cyber incidents are all too often seen as a problem of dealing with cyberattacks. If we similarly framed health issues as viral infections, we could miss out more fundamental solutions which address the root cause, such as boosting patients’ immune systems or adjustments to their lifestyles. But if we reframe the issue of cyberattacks by looking at our current security and protection systems, we can have targeted initiatives to improve cybersecurity “lifestyles” rather than be fixated with specific viral events. Such measures might require deeper and heavier fundamental investments, but let us not be penny-wise and ultimately pound foolish.

Accumulating points and redeeming cash rebates was a breeze, but since the Grab-Uber merger, it has clearly become more difficult to do so. Earlier this month, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) too said the merger deal has led to a \"substantial lessening of competition\", made it harder for new competitors to enter the market, and resulted in higher prices.   Indeed, the current situation has given pause to players such as Go-Jek who are reportedly reassessing the risks associated with entering this market. Thankfully the situation hasn’t deterred other players from breaking onto the scene.  MVL has just entered the market with its app, TADA. Among its selling points is that it will not collect commission fees from drivers using its platform, keep fares competitive, and not levy cancellation penalties on riders. This might give Grab a run for its money. However, some experts have pointed out that whether or not the Grab-Uber merger had taken place, prices would have increased. The low prices we had been seeing were merely unsustainable discounts the companies were offering in an effort to maximise their market share. It remains to be seen whether new players’ models are sustainable enough to ensure the longevity of their initial competitive rates. CONSUMERS HAVE CHOICES Soon after the Grab-Uber merger was announced, Nitin Pangarkar, Associate Professor in the Department of Strategy and Policy at the National University of Singapore Business School said that “we should not be unduly alarmed about the loss of consumer welfare because of high prices for the simple reason that there is a cap on how much the 'new Grab' can raise prices, especially in Singapore”. He pointed out that “Singapore has a good public transport system and a taxi system that doesn’t charge high fares”. Indeed, even though Grab is the largest player in the ride-hailing market today, consumers must remember they still have choices. Companies that operate in this sector also need to bear this in mind when increasing prices. Complacency clearly will not serve them in this market for long. TEMPERING UNSUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES Some observers have remarked that tech start-ups in the landscape could do more to temper their aggressive drive to attain market share through low prices. What we have seen transpire in Singapore and in China in the case of Didi Chuxing, clearly shows that when the focus turns to profitability, mergers may even become the norm. But whatever happened to building a sustainable business model from the get-go? However as things stand today, with any new player, consumers would do well to know that low prices and generous rewards are likely to be transitory. The vibrancy of free market economics would constitute quick entries, even exits and price adjustments. as all these occur. With higher prices, artificially-induced demand fuelled by low prices would fall and market shakeouts might then lead to an equilibrium. RESTORING CONTESTABILITY, BUT TO WHAT END? The CCCS has proposed remedies to restore market contestability in the ride-hailing landscape. Among them, the removal of exclusivity obligations, lock-in periods and/or termination fees on all drivers who drive on Grab’s ride-hailing platform and the removal of Grab’s exclusivity arrangements with any taxi or private-hire car fleet so as to increase choices for drivers and riders. Indeed, measures need to be in place to prevent existing players from making it arduous to sign up with new market entrants. New entrants would do better to step in with more creative business models that also take into account long-term sustainability. But while intense competition in the market might be good for consumers in the short-term, in the long-term, it leads to a less healthy transport ecosystem in that it is likely to thwart Singapore’s car-lite aims. A study by Boston’s Northeastern University shows that since private-hire services were introduced in Boston, commuters who used to walk, cycle or use public transport are opting for cheap private-hire car rides instead. In Singapore, as the bus and MRT systems continue to be improved, is encouraging the use of ride-hailing services really the answer? As regulators step in to ensure market contestability, the promotion of intense competition perhaps needs to be moderated, as do the expectations of commuters. In the meantime, we may have to adopt an attitude of \"enjoy it while it lasts\" when new entrants unleash generous discounts and \"suck it up\" when prices increase as players transition to more sustainable models or exit.

This year's parade will be held at the Floating Platform, but audiences will feel connected to the surrounding Marina Bay areas, thanks to its stage design. The backdrop of the stage is made up of swivel panels which, when opened, allows the audience to enjoy a clear view of the Marina Bay area. When they are closed, the audience will see a mural of Singapore’s iconic waterfront skyline. “This stage was designed with urban design principles in mind - the visual connection for the audience and the backdrop, as well as coherence of material and colours by putting the colours of the surrounding buildings on the stage,” said stage designer Quck Zhong Yi. Behind the spectator stands, there are 30 projectors that will beam films onto the panels. “It’s akin to back in the good old days when you go to an outdoor or drive-through cinema where you watch the film,” said chairman of the multimedia and communications committee for NDP 2018, Lieutenant-Colonel Chew Heng Hwa. “So we’re trying to create this nostalgic feeling among the crowd through a projection system on the swivel panels.” This year’s stage is also one of the highest in the history of the NDP and designed to ensure that spectators can watch performers on stage clearly.

SIA has reported year-on-year profit growth for three out of four quarters since it announced its three-year transformation plan in May last year. A steep rise in oil prices and a lack of one-off items, however, dragged its net profit in the fiscal first quarter this year down to S$139.6 million, versus a revised S$337.9 million in the previous year. “Good progress was achieved in the first year of the SIA Group’s three-year transformation programme,” SIA said in a stock exchange filing after market close. “The Group will continue to focus its efforts on initiatives to grow revenue, enhance customer experience and improve operational efficiency,” it added. Group revenue came in at S$3.84 billion, down 0.5 per cent from S$3.86 billion the previous year. During the quarter, fuel costs increased by S$154 million, due to a 39.3 per cent rise in the average jet fuel price. The group said in its outlook that it expects costs to remain under pressure, especially from higher fuel prices. Passenger traffic is expected to grow in the coming months, although competition in key operating markets persists. Cargo demand in the near term is steady, although any escalation of global trade tensions could potentially have a longer-term impact. SIA Group, like Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways, announced a three-year transformation programme in May last year, designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers. The announcement came after a surprise net loss of S$138 million in the fourth quarter ended March 2017 — its first loss in five years. As part of the transformation plan, SIA will absorb underperforming SilkAir into the parent brand after 2020, in a move that will better align the brands for travellers from long-haul destinations such as Europe and North America using Singapore as a connecting hub. SIA will resume the world’s longest commercial flights to New York on Oct 11 after a five-year hiatus, helping to close a gap in its US capacity relative to competitors like Cathay Pacific Airways and Emirates.

Teo Yan Kang, a Singapore permanent resident from Malaysia, also tried to molest two other women aged 30 and 23 in April and May. Teo, who was working as a McDonald's crew member at the time, molested the 12-year-old secondary school student at Jurong East Temporary Bus Interchange at around 3pm on Apr 16. The girl, who was wearing her school's Physical Education T-shirt, was heading towards a bus berth with a schoolmate. Teo molested the girl while walking past her; the victim heard him saying \"sorry\" twice. The victim and her friend went to the ticketing counter for help and were told to lodge a police report. HE TRIED TO MOLEST ANOTHER WOMAN THAT SAME DAY Later that same day, Teo took a bus and tried to molest a 23-year-old nurse who was on the upper deck. He touched the left side of her uniform, near her arm, with his finger. The woman informed the bus captain about the incident, while one of the passengers called the police.  Several weeks later, on the morning of May 21, Teo was involved in another molestation attempt. This time, at the void deck of Block 817, Jurong West Street 81, he tried to touch a 30-year-old woman's chest as he was walking towards her. The woman raised her arms to fend off Teo, who then ran away and stood at the side of the void deck. When the woman walked over and looked at him, Teo said: \"Please do not sue me.\" They ended up boarding the same bus and alighted at the same stop. The woman subsequently called the police. HE COMMITTED SIMILAR OFFENCE PREVIOUSLY Teo pleaded guilty to three charges of assault or use of criminal force on a person with the intent to outrage modesty. Deputy Public Prosecutor Michael Quilindo on Thursday said Teo had previously committed a similar offence with the same modus operandi. \"He knew she was a student as she was wearing a school uniform,\" said the prosecutor of the youngest victim. He added that Teo had committed the offences just months after he was released from prison in January this year for a similar offence. Teo, who has mild intellectual disability, pleaded for leniency, saying that his mother was alone at home and he needed to take care of her. Sentencing Teo to jail for 13 months, District Judge John Ng said: \"You will not be getting a light sentence, because you are repeating your offences.\" For assault with intent to outrage modesty, Teo could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of the three punishments.

The SFA, which will oversee food safety and security, will be set up under the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) in April next year. It will bring together food-related functions currently carried out by three other agencies - the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). Speaking to reporters on the sideline of a visit to The Soup Spoon on Thursday (Jul 26), Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said the SFA would better \"integrate\" the food industry. \"This will bring together various parts of these agencies to look at food from farm to fork and this will integrate the industry and as well as support them in order to take advantages that's available to our food industry.\" George Huang, chairman of the recently formed Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation (SAFEF), said the formation of SFA would better facilitate the process of farmers applying for various licenses. \"From the farmers' point of view, I think it is a very good move,\" said Mr Huang. \"Now we have an organisational body that covers the whole supply chain ... It will be much more efficient and support entrepreneurship much more.\" \"For example, Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) (currently) takes care of farm licenses, but if for example a fish farm wants to sell fish on the farm premises, it falls under retail, which is under the NEA.\" \"The issue is not getting the license - Singapore is quite efficient and so is the NEA. The thing is that the rules might not be totally aligned,\" added Mr Huang. \"One deals with farming and the other with retailing. There might be some grey areas or gaps in between.\" Jocelyn Chng, chief executive officer of JR Group Holdings, which operates restaurants and hot-food vending machines among others, agreed that the formation of the SFA would streamline the process of applying for the relevant licences. Currently, food retail businesses are licensed by the National Environment Agency (NEA), but those who wish to run a central kitchen require a different licence from the AVA.  \"It will be more efficient, because we don't need to go to two authorities or agencies to get clearance and approval,\" she added. \"With this one single agency, in terms of the regulations, the officers or the agency will be very clear in what they are offering. \"There's also more clarity. We know where to go and which agency to approach. Thirdly, we will also get better support, assuming there are licensing officers who know our businesses well, they will be able to support us better.\" The hope is that these changes would also lead to greater savings for companies such as JR Group, Ms Chng said. \"That will be a win-win for everyone,\" she added. While Mr Shannon Lim, who operates a fish farm off Lorong Halus, welcomed the announcement, he also hoped that SFA would be able to better allocate resources, including manpower to help local farmers. \"(It's a) good idea,\" said Mr Lim, explaining that the AVA was \"always stretched too thin\".  Mr Lim said that he has yet to receive a mandatory fish culture farm worker identification card for one of his employees, despite getting it approved in February. \"We tried to collect (it) at their office in June. They said it wasn’t ready yet,\" he added. \"A more focused agency should be able to allocate resources better.\" But apart from resource management, Mr Huang hopes that the SFA would help farmers in the export of their produce.  \"We have to increase Singapore's capabilities, such that our products are of international standards, that it is exportable - that's where you get a higher value of Singapore branding.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-singapore-food-agency-support-boost-efficiency-10564272"}, {"datetime": "26 Jul 2018 06:10PM", "tags": ["City Gas", "gas tariff"], "author": "", "title": "Household gas prices to go up from Aug to Oct", "content": " SINGAPORE: The gas tariff for households will increase by 3.78 per cent for the next three months, City Gas announced on Thursday (Jul 26).  The tariff will be raised from 18.53 cents per kWh to 19.23 cents per kWh from Aug 1 to Oct 31, the company said in a media release.  This is due to increase in fuel costs compared with the previous quarter, explained City Gas, which supplies town gas to nearly 90 per cent of residents in new housing board estates and private properties.

But he then went on to molest the woman, who cannot be named due to a gag order, and for this he was sentenced to five months' jail on Thursday (Jul 26). Court documents showed that on Jul 24 last year, Cheng, a 29-year-old accountant, drove to the woman's office that evening and picked her up.  He suggested that they head to Jurong Bird Park as it was near the woman's church, and she needed to go there later that night. While driving there, Cheng tickled his date's ear. He asked her if she felt uncomfortable with it, and she answered that she did not know as she had never had a boyfriend before. They arrived at Jurong Bird Park just before 6pm and got out of the car; and that's when the woman's ordeal started. Cheng started to hug the woman and touch her chest. He tried to touch her again elsewhere, but the woman stopped him and told him she was not comfortable with his actions. Cheng then hugged her and unbuckled her brassiere, before pulling the front of her dress towards him. The pair returned to Cheng's car sometime after 6pm. Outside the vehicle, Cheng molested the woman again. She then asked to be taken to the closest MRT station and Cheng took her to Jurong Point. The victim deleted the Coffee Meets Bagel app and blocked Cheng on WhatsApp. She lodged a police report the next day, saying that she was molested. On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Mark Yeo asked for a sentence of at least five months' jail, saying that Cheng had made several passes at the victim, even after she told him that she felt uncomfortable. The defence asked the judge to be as lenient as possible, saying that Cheng, who pleaded guilty, had offered his sincere apologies to the victim.

This sum will be disbursed through the National Monuments Fund, which was set up in 2008. Of the total sum, S$2 million will be used to co-fund restoration works at six monuments while S$113,000 will subsidise the maintenance of all 12 monuments. One monument which has received subsidies for both restoration and maintenance works is the 164-year-old Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple along Serangoon Road. “This funding ... is a good example of the partnership between the Preservation of Sites and Monuments division of NHB and the Hindu Endowments Board, in ensuring that the heritage we have inherited will be passed on to our future generations in a pristine condition,” said Mr Rajan Krishnan, chairman of the temple’s redevelopment committee. The temple received about S$88,000 to offset the cost of its restoration efforts, which included sculptural restoration on its five-tiered entrance tower. The painstaking process was carried out by eight skilled sculptors from India and took four months to complete. The temple’s inner sanctums were also re-tiled while the chipped granite floor at the main temple was replaced. The total cost of its restoration efforts, including other works not eligible for co-funding, was about S$700,000. The rest of the cost was covered through donations to the temple. SCOPE OF MAINTENANCE FUND EXPANDED Another first-time recipient of the restoration fund is the Church of St Teresa at Kampong Bahru Road. It will receive about S$1.3 million to offset its total restoration costs of about S$4.3 million. This comes after an investigation of structural defects - funded by the board’s maintenance fund - revealed several issues. For example, cracking on roof tiles has led to leakages, causing mould and obvious staining. There are also cracks on the building’s walls  - meaning that layers of decades-old paint will have to be stripped to examine if the faults are structural. Mr Joseph Silverayan, a parishioner at the church, said the funds are \"a boon\" as it has been 13 years since the last renovation. He said the restoration, slated for 2019, would create a “revival” by attracting more people to visit. The four other recipients of the restoration fund this year are the Al-Abrar Mosque, Chesed-El Synagogue, Maghain Aboth Synagogue and Thian Hock Keng temple. Maintenance funds will also be disbursed to the Armenian Church of St Gregory, Church of Saints Peter and Paul, Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery, St George's Church and St Joseph's Church. The scope of the maintenance fund was also expanded this year to include the \"maintenance of vegetation\" on or nearby monuments. Previously, only the removal of vegetation was qualified for co-funding. “With their (the stakeholders’) feedback, we have constantly expanded the scope of work that may be considered to be covered by the grant, so as to ensure it is user-friendly,” said Ms Jean Wee, director of the Preservation of Sites and Monuments at the NHB. Since its establishment in 2008, the fund has disbursed S$6.6 million for restoration and maintenance efforts. To qualify for funding, monuments must be owned and managed by a non-profit or religious organisation, accessible to the public, and able to finance the works before applying for subsidies. Of the 72 structures that have been gazetted as national monuments, 31 are eligible for the fund. Out of that, 27 have benefitted from it. \"I see the outcomes of the fund as a win-win situation: the community gets to worship at a restored or refreshed monument, and my team and I get a better understanding of the built material and the solutions that are tested, to ensure they will be well preserved for future generations,\" added Ms Wee.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nhb-to-give-s-2-1m-to-12-national-monuments-for-restoration-and-10564554"}, {"datetime": "26 Jul 2018 02:41PM", "tags": ["Forbes Rich List", "property"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore tycoons grew wealthier in 2018, new Forbes rich list reveals ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The very rich in Singapore have grown wealthier, according to the 2018 Forbes Singapore Rich List.

Wee, who was a taxi driver at the time, was travelling at a slow speed near Block 182A, Rivervale Crescent, court documents said. Mr Ow signalled his intention to overtake and sounded his horn a few times to alert Wee. Wee's vehicle stopped a few times and Mr Ow overtook him at a left turn into a slip road leading to a multi-storey car park. While Mr Ow drove past Wee, Wee gestured at him. He then followed Ow to the car park where he confronted the victim, asking why he had honked at him earlier. Mr Ow asked Wee why he had stopped his vehicle in front of his car. Wee then punched Mr Ow twice on his face. When Mr Ow turned and walked away, Wee punched him again, on the back of his head and on his back.

June’s jump continues an upward trend after manufacturing output increased by 12.9 per cent year-on-year in May. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, manufacturing output increased 3.9 per cent last month. On a three-month moving average basis, manufacturing output rose 10.2 per cent compared to a year ago.

Called TADA, which means \"let's ride\" in Korean, the on-demand point-to-point transportation service app was launched by Singapore-based company Mass Vehicle Ledger (MVL) Foundation on Thursday (Jul 26). The firm has already recruited 2,000 licensed private-hire car drivers ahead of its roll-out, according to founder and CEO Kay Woo who is from South Korea. MVL said it will not collect commission fees from drivers using its platform – a departure from other ride-hailing services, such as incumbent Grab, which charges a 20 per cent commission. Drivers will also not be bound by any exclusivity agreements, as well as acceptance and cancellation rates. Similarly for riders, there will not be any cancellation penalties while fares will be kept competitive.  “We don’t charge drivers any commission, so there’s room for lower prices. That’s how we share the benefits,” said Mr Woo in an interview with Channel NewsAsia ahead of the launch.  There will be two forms of pricing: A fixed-fare rate for point-to-point rides and metered pricing starting from a base fare of S$2.30. Meanwhile, a 3.4 per cent transaction fee will be charged for credit card payments.  MVL will also factor in surge pricing, although it is still surveying riders and drivers to determine a reasonable price range.  “We want to create a community where drivers and riders are treated as equal members. We don’t want to see them arguing over cancellations for instance,” said Mr Woo.  “If you don’t do well, there will be no incentives but if you do, you get more. By doing so, we hope to create a positive reinforcing environment.\"  These incentives will come in the form of points, which can be converted into MVL’s cryptocurrency called MVL coins.  For riders, these points will be given when they provide additional data into the system, such as writing reviews for their trips.  For drivers, points can be earned just by turning on the MVL app as they drive around. Those who receive better reviews and drive safely will also get more points.  These can eventually be used to redeem goods and services with MVL’s partners, said Mr Woo, though he remained tight-lipped about who they are, citing ongoing negotiations.  Users can also opt to cash out their MVL coins, the founder added. Listed on decentralised crypto exchange Idex, one MVL token last traded at US$0.005 on Thursday afternoon.  SHAKE UP MOBILITY INDUSTRY MVL raised around US$16 million (S$22 million) through its initial coin offering (ICO) earlier this year and has been using these funds to fuel its foray into Singapore.  Based out of an office at Oxley Bizhub in Ubi Road, the two-month-old start-up now has 36 employees. With operating costs remaining \"quite low\" for now, Mr Woo said its ICO proceeds will be sufficient to keep operations running.  Claiming to be a non-profit model, it stressed that it will not engage in a cash war to capture market share – a strategy that was previously adopted by ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber in Singapore until the latter was taken over by its Southeast Asian rival in March.  Instead, Mr Woo said he wants to grow MVL in an organic way and has a bigger aim to shake up the mobility industry by creating an ecosystem where there is transparent sharing of all mobility-related data, such as traffic conditions.  Apart from ride-hailing, it plans to integrate other key players within the industry, including used car services, auto insurers and even vehicle repair shops.  Its blockchain platform will track and gather data on all these vehicle activities, and with the consent of its users, the data might be sold to researchers or related transport companies for revenue in years to come, Mr Woo said.  “TADA is just one example of a service that runs on top of our blockchain protocol,\" he said. \"The app will have a similar user experience for both drivers and riders, but underneath, it is supported by blockchain technology that tracks and saves all the driving data.”  “For instance, traffic information collected during a trip is very useful and valuable to car makers of autonomous driving research companies,” added Mr Woo, who stressed that privacy data, such as the driver’s name for that trip, will be “concealed and separated”.  He also said that blockchain’s decentralised, immutable and transparent nature will make it more secure than a central database.  \"If you put all eggs in one basket, they just need to attack one basket but if you use blockchain, data is saved on distributed storage to protect the storage and ownership.\"  YAY OR NAY?  Given how there has been increasing adoption of blockchain across various industries, Mr Amit Zavery, executive vice president at Oracle Cloud Platform, told Channel NewsAsia that it is hardly surprising to see the technology being used by a ride-hailing player. He explained that the technology is well-suited for a system, such as a ride-hailing service, that runs on data across multiple parts of the supply chain involving various parties and types of transactions. The use of blockchain also yields other benefits, such as better security, the elimination of a middleman and scalability that allows any number of users to participate, added Mr Zavery. Nevertheless, experts said users of a ride-hailing app ultimately place more emphasis on the prices they pay for their trips, and how quickly they get matched to a commuter or driver.  Assistant Professor Terence Fan from the Singapore Management University said: \"Using the blockchain technology may not make it easier to break into the market because this is part of its internal operations. It’s something that neither the ride hailers nor ride providers can see or feel.\"  While the recruitment of 2,000 drivers is an “encouraging starting point”, Assoc Prof Fan wondered how that relates to the number of cars that will be available at any one time, which affects the time needed to match a driver to a commuter.  The transport specialist also questioned if the elimination of a middleman means a lack of a feedback channel for users.  \"Quality matters at the end of the day. People could be open to trying out alternatives but the question of whether they are going to keep trying remains,\" he told Channel NewsAsia. GIVING RIDERS AN ALTERNATIVE Despite going up against incumbent Grab and a handful of new players such as Ryde, Mr Woo was confident that MVL's zero commission fee can help it to attract at least 3,000 drivers next month and 10,000 by the end of the year. It is also in talks with one taxi company and other car rental firms to boost its fleet.  On whether it is confident of attracting riders, particularly given the niche user adoption of cryptocurrencies in Singapore, Mr Woo acknowledged that this would be a “harder challenge” and plans to work with other participants within the blockchain community.  A potential challenge could also come in the form of higher prices on its app during non-peak hours as it works to stabilise its pricing mechanism, he added.  \"But we are not going to spend tons of money on promotions. That's not the way to compete with the giants who have much more resources; that's the fast way to kill yourself.\"  Mr Woo said: \"We are here to offer an alternative choice to the Singapore community ... If there is a way to work with existing players, be it the giants or new players, we are open to that.\"  One private-hire car driver that decided to give MVL a shot is Mr Lee Seng Leong. The 54-year-old, who has been a full-time driver with Grab for more a year, listed the zero commission fee as the most important factor. While the cryptocurrency reward system sounds like a plus point, it remains a \"complicated\" concept for him at the moment.  \"If prices are about the same, we will earn more (if there’s a zero commission fee). Being a driver is all about the money and whichever app is better, I'll go for it.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tada-new-ride-hailing-app-drivers-zero-commission-10564068"}, {"datetime": "26 Jul 2018 11:32AM", "tags": ["animals", "Woodlands Checkpoint", "ICA"], "author": "", "title": "Man caught with 92 fighting fish at Woodlands Checkpoint", "content": " SINGAPORE: Ninety-two fighting fish were found hidden in a car at Woodlands Checkpoint last Friday, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Jul 25).  The fish, packed in individual plastic bags, were kept in the boot, the centre console and in a bag that was placed on a floor mat of the front passenger's seat.

Formed in response to challenges posed by the global food landscape and climate change, SFA will manage food safety, hygiene regulations and address issues of food supply. SFA aims to “enhance regulatory oversight from farm to fork”, the release added. A National Centre for Food Science will also be established under SFA, consolidating the food laboratory capabilities of the three agencies. “Safeguarding Singapore’s food supply is increasingly challenging due to the complexities of global food supply chains as well as the impacts of climate change,” said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli in the press release.  “We are already seeing the effects of climate change, such as plankton blooms from warmer sea waters and increasingly erratic rainfall patterns. The formation of the SFA is timely as Singapore aims to turn our food challenges into strategic advantages.” “The SFA will work closely with industry and R&D partners to develop new solutions and products, and seize global opportunities in the food industry,” added Mr Masagos.  “Doing this will help make our food supply future-ready and provide good jobs for Singaporeans in the food industry.” The SFA will also aim to streamline licensing standards for food businesses, including farmers, food manufacturers, food retailers and food service operators. Mr Lim Kok Thai, chief executive officer of AVA, will be concurrently appointed as the chief executive officer (designate) of SFA. NPARKS TO BE LEAD AGENCY FOR ANIMAL AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT In addition, under the Government’s reorganisation of its food, plant health and animal management functions, all non-food plant and animal-related functions of the AVA will be transferred to the National Parks Board (NParks). This will allow NParks to provide a one-stop service on animal management and welfare issues, manage “human-animal interactions”, and improve the detection and response to animal diseases which can be transmitted to humans, said the press release. “With NParks as the lead agency for animal and wildlife management, as well as animal and plant health, we will work more closely with stakeholders to develop a science-based management approach, with holistic strategies and more effective responses,” said Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee. A new Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) will be created under NParks and take on the AVA’s role as first responder for animal-related feedback, as well as maintaining standards in animal welfare and health. When the changes take effect on Apr 1, 2019, AVA, which was formed in 2000, will be dissolved. The reorganisation will see about 1,150 employees redeployed from the AVA, NEA and HSA. About 850 staff from the three agencies will be transferred to SFA.

By the end of July, 20 of Singapore's busiest MRT stations - including Yishun and Ang Mo Kio stations - will have posters presenting location-specific data on the most congested travel timings as well as alternative bus routes, LTA announced on Thursday (Jul 26). The posters will be put up at nine North-South Line stations, six East-West Line stations, four stations on the North-East Line and one station on the Downtown Line.  This is one of the initiatives under the Travel Smart programme. Another initiative is the Travel Smart Network of companies that adopt flexi-hours and encourage employees to use alternative modes of transport such as cycling. Since August 2014, 220 organisations and 360,000 employees have joined the network. Companies can tap on a Travel Smart grant to help them modify their workplaces to encourage workers to travel off-peak. For example, Edmund Tie & Co used the grant last year to install a door access system, so that employees have the option of coming to work before 8am. The Differential Fares Scheme was also launched in December last year, which gives S$0.50 discounts to commuters who travel before 7.45am. A total of 325,000 commuters benefit from the scheme daily – an 8 per cent increase from the number of commuters who took trains in the early off-peak hours in 2017. As commuter needs evolve, programmes and initiatives need to be updated, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary on Thursday. Technology and incentives should be used where possible to encourage commuters to make the best use of the public transport network, he added. \"(This will) help ourselves be better commuters and have a better experience for everybody,\" said Dr Puthucheary. \n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lta-mrt-station-smart-travel-information-yishun-ang-mo-kio-10563712"}, {"datetime": "26 Jul 2018 09:09AM", "tags": ["Little India", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "7 men arrested over Serangoon Road slashing incident", "content": " SINGAPORE: Seven Singaporean men were arrested on Thursday (Jul 26) over an attack on a 27-year-old man in Little India.  The suspects, aged 17 to 28, were arrested near Corporation Road and Block 26 Sin Ming Industrial Estate, the police said.  The incident took place at about 2.20pm on Wednesday at 202 Serangoon Road.

One industry observer told Channel NewsAsia that the real problem lies with poor waste management systems in countries that leak huge amounts of garbage into the ocean. “The best that can be said about the collective actions to eliminate straws is that it’s good at raising awareness, but that’s not the solution,” said Mr Steven Russell, plastics division vice president at the American Chemistry Council, which represents multi-national chemical and plastic manufacturers. Mr Russell was in Singapore earlier in July to meet with waste companies, plastic companies and consumer brands on working together to solve global waste management problems. The anti-plastic straw movement is believed to have taken off in 2015, after a video showing a sea turtle with a straw stuck up its nose went viral. Soon enough it spread globally, with cities like Seattle and Mumbai and companies like Starbucks and Ikea ditching the eco-unfriendly straws.  In Singapore it is no different: KFC is just one in a growing list that includes Millennium Hotels and Common Man Coffee Roasters to have signed up. “If you have eyes, you see the images,” Mr Russell said. “Everybody feels understandably compelled to act, so the impulse to reduce what we use is a good one.” “ENVIRONMENTAL MALPRACTICE” So, what exactly is the problem with the movement? Mr Russell feels it could lull companies and individuals into thinking they’ve done enough to save the ocean, given the relatively short attention such issues get. “It would be a shame to think we’ve banned straws – we’re done,” he said, dusting off his hands. “That would be environmental malpractice to address only 0.2 per cent of the waste stream. We’re not helping the ocean.” In a recent report on science website phys.org, a pair of Australian scientists estimated that there are up to 8.3 billion plastic straws strewn across coastlines around the world. Seems like a big number, but even if all those straws were suddenly swept to sea, they would only make up less than 1 per cent of the 8 million tonnes of plastic estimated to enter the ocean in a given year. (Plastics make up about 80 per cent of marine litter.) This whopping figure, derived in a 2015 study published in the journal Science, is equivalent to five normal-sized plastic bags filled with plastic entering the ocean along every 0.5m of coastline in the world. “The only thing that is going to help the ocean is getting serious about managing waste in places where it’s not managed,” Mr Russell added. UNCOLLECTED WASTE These places are likely to be middle-income countries with rapidly growing economies, the study noted, as they lack the waste management systems to handle all that extra waste. China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka were ranked as the top five producers – out of 192 countries – of mismanaged plastic waste in 2010. This was based on an analysis of people living within 50km of the coast. Mismanaged plastic waste refers to trash that can possibly enter the ocean. “If people in those places aren’t served by waste collection, if they don’t have a place to put their used things, these fall from their hands to the ground, river and ocean,” Mr Russell explained, highlighting the growing consumer class in such countries. In this respect, Singapore fares much better. The city-state produced about 6,500 tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste in 2010, coming in at 114th. (China generated almost 9 million tonnes.) For countries that need help, Mr Russell said an upcoming initiative will see consumer brands set up a fund and offer low to no-interest loans to help communities in Asia improve their waste management. This model is similar to the Closed Loop Fund in North America. The loans can be used to purchase new garbage bins or invest in recycling technology, for instance. “That model is being adapted for an Asian context with a focus on Indonesia and perhaps India,” Mr Russell said, adding that the initiative will be announced in October at the Our Ocean Conference in Bali. FISHING GEAR While Mr Russell might be speaking as an interested party, his argument is shared by more neutral observers. Bloomberg columnist Adam Minter wrote that “straws make up a trifling percentage of the world's plastic products, and campaigns to eliminate them will not only be ineffective, but could distract from far more useful efforts”. The movement, he argued, should instead pressure global seafood companies to mark their fishing nets and gear, which studies said make up a good chunk of plastic garbage in the ocean. This holds a person or company accountable when the gear is abandoned. Ms Olivia Choong, who co-founded the environmental group Green Drinks Singapore, said the current movement is “not effective in removing marine litter because straws are only one of many things that make it to the marine environment”. “Plastic bags, Styrofoam boxes and cigarette butts are some common things found at beaches,” she said. “Sometimes slippers too.” Nevertheless, Ms Choong added that plastic straws are a “good starting point” when it comes to reducing single-use plastics. “FIRST STEP” Plastic-Lite Singapore founder Aarti Giri agreed, saying the movement is a “great first step in the right direction”. Noting that plastic straws are among the top 10 items littered along beaches and waterways, she said cutting down on them “will definitely help” reduce plastic gunk in the ocean and its harmful effects on marine life. “Anti-straw movements have a larger effect of creating awareness in the minds of consumers on the overall negative environmental impact of disposable plastics, not just straws,\" she added. “They also help in reducing the number of disposable plastic straws used in Singapore on a day-to-day basis, which also has a positive overall environmental impact from (saving) the energy and material resources used in the manufacturing and logistics of these straws.\" Still, Ms Giri called for the effectiveness of such campaigns to be measured using studies with statistical data. “I sincerely hope for this movement to be a progressive one and not one that terminates at plastic straws,” she stated. WHAT YOU CAN DO Short of starting a campaign to mark fishing gear or improve trash collection in Indonesia, what else can you do to stop marine pollution? Ms Giri said taking part in beach clean-ups can help raise awareness on plastic pollution and develop a fondness for the environment. But this should translate to behavioural changes, like bringing your own bag and bottle when going out. “If we cannot transfer this awareness towards being able to reduce usage of the plastics we litter pick, it will not have a positive difference,” she added. In particular, Ms Giri said to avoid Styrofoam containers as they are light and easily washed into the sea. They also break up easily, making it tedious to pick up during beach clean-ups. And then there’s the obvious. Don’t litter, said Ms Choong, especially at the beach. “There is so much trash that can be found on our shores, brought in through water currents from somewhere else, or generated by residents,” she added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/skipping-plastic-straws-might-not-stop-marine-pollution-10555340"}, {"datetime": "26 Jul 2018 06:40AM", "tags": ["employment", "labour", "expat", "salary", "work", "hiring"], "author": "Roy Chua", "title": "Commentary: Expats have an edge over locals. Here's why", "content": " SINGAPORE: Michael, a successful Singaporean senior executive at a global investment bank, got passed over for a promotion for which he believed he was more than qualified.  That dream job went to an Australian expatriate from the bank’s headquarters.  Leong, a young local manager at a global resort and hotel chain, couldn't break into the inner circles of his Western expatriate bosses. He felt that without good personal relationships with these bosses, it would be hard for him to make much headway at the company. Local professionals and managers working for foreign multinational companies complain about this sort of thing all the time. Each hiring and promotion decision is of course unique and involves idiosyncratic considerations. Nevertheless, many people believe foreigners often have an edge over locals in the hiring and promotion process.  Recent observations suggest that many global companies promote through internal transfers – it is not so much that these companies prefer expatriates over locals, but that foreign firms expanding in Singapore are simply bringing in staff from elsewhere.  But why do multinational corporations do this? There are several reasons.  INTERNAL STAFFERS ARE MORE EXPERIENCED First, internal staffers tend to have a good grasp of the company’s DNA – its culture and how it operates. For a global firm, such internal staffers also have extensive experiences working for the company around the world.  Second, experienced internal staffers, especially those from headquarters, probably have an extensive social network throughout the worldwide operations that helps them to get things done. That is an advantage that a Singaporean manager who rose through the ranks locally is unlikely to be able to match. Third, global companies often systematically develop the international experiences of their high-potential employees by posting them overseas. Hence, it is totally legitimate and reasonable for a US company to post an American executive to Singapore to get experience in Asia.  Executives such as Michael often overlook these considerations and presume they are passed over because of bias against locals. In reality, companies simply make personnel decisions that managers see as being best for the organisation. If foreign companies transfer staff from headquarters and elsewhere to Singapore for the sake of effectiveness, how should we put this practice in perspective?  Importantly, what can local executives do to increase their chances of being hired or promoted by foreign employers?  BRINGING IN EXPATS CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR LOCALS The practice of bringing expatriate employees into Singapore, while often seen as increasing competition for locals, has the frequently overlooked advantage of developing locals themselves.   Research shows that a multicultural workplace and exposure to foreign cultures make people more creative. Foreign values, practices, and norms in viewing the world and problem-solving can help locals develop a more complex and sophisticated view of the issues they confront.  Ideas and perspectives from around the world can also be harnessed to formulate new ideas and solutions locally.  In one of my research works, I found that professionals whose networks comprise people from diverse cultures are more creative at solving global business problems than those whose networks are culturally homogeneous.  As businesses become increasingly globalised, a global perspective and multicultural social network developed through interactions with expatriates can help local executives become more competitive in the job market.  More broadly speaking, the influx of foreigners into local society can make Singaporeans who work with them more creative, a prized asset in today’s workplace.  LOCALS LACK SOFT SKILLS  Besides embracing and harnessing the cultural diversity that expatriates bring to the local workforce, Singaporean executives should also consider developing their own soft skills such as communication, negotiation, leadership and network-building. Employers often observe that Singaporean graduates are strong in technical competence but less adept in people skills. In a 2016 speech, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung shared some feedback he received frequently from industry leaders:  Singapore graduates know a lot of stuff, but those can be learnt on the job. What’s more important are the practical and soft skills that can help them excel at the workplace. Such skills are especially important in a global workplace where one must interact with colleagues with viewpoints and values that can be vastly different from one’s own. To thrive in a global firm, employees need to be able to communicate across cultures, make persuasive arguments, and perhaps even engage in self-promotion.  Young managers such as Leong might be equipped with the hard skills that our education system nurtured in our youths – but success in the practical world demands more than that.  The further one goes in one’s career, the more important soft skills become. When managing a group of people, one is no longer doing the technical work, but getting work done through others.  The ability to motivate, influence and persuade others becomes critical.   TECHNICAL SKILLS ARE NOT ENOUGH Moreover, in a competitive global environment with many foreign talents vying for the same job, the ability to promote one's self helps.  Western expatriates may be more effective than locals because of cultural differences and exposure to education systems that emphasise soft skills and self-promotion.  Thus, it is little wonder that in a business world where soft skills are prized and competition is stiff, local employees sometimes feel handicapped and frustrated that top jobs go to foreigners – who, in their eyes may not be as technically capable as themselves.  They may be disappointed, but they are learning an important lesson: In the modern corporate world, technical skills are not enough.

She pointed at her mulberry plant, proclaiming that “the leaves can be used to make tea, which is good for you”. Next, she plucked a bunch of six-petal chive flowers and thrust them under a guest’s nose. “Taste it. You can eat it raw,” insisted the 75-year-old. It tasted both sweet and garlicky. “Nice, right?” she asked. Minutes later, in her kitchen, she bossed her guests about, ordering one to peel the potatoes and another to squeeze grated coconut. These paying guests were attending one of her cooking classes at her terrace house, learning how to make chicken curry as part of Airbnb Experiences, a platform where locals get to share their hobbies or skills for a fee. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Almost everything was created from scratch to make that dish, from extracting the coconut milk to plucking chilli, ginger and lemongrass from the garden to make curry paste. It took Mdm Ng’s eldest son a year to coax her out of retirement to help reinvent her family home of almost 50 years, now called One Kind House, and recreate the good old kampung days for others. A primary school teacher for 40 years before she retired over 15 years ago, she has now become part historian, part businesswoman while bringing back the kampung spirit. GATE ALWAYS OPENED Mr Calvin Soh, a regional executive director of an advertising firm, had always wanted his mother to share with others, especially children, the history of the house and of Singapore as well as her recipes before they get forgotten. Which is why the gate leading to Mdm Ng’s house at Telok Kurau is now kept unlocked. She welcomes all, not minding the security risk. “The more you want to close the door, the more curious the robber gets,” she reasoned. “We have no valuables, only paintings. They’re so big – how to cart them away?” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Strangers have strolled uninvited past her gates to inspect her plants, while children have chased butterflies into her garden. But by and large, Singaporeans are a polite bunch and would gesture to her from the main gate to ask whether they can enter. From the exterior, her double-storey house seems stuck in the 1960s, with its art deco air vents set against a light turquoise facade. Sandwiched between its contemporarily designed neighbours, it looks like an oddity. The interior has become a living museum, and Mdm Ng, known more affectionately as Mummy Soh, showcases items from the past to children. These include an iron heated by charcoal, a black and white picture of her wedding with her late husband, and a cast-iron Singer sewing machine well over 100 years old. It was her mother’s and still works, she said. Apart from her cooking classes for Airbnb Experiences, which attracts mainly tourists (at S$99 a person), she hosts dinners about twice a week, in a kitchen-cum-dining area that seats nearly 20. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A BUZZING HOUSEHOLD Three years ago, however, life could not have been more different for Mummy Soh. She was on the verge of retiring to another country with a cooler climate and ample greenery, like Australia, New Zealand or Thailand’s Chiang Mai. She had been spending her retirement years travelling, exploring Singapore and taking care of her two grandchildren. But after they went to school, there was less for her to do, said her son. She wanted to sell the house, which has seen four generations living under the same roof. But Mr Soh persuaded her otherwise. “I said, ‘It’s your house; you can do whatever you want with it.’ But I thought it was such a shame because the house wasn’t just a physical structure, it also contained all the memories and stories and sort of a legacy,” said the 50-year-old. His grandparents bought it in 1969, and he remembers growing up with six uncles and five aunties in a household always abuzz with activities. His grandfather was the sole breadwinner, and although they had the house, they were not rich. “I think that’s where the seed of creativity started because my grandmother could do a lot with very little. She could reconfigure leftovers and make them taste different the next day,” recalled Mr Soh. “We were very frugal.” Dinners were quick affairs for the big group and had to be done in two sittings. He said: The more you talked, the less food there was on the table. So everyone ate and went off. But the house was filled with love and community spirit, he added. They reared chickens, grew vegetables and even arranged for a farmer to collect their leftovers, to feed his pigs, in return for eggs every few months. The house was next to kampungs with Malays, Eurasians and Chinese all living in one neighbourhood. The mothers would gather and exchange recipes while the children made friends and wandered around the kampungs, with their friendly, open-door policy. “We looked out for one another, and you could go to the neighbour’s house to ask, ‘What did you cook for lunch?’ And the makcik (auntie) would say, ‘Oh, today I cooked nasi lemak. Bring your plate,’” Mr Soh said with a smile. “It might be 20 cents, or we might return the favour the next time round.” REINVENTING THE HOUSE After his grandparents died in the 1980s, Mummy Soh ran the household, as she was the eldest. Her mother had insisted that she buy the house so the proceeds could be distributed to her siblings. She and her husband, who had moved to a public flat about 10 years earlier, sold it to return to the house. Their eldest son was 22 then. He bought his own place in his 30s and later invited Mummy Soh to live with him, to help look after his children. His younger brother and an uncle live in One Kind House now. Despite all the memories, Mummy Soh eventually saw little reason to keep the house, as almost all her siblings had moved out. “I might as well sell it,” she reasoned. “I need to spend my own money, right? I could go travelling or whatever, right? All my life I'd been working.” That was when Mr Soh suggested reinventing the house, which would “enable my mum to sort of find dignity, purpose and something to do, and then find a way to connect with kids”. And if that failed, she could still sell it. His idea was to create a community centre of sorts, where the young and old could exchange skills and ideas, where there would be a sense of collaboration like in the good old days. “The old would get to pass on a lot of their traditions and knowledge, and we shouldn’t lose track of that,” he said. “For the kids, they should learn that and understand where it came from; they’d also be able to project it going forward and evolve it into their own version of themselves.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using food, he reckoned, would be a “fantastic way of figuring out one’s past”. It took a year of convincing, but Mummy Soh then started out by hosting dinners, for family and friends first. “It was out of her comfort zone. She was always in a secure place where she was in a job with a chart and a trajectory plotted out for her,” explained Mr Soh. When she finally decided to take on the project, she thought that she would “just go with the flow”. “Then it became more complex, and then everybody liked it, and it just started,” she said. “They tasted the food, they liked it and from there his friends went to his other friends, so it was by word of mouth.” A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE Recreating that kampung feel, however, did not come cheap. Mr Soh spent about S$300,000 breaking down the walls to create an open concept, raising the ceilings to emphasise the kitchen’s importance and making the garden self-sufficient. His mother bought fresh ingredients from the market and conducted the classes. To her surprise, some of the participants had only seen spice packets and packaged coconut milk, but not spices in their natural form or how coconut milk was made. “Then when they fry the spices, they say, ‘Oh, the smell of the ingredients comes out,’” she said. Many have also told her that her food reminded them of their childhood. “A lot told me that they missed their home-cooked food. Nowadays, when they’re working, they always get food from outside, or they go to a restaurant. It’s a different kind of atmosphere,” she said. WATCH: Inside the experience (5:09)  By chance, an Airbnb employee attended one of the dinners and recommended that she list her services with Airbnb Experiences, launched in Singapore last year. Mummy Soh now offers a three-course meal, which includes dishes like roast chicken, Teochew-style steamed fish, Assam prawns and blue-pea flower rice. Many tourists have told her it was the first time they had stepped into a person’s home in Singapore and got to appreciate the decor, a step up from simply taking pictures of the Peranakan shophouses along Koon Seng Road. “They don't know what's inside (those houses). Can they see how many rooms (there are)? Can they see the structure inside? So it’s a different kind of experience (here). They like it,” she said. She appreciates the interaction with the tourists and the exchange of ideas – about food, plants and even how to create compost. One Australian group was so impressed with her salted-vegetable duck soup that they requested her recipe. It is not the money that keeps her going, she said. I do it more for fun and the passion. It's about meeting people and talking. You’d feel better. Positive reviews aside, she has received some brickbats from neighbours who were unhappy with the increased noise and traffic and who complained to the Urban Redevelopment Authority. In 2016, the authority found that the house fulfilled the rules on home-based small businesses, except for operating a small cafe for the public, which has since been stopped, she said. Her son found some of the complaints odd, as most of the tourists who visited did not drive, using taxis or private-hire cars instead. “I’m very used to dealing with objections and roadblocks,” he said. “When you come up with something new, you have to deal with the loneliness of shepherding something through. The initial process is always dangerous, difficult and unknown.” INCUBATOR FOR IDEAS More than just a venture for his mum, the house has also become an incubator for ideas for Mr Soh’s daughter Ava, 12, and son Dylan, 15. They work on their projects in one of the rooms upstairs. Ava is a national skater who has started to sew pants for sale, at S$49 each. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Her brother gives motivational talks, has launched a few Kickstarter campaigns with his dad and is now developing an app for adults to discover their inner child. The boy feels deeply connected to the house, as generations of his family have lived there. He helps Mummy Soh regularly, tending to the garden, taking the guests on tours round the house and even helping to make kedondong (a tropical fruit) pesto sauce when he is free. “(This house) inspires me to be a start-up of my own because no one’s really doing this,” he said. “I’m not stigmatised by failure. In terms of my projects, there’s no failure, but there are setbacks. But eventually, I’ll experience failure and will have to learn from that.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To give back to the community, the family have conducted cooking classes for children of single parents and other activities for those with mental disabilities, said Mr Soh. However, he sees the house as having had the greatest effect on his mother, who has become more active. The exposure to different cultures as she made friends with some visitors, bonding over the meals, has also been invaluable. As a teacher all her working life, she had never been entrepreneurial nor thought starting a business could ever be possible for her, said Mr Soh. “But like I said, Singapore itself is a start-up. It’s in our genes. So once she had a taste, it came to her naturally. It was as if all the circuits connected. And she was like, ‘Yeah, I can do all these things,’” he added. Suddenly she was Miss Businesswoman. Mummy Soh admitted that opening up the house did wonders for her: She feels “healthier and happier or funnier”. She is not planning, however, to do these dinners and cooking lessons for long. And she still wants to sell the house while she is alive, to avoid any possible conflict over the house in future. “As long as my health is okay, I can continue. If I find it too tiring, I’d just have to stop,” she said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/one-kind-house-mummy-soh-75-ng-swee-hiah-airbnb-experiences-10563004"}, {"datetime": "26 Jul 2018 12:12AM", "tags": ["Cyberattack"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore investor watchdog uncovers personal data breach from 2013; 70,000 members hit", "content": " SINGAPORE: About 70,000 members of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) had their personal particulars illegally accessed and copied in 2013, though the data breach was only uncovered recently.  The investor watchdog said in an email to its members that the breach had come to its attention only on Wednesday (Jul 25).  The email, signed off by SIAS general manager Richard Dyason, said the association’s membership database was “breached and leaked” five years ago, resulting in names, NRIC numbers and telephone numbers of affected members being “illegally accessed and copied”.  However, “no records were amended or deleted”, it added.  When contacted, SIAS president David Gerald said the investor watchdog was notified of the breach by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) on Wednesday morning.  As investigations into the breach get underway, SIAS said it is “taking active steps to prevent any further illegal access”.  A new website will be launched in a few days and to “limit any potential threat”, it has temporarily taken down its website in the meantime. \"We sincerely apologise for the service disruption and for any distress that the breached may have caused,\" it added in the email.

This is despite a major global reconfiguration of what a young person needs to learn and when, in order to satisfy the need for this lifelong learning. Mr Ong said: “I hope tonight, we don't end up trying to redesign the education system. It has been painstakingly built up and is good in many aspects.” “There must be joy in learning and sustained curiosity. Without it, we cannot be motivated to learn, keep up or stay ahead of changes,” he added. Mr Ong said a shift in the education system is needed but trade-offs and tensions are inevitable. He added that Singapore must make the necessary adjustments to further improve the quality of the education system, so it remains strong and instils the joy of learning in the young. While the public might debate about whether it is an academic degree or skills that will help the young chart their path towards success, Mr Ong said: “The difficult question we should really ask is: Does a young person necessarily need a degree in order to do well in his or her career? The answer is ‘it depends’.” While a degree certainly helps open doors, especially in Singapore where universities are well-regarded, he stressed that employers are increasingly looking beyond academic qualifications in hiring and promoting staff. “They are looking for demonstrated skills and competencies. Not just qualifications that suggest that a person may possess those skills and competencies. It may take a while for this human resource approach to be truly widespread. But the macro trends are clear.” INEQUALITY REMAINS A “COMPLEX ISSUE” Mr Ong also spoke about inequality, saying it remains a “complex issue, with inherent paradoxes” and, as such, Singapore must continue to step up efforts in addressing the opportunity gaps that arise from it. He said one way to tackle inequality would be for Singapore to have faith in meritocracy, where talent and ability are recognised over wealth and circumstances of birth. Mr Ong said education also acts as a social integrator since all students share the same educational experience, considering that they all attend national schools in Singapore. He added that education plays the role of leveler in the social landscape, since it provides all students with the \"same keys\" to access various opportunities. Mr Ong said the aim is to uplift more poor families, so that their challenges are not translated to their children’s performances in school. “It may take a generation for the concept and our effort to evolve and mature, but the journey has begun,” he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lifelong-learning-necessary-education-ong-ye-kung-10562620"}, {"datetime": "25 Jul 2018 09:29PM", "tags": [], "author": "Noella Chye", "title": "Four members of the public honoured for catching upskirt video suspects", "content": " SINGAPORE: “You’ll never know if the next victim is from your own family.\" For Mr Song Wei Zong, 35, that was the reason he decided to help two others detain a man who was believed to have taken an upskirt video of a woman. Mr Leow Fa Dong, 25, and Ms Crystal Tan Yi Jing, 20, were on the escalator at Tampines MRT station on Jul 2 when they noticed the 51-year-old suspect placing his phone under the skirt of a woman.  Ms Tan alerted the victim while Mr Leow tried to detain the suspect. There was a struggle as the suspect tried to get away. The commotion attracted the attention of Mr Song who helped to detain the suspect. Officers from the Public Transport Security Command (PTSC) who responded to the incident later found upskirt videos in the 51-year-old suspect's phone.  “I didn’t think too much about whether it was the right thing to do,” Mr Song said, adding that he also did not consider how the situation would play out and whether he would get hurt. All three received the Public Spiritedness Award along with Mr Justin Law, 25, who was commended for his actions in a separate incident. Mr Law was at Marymount MRT station on Jul 19 when he noticed a 46-year-old male suspect standing just behind a female victim on an escalator. The suspect first caught his eye when he noticed his phone was placed at a “weird angle”, close to the victim. Upon looking more closely, he realised that the victim was being filmed. When confronted, the suspect denied filming the victim. But Mr Law said that he saw him attempting to delete some pictures. When the police arrived later, no images of the victim were found, but they discovered several others. Speaking at the awards ceremony at the PTSC headquarters on Wednesday (Jul 25), Mr Law said: “He didn’t seem like he would run. He seemed really nervous. His fingers were trembling. That’s when I knew it was his first time getting caught.”  Both suspects are now under investigation for insulting the victims’ modesty. PTSC Commander Koh Wei Keong said: “We need to work very closely with the community to fight crime, and we must take the opportunity to recognise such acts, hopefully to encourage people in terms of public spiritedness.” Mr Leow said: “If I had done nothing, it’s guaranteed (the suspect) would have gotten away, and there would have been another victim, so there’s really no reason not to do something.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/public-spiritedness-award-catching-upskirt-video-suspects-10561754"}, {"datetime": "25 Jul 2018 08:46PM", "tags": ["Trending", "Dining", "Michelin Guide Singapore"], "author": "Genevieve Sarah Loh", "title": "Michelin Guide Singapore 2018: New Michelin star restaurants revealed ", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos  SINGAPORE: Once again reigniting the passionate debate between gastronomes and local hawker fans, the 2018 Singapore Michelin Star list was announced on Wednesday night (Jul 25), as the third edition of the Michelin Guide Singapore was launched.  With Joel Robuchon Restaurant - Singapore’s only three Michelin-star restaurant - bidding our island-city adieu last month, there was a massive hole to be filled. But in the end, no establishment claimed the elusive spot. Five new eateries received their very first one-star accolade, including Chef Ivan Brehm’s Nouri, Chef Tomoo Kimura’s Sushi Kimura, modern Australian Burnt Ends, Four Seasons Hotel’s Jiang-Nan Chun and French gastro-bar Ma Cuisine. Keeping their coveted star were the two fan favourite Singaporean hawker stalls - Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle. They made history back in 2016 when they garnered one Michelin star each, positioning Singapore as the official home of the world's cheapest Michelin-starred meal. Eighteen-year-old Singapore stalwart restaurant Saint Pierre by chef-owner Emmanuel Stroobant, Cheek By Jowl by Sri Lanka-born and Tetsuya-trained Rishi Naleendra, as well as modern Singaporean restaurant Labyrinth by Singaporean chef Han Li Guang and Chef Malcom Lee’s Candlenut, the world's first Peranakan restaurant with a Michelin star, all retained their star for the second year running. Osia Steak and Seafood Grill at Resorts World Sentosa was dropped from the one-star list. There were several vacancies on the list of two-star eateries this year, what with Restaurant Andre and L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon both shuttering in February and June respectively. However, no other restaurant rose to the challenge to join the likes of Les Amis, Odette, Shisen Hanten, Shoukouwa and Waku Ghin, resulting in the two Michelin star list remaining unchanged with no new entrants. Odette chef-owner Julien Royer told CNA Lifestyle that \"it's sad for Singapore\" that there's no longer any three Michelin star restaurants. \"But it leaves some room for the future,\" he said. \"And I'm confident and I hope there will be some three star restaurants next year.\" Does he think he's a contender? \"Everyone is a contender,\" replied Royer. \"Every good restaurant here is a contender.\" Here's the official Michelin Guide Singapore 2018:  ONE MICHELIN STAR RECIPIENTS New entrants: Alma by Juan Amador Bacchanalia Braci Beni Candlenut Cheek By Jowl Chef Kang's Corner House Cut Crystal Jade Golden Palace Garibaldi Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle Iggy's Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine Jaan Labyrinth Lei Garden Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle Meta Putien (Kitchener Road) Rhubarb Saint Pierre Shinji by Kanesaka (Bras Basah Rd) Shinji by Kanesaka (Tanglin Road) Summer Palace Summer Pavilion Sushi Ichi The Song of India Whitegrass TWO MICHELIN STAR RECIPIENTS There are no new entrants in this category this year.

Having dropped out of school when she was in Secondary 1, she found it challenging to get accustomed to the books again. She also had problems dealing with her emotions. Fast forward 12 months later, Nora had not only passed her N-Levels, she is even working towards taking the O-Levels at the end of the year. Nora attributed her achievements to the programmes and support she received at Institution A4 (formerly known as Changi Women’s Prison), where she is currently serving a long term jail sentence for drug offences.  Through the institution’s psychology-based programme, Nora learned how to identify her weaknesses and use techniques to cope. “I can use the skills I learned to stop my mind from having negative thoughts, and to replace it with positive thoughts,” Nora said.  “Whenever I’m nervous about the questions during examinations, I will relax myself, breathe in and out, count to 10 and calm myself down. I ended up doing really great in the exams.” Nora achieved an overall credit of 13 points in the N-Level examinations, making her among the top in her cohort. She also received a merit award. Such positive outcomes are what officers hope to see among inmates at Institution A4, following enhancements to its rehabilitation programmes. As Singapore’s only women’s prison, the institution had in the last few years started to include more evidence-based psychological and counselling programmes for inmates. “Our programmes have always been cognitive behaviour-based; a lot of the thinking, the skills that you need,” said Charlotte Stephen, who is Senior Assistant Director overseeing the Correctional Rehabilitation Services Branch for women. In the women’s prison, there are more emotional needs to be met compared to the men’s, said Ms Stephen, who has been working at the Singapore Prison Service for 18 years. “There’s more in terms of how they regulate themselves, and how do they support each other. Those are the nuances and difference in the programmes (for male and female inmates). There’s a lot of affirmation for each other, a lot of group support, a lot of helping each other out, which I think comes a lot more naturally for women,” she explained. To help female inmates cope in their roles as mothers and daughters when they return home, family programmes, which are sessions geared towards enhancing mother, child and family bonds, are also available at Institution A4. Speaking during her visit to Institution A4, President Halimah Yacob urged the community to give their support to former inmates in society. “A lot of them say they reoffend because it’s difficult, there’s difficulties that they face. And these cover a whole broad spectrum - lacking skills, not getting employment, they don’t have support at home,” she said. According to Madam Halimah, about 20-22 per cent of female inmates reoffend within a period of two years. “Prison Service is doing its part through its rehabilitation programmes, but support from the community is also important,” she said. Madam Halimah also had a message for young girls: Stay away from drugs and gangsterism. The teenage years for girls can be difficult and volatile, but turning to substance and triads is “poisonous”, she said. During her visit, President Halimah was taken on a tour of Institution A4, where she interacted with female inmates. She was accompanied by Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/at-changi-prison-s-institution-a4-women-get-help-to-deal-with-10562152"}, {"datetime": "25 Jul 2018 08:28PM", "tags": ["Little India", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Four men on the run after slashing incident at Serangoon Road", "content": " SINGAPORE: The police are on the hunt for four men who allegedly attacked a 27-year-old man in Little India on Wednesday afternoon (Jul 25).  The police said they were alerted to the case at 202 Serangoon Road at about 2.20pm, adding that the victim was taken conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  The victim suffered multiple slashes, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force.  It is understood that the four suspects used a kitchen knife and a samurai sword in the attack before fleeing in a car.

Mr Ng, who was speaking on data governance in his keynote speech at cybersecurity trade show RSA Conference, pointed out that this aspect of safeguarding information tends to be viewed by decision-makers as a hindrance to doing business and only addressed later on. However, this should not be the case, given that “data is the lifeblood” of today’s digital economy and more care should be focused on this. The CSA executive also cited Uber’s data breach as another example of how these would eventually erode people’s trust in embracing digital services. The US-based ride-hailing company revealed last November that the personal data of about 57 million riders and drivers were compromised following a hack in 2016. Compounding the issue was the fact the company did not disclose the incident to those affected, but paid the hackers US$100,000 to destroy the data. Of the 57 million, 380,000 were Singapore users and the Personal Data Protection Commission said then it was investigating whether the company had breached the Personal Data Protection Act.  “The push for convenience should not be at the expense of security,” Mr Ng said. He also briefly reiterated the Government's message regarding Singapore’s most serious breach of personal data, when hackers burrowed into the patient database of healthcare provider SingHealth and made away with 1.5 million people’s data, including that of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The CSA deputy chief executive demurred on giving “juicy insider stories” about the hack, but stated, again, that such incidents while serious, should not derail the nation’s Smart Nation ambitions. This was the message put out by both Mr Lee and Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran when the cyberattack was first announced last Friday. Thus, Mr Ng said the onus is on governments and organisations to work together to foster trust on the Internet. He pointed out that many organisations today have corporate social responsibility programmes that allow them to give back to the wider society, and some of them even have key performance indicators baked into how they conduct such initiatives. Similarly, organisations should consider doing so for something Mr Ng coined as “corporate cybersecurity responsibility”.

The LTA announced on Wednesday (Jul 25) that the trains, made by Canadian transportation company Bombardier, are set to arrive in batches from 2021.  The first-generation NSEWL trains will be retired when the new trains enter service. The \"pioneer\" set of 66 trains have been serving commuters since the NSEWL - operated by SMRT - started in 1987.  Speaking at the contract-signing ceremony, Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan remarked that \"30 years of wear and tear is significant\".  \"There is a limit to how much upgrading and refurbishment we can do to keep these trains running smoothly,\" he said. \"Hence, after decades of service, it will soon be time to retire them.” The LTA is considering preserving one or two of these \"pioneer\" trains for display to the public. In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, LTA said it would call a tender for a contractor to scrap the first-generation trains.  It is exploring the option of donating or selling a few of the trains for a good cause, and are in the process of engaging relevant agencies to discuss the viability of this option. LTA said the conceptual design of the trains will be done in Germany, while the design coordination will be led by Bombardier’s team based in Singapore.  They will be manufactured and assembled in Bombardier’s facility in Changchun, China. Once delivered to Singapore, the trains will undergo testing and commissioning before being put to service.  Mr Khaw said Bombardier was chosen as it is a familiar partner, having supplied all 92 trains for the Downtown line.  “There are many shared systems between the Downtown Line, and the 66 new trains on the North-South and East-West lines. This means that there will be synergies in technical expertise across all three lines in future.” \"PREDICTIVE\" MAINTENANCE As part of the contract for the new trains, Bombardier also has the option to provide long-term technical and logistics support to SMRT for 30 years.  If SMRT takes up this option, then the cost of the whole package is S$1.2 billion. Excluding the maintenance, the cost of the 66 new trains is approximately $827 million. Deputy Chief Executive for Infrastructure and Development at LTA Chua Chong Kheng said: “A successful and durable rail system relies much on an efficient and assured long-term logistics and technical support network, which we are confident Bombardier will be able to provide based on their track record and close working relationship with LTA and our rail operators.  \"The award of the contract to Bombardier will revitalise our oldest rail lines and improve rail reliability, as well as Singapore’s rail capabilities.”  The new-generation trains boast a better design and new \"predictive maintenance\" features to improve reliability on the NSEWL.  The trains will have a suite of \"condition monitoring\" sensors and back-end analytic systems so that engineers can diagnose and rectify anomalies early, thus reducing the likelihood of the anomalies becoming train faults and affecting commuters. Four of the trains will also be fitted with an Automatic Track Inspection (ATI) system of cameras, lasers and sensors, to also help detect rail defects and avoid train disruptions. \"CATER TO ALL  COMMUTERS\" “The new trains will be designed to cater to all commuters, including those with different needs,” said Mr Khaw. “Without reducing the number of seats in the trains, our engineers have catered for wider spaces near the doors to allow passengers to enter and exit the trains more easily.  “Parents with strollers, wheelchair users, and commuters with personal mobility devices or foldable bicycles will all be able to benefit from the new design.” Mr Khaw also called for strong support from the public as the major assets on the North-South and East-West lines undergo renewal. He said: “strong public support is critical to the success of our renewal works”.  “I am grateful for commuters’ patience over the past year and a half of Early Closures and Late Openings, or ECLO for short. The extra hours granted by ECLO have enabled us to accelerate the re-signalling of the East-West Line,” he said. “We are halfway through the asset renewal programme for the North-South and East-West lines. Later this year, we will commence the critical task of renewing the power supply. Work on replacing the track circuits will also begin later this year. All these works will again require more periods of ECLO.” Sleeper replacement, which started in August 2013, was completed in December 2016. Meanwhile, replacement of the power-supplying third rail was completed in August last year. Rail operator SMRT has also completed the switch over to the new signalling system on the North-South Line, and the new signalling system has also been used on the East-West Line for daily passenger service since May 28. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-fleet-to-replace-66-oldest-mrt-trains-from-2021-10561652"}, {"datetime": "25 Jul 2018 03:48PM", "tags": ["International Champions Cup", "Paris Saint-Germain", "football"], "author": "", "title": "Football: PSG, Atletico squads arrive in Singapore for International Champions Cup", "content": " SINGAPORE: French league champions Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Spain's Atletico Madrid arrived in Singapore on Wednesday (Jul 25) ahead of the 2018 International Champions Cup (ICC), which kicks off at the National Stadium on Thursday.

Jason Sim Chon Ang, the 52-year-old director of Jason Parquet Specialist (Singapore), faces 16 cheating charges and two charges for offences under the Companies Act. Between 2011 and 2015, Sim allegedly cheated several banks: DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Malayan Banking Berhad, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, United Overseas Bank and RHB Bank Berhad. The banks were allegedly deceived into delivering large sums of money ranging from S$38,000 to S$538,000 to companies Sim was working with for the purported delivery of goods such as timber and flooring. The goods were not delivered, but Sim's accomplices got their employees to submit invoices and delivery orders to Jason Parquet Specialist. The company then used the invoices and delivery orders to deceive the banks into believing that goods were sold and delivered to Jason Parquet Specialist by the timber suppliers. Four timber suppliers that Sim worked with were charged with abetting Sim in cheating. Tan Ang Piaw, the 63-year-old Malaysian director of Sit Ley Timber, faces nine charges of abetting Sim in cheating and is out on bail of S$50,000. Another alleged accomplice, 57-year-old Singaporean Tjioe Chi Minh, the director of Tati Trading, was given five charges of abetting Sim in cheating. A third timber company director, 50-year-old Chua Mang Sin, was given one charge of abetting Sim in cheating. The fourth man - a procurement officer at Primex Lumber, 55-year-old Daniel Chew Bong Tiong, was also given one charge of abetting the cheating.  For cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property, the men can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. In August 2016, Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department said it was investigating Sim and Jason Parquet Specialist for a possible offence under the penal code.

During the Data Protection Trustmark (DPTM) certification scheme pilot, the organisations - which include, Singtel, DBS Bank, Fullerton Healthcare group and Redmart - will have their data protection practices independently assessed. If they meet the mark, they can use and display the Trustmark logo. These pilot organisations will help fine-tune the certification controls and processes, and the pilot itself will help finalise the DPTM scheme framework and certification process before it is launched at the end of this year. The DPTM scheme, first announced last July, will help companies gain consumers’ trust and confidence, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) said in a joint statement on Wednesday (Jul 25). “The greater the consumer trust, the more confidence consumers and the general public have in sharing their personal data with organisations, and the more data innovations organisations can deploy,” Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran said at the pilot launch on Wednesday. A survey conducted in 2016 showed that four out of five respondents agreed that the introduction of a certification scheme would improve consumer confidence, particularly if the certification is linked to a Government body. “In other words, good data protection policies and practices are a competitive advantage in the business world,” Mr Iswaran added. The DPTM also incorporates relevant international data protection principles such as the APEC Privacy Framework, which would allow organisations with the Trustmark to more seamlessly attain these international certifications. This gives them another mechanism to legitimately transfer data across borders to other certified organisations in participating Asia-Pacific economies. DBS senior vice president of financial crime and security services Eric Chung said the DPTM scheme \"reinforces our commitment to our customers that your money and personal data is safe with us, so we hope that it can give us a competitive advantage\". DBS is also \"quite confident\" it can obtain the Trustmark, Mr Chung said, pointing to the already highly-regulated nature of the finance industry. Nevertheless, he added that the bank will look at how it can protect customers' data better in relatively new areas like machine and artificial intelligence. While DBS has traditionally informed customers about data accountability through privacy policies, personal notifications and daily interactions, Mr Chung noted that the scheme will make this accountability more visible. \"Ultimately having a seal is not enough,\" he said. \"It's really our day-to-day operations, how we show in our practices and our interaction with customers that we do value their personal data and use it responsibly.\" IMDA has appointed three independent assessment bodies for the scheme: ISOCert, Setsco Services and TUV SUD PSB. This comes after PDPC in March invited accredited companies providing audit and certification of management systems to participate as assessment bodies. These bodies will assess if applicants’ data protection practices are aligned with DPTM certification requirements and identify gaps that need to be addressed. HOW TO APPLY The DPTM scheme is only available to organisations based in Singapore. Those interested must first apply to IMDA. They then select one of the three assessment bodies who will conduct an audit and submit its report to the regulator. If satisfied, IMDA will issue the certification. Certified organisations will be able to use and display a DPTM logo in their business communications for the duration of the certification, which is three years. “The DP Trustmark is a visible badge of recognition for accountable and responsible data protection practices used by organisations, including appropriate data protection policies and practices, adequate measures to identify and address data protection risks, and a sound data management plan,” Mr Iswaran said.

Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee announced this at the official opening of a large childcare centre, the Skool4Kidz Campus@Sengkang Riverside Park on Wednesday (Jul 25).  Four of the new centres, with about 2,000 places in total, will be located in Sengkang. The remaining centre, with about 600 places, will be in Punggol.  Sengkang and Punggol are newer estates with more young families. Mr Lee said even as authorities continue to build more preschools, they have to make sure that the schools have better learning experiences for every child. “We are closely working with operators to design preschools and design programmes that create more opportunities for our children to interact with the community, play and learn outdoors. For example, our centres will be designed to enable children to access the outdoors easily and safely,” said Mr Lee. At the Skool4Kidz Campus@Sengkang Riverside Park, children are brought outdoors daily as part of their curriculum. For instance, in their school’s garden, children learn about Singapore’s biodiversity and grow plants to harvest for food. Mr Lee said authorities will see how they can bring such outdoor learning experiences to other childcare centres, including smaller centres that are located at HDB premises.

In Singapore, small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have become synonymous with family-run hawker stalls, provision shops and cafes - businesses that we’ve celebrated as a source of optimism and part of the social fabric of the country. However, what defines a successful small business today, particularly one that is an engine of sustainable job growth, is something entirely different from romaticised images of the past. THE RISE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS Most of our beliefs about SMEs stems from MIT researcher David Birch’s book The Job Generation Process. Decades ago, the seminal study disproved the once-unassailable notion that large firms were at the heart of the American economy. From 1969 to 1976, Birch wrote, companies with 100 or fewer employees had created more than 80 per cent of all new employment. This was shocking information at a time when large corporations were king. The study reverberated across Asia, including Singapore. Industry champions and policymakers woke up to the fact that small businesses compose well over 90 per cent of the economy and were responsible for a huge number of jobs created each year. But this monolithic view of small business persists today. As technology transforms our economy, why do we still put corner cafes and the software start-ups in the same category? That’s how many mainstream experts still count SMEs in this era of smartphones, cloud computing, and online marketplaces. Business looks very different in 2018 than it did when Birch wrote his pioneering paper. For one, we’re doing a lot more of it online, in real-time and on smaller screens. As someone at a company that works with millions of businesses around the world, including many high-growth start-ups, I see two emerging business models that are proving to be engines of explosive growth and have the potential to be game changers. MARKETPLACES AND ENABLERS  Marketplaces connect individuals - usually buyers and sellers - to each other. Enablers are companies that provide the technology and infrastructure that enable small businesses to scale up their business, or in the case of traditional offline businesses, take their business online. These two models are creating new jobs using technology, and are enabling traditional businesses to tap into the Internet economy and reach new markets. Much has been written about ride-sharing companies like Grab, e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon and online travel businesses like Airbnb, that match demand with supply. But outside of these large tech platforms, a host of smaller marketplaces are cropping up in local markets and niche industries. These businesses get-to-market quickly and help their sellers and service providers, many of whom are often traditional organisations and SMEs, solve old problems. Examples include Chope, a restaurant booking service that also shares special deals and offers with users; Giving.sg, a platform that enables donations to charities from interested donors; and Homage, a marketplace that helps Singaporeans find, hire and pay caregivers for the elderly. Then, we have the enablers. These upstarts provide technology infrastructure and tools so that traditional SMEs can get going quicker and compete with much larger, entrenched market players. TradeGecko, for example, provides software that helps e-commerce and wholesale businesses manage their inventory. HReasily offers companies a suite of HR tools from payroll to claim applications and leave management, and Xero makes accounting easier for businesses around the world with their cloud-based accounting software. HOOK ONTO A GAZELLE In reality, all businesses start small but not all small businesses are the same. Going back to Professor Birch shows us why we should bet on these high-growth SMEs. In 1994, realising that he had lumped SMEs of all ages and maturities together, he revised his thesis. In isolating the job-creating companies that we know today as start-ups, Birch called them “gazelles” — not because of their small size, but because of their expansionary quality; their sales doubled every four years. By his estimates, these firms, roughly 4 per cent of all US companies, were responsible for 70 per cent of all jobs. Likewise in Singapore, start-ups defined to be up to 5 years old provided 24,300 jobs last year. We need to reframe the conversation about SMEs and make sure we’re deploying the right sorts of support and incentives in our economy to help these gazelles grow, thrive and create jobs. Already, Singapore has been the home base for unicorns like Garena (now known as Sea), Razer, Lazada and Grab, and the start-up ecosystem was ranked 12th in the world overall and first for talent in the Genome Start-up Ecosystem Report. Through long-term government programmes such as Block 71 and SMEs Go Digital, Singapore is already ahead of the curve when it comes to creating an environment in which gazelles can thrive. Redefining what small business means could redefine how new jobs are created and sustained for years to come. I think that’s reason for optimism.

For the seven years she's lived in the estate, the resident - a lady in her 40s - has not been able to enjoy the evening breeze from the comfort of her home. The reason? Dinner crowds at the famous zi char eatery less than 50 metres from her home. “I can’t stand the noise. I get home from work to get some rest, and every day people come and go from that shop until (it's) late,” said the resident, who declined to reveal her name. “Now that they’re officially (a commercial unit), it just legitimises the noise they are making,” she added. The zi char place she was referring to - Por Kee Eating House - will soon have its commercial status in Tiong Bahru secured, after the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) announced on Tuesday the rezoning of land use for 28 sites in the estate. The 28 ground-floor units, including Ting Heng Seafood Restaurant and Nimble Knead Massage, were previously classified as “Residential”. After the rezoning, they will be classified as \"Residential with Commercial at First Storey\"  URA said the move reinforces its commitment to support the vibrant landscape in Tiong Bahru, and was made after a two-year study and feedback from the community. However, some residents in the area are worried that officially recognising the commercial status of these shops - which have been operating their businesses based on approvals given by agencies over the past decades - will only increase the already large crowds in the estate, particularly after office hours and on the weekends.   Another resident in the area who declined to be named, told Channel NewsAsia that she communicated her concerns to URA during a focus group session earlier this year, but that there were no follow-ups from the authority. “I told them that there were some businesses that will actually help residents, but other business will not. I don’t want to be specific but there are some places that aren’t good here,” said the resident, who owns an apparel shop on Yong Siak Street, also in Tiong Bahru. Meanwhile, a resident at Eng Wat Street, who requested to be known only as Mr Teo, told Channel NewsAsia that some of the businesses that will be granted commercial status tend to draw large crowds on the weekends. He added that some of their customers park at lots reserved for residents. “I don’t want to name names, but there’s a massage place and a famous café nearby. They’re crowded on weekends, and I’m fine with that, but these people cannot be parking in the reserved lots,” said Mr Teo.   “The residents lots are in red while the visitor lots are in white … Sometimes I’m forced to wait up to 20 minutes just to park near my home,” he added. However, Ms Adeline, who works at pop-up shoe shop Another Sole on Eng Hoon Street, told Channel NewsAsia that commercialising spaces in the area is a positive move for residents as they can benefit from the stores located \"a stones’ throw\" from their homes. “There are so many good cafes in the area, places to eat. The kind of businesses here are not the ones that encourage smoking and littering,” she said. According to Ms Adeline, Another Sole has not been classified as a commercial unit by URA because customers are not able to purchase the physical goods from the shop; the pop-up store allows visitors to browse and subsequently purchase their desired items online. “We don’t sell anything, and we don’t really inconvenient any residents, although we’re operating just below a few houses. We want to continue our work here,” she said.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tiong-bahru-rezoning-formalising-commercial-status-of-shops-10559028"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 11:24PM", "tags": ["Modern Services Training Committee", "NTUC"], "author": "Eugenia Lim", "title": "More help for modern services workers to reskill", "content": " SINGAPORE: Workers in the financial and professional services as well as infocomm and media sectors will get more help to adapt to a changing work environment.

The UN Security Council's unanimous adoption of tougher sanctions three times last year that put pressure on Pyongyang to enter talks on scrapping its nuclear weapons programme is the example Haley gave Trump in a phone call in June. In an interview with Reuters, Haley recalled telling Trump: \"We would not be in the situation we are with North Korea without the UN because that was the only way to get the international community on the same page.\" The United States and other countries believe the sanctions helped to bring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un around to meeting with Trump at an historic summit in Singapore in June. Haley said Trump asked her what she thought of the United Nations, then 17 months into her post and after the United States became the first country to quit the UN Human Rights Council. She said she rattled off a litany of complaints. \"Unbelievably bureaucratic, it wastes a lot of money, it has some real biases against Israel, against us at times, it ignores a lot that's going on that needs attention.\" Haley's relay of their phone call illustrates how she guides the president who shuns the international forums and pacts the United States has helped build over decades. When Trump took office, he called the UN \"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.\" Some diplomats have said they see the former South Carolina governor as the stable face of US foreign policy. When Trump leaves them confused, some say they look to her for interpretation. \"My job is to give clarity to everything the administration's doing so that no one wonders where we are. I always wanted to make sure there was no gray. That it was black and white,\" Haley said in the interview during a trip last month to India, the country from which her parents emigrated to the United States. Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, described Haley's job as selling the \"administration's anti-UN positions to the public.\" \"That annoys other diplomats,\" Gowan added. RUSSIA TENSIONS Haley has long taken a tougher public stance on Russia than her boss. In May she described Russian expansionism in Ukraine as \"outrageous\" and said the US position \"will not waver.\" Days later, however, Trump urged the Group of Seven countries to reinstate Russia, booted out for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Two weeks before Trump's Jul 16 summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Haley told Reuters that \"basically what the president is saying is it's better for us to have communication than not.\" But then the summit turned into a nightmare for the White House when Trump, at the joint news conference, sided with Putin's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 US election rather than the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies. A political outcry in Washington drowned out Trump's message that the two nuclear powers should improve their relations, which are at a post-Cold War low. Haley has not responded to Reuters' requests for comment on the summit. Differences over Russia also caused rare public friction for Haley within the administration when she announced in April that Washington was going to sanction Moscow over its support of Syria's government. Trump then decided not to go ahead. \"The president has every right to change his mind, every right,\" Haley said. Trump never raised the incident with her, she said. Her UN counterparts describe her as charming and yet very tough. She sees herself as a fighter. \"I don't see (my role) as pushing an 'America First' policy, I see it as defending America because every day I feel like I put body armour on. I just don't know who I'm fighting that day,\" Haley said. Haley carved out a high-profile role within the Trump administration from the moment she was offered the job, telling the president she would only accept it if she was made a member of the Cabinet and the National Security Council. \"She's got an eye and ear for where the politics of an issue are,\" said a senior Western diplomat, who, like all those consulted at the United Nations, would only speak on condition of anonymity. Those kinds of instincts have helped put the 46-year-old mother of two on the list of possible Republican presidential candidates. She dismisses the presidential chatter and said it has never come up with Trump, who intends to run again in 2020, \"because he knows he doesn't need to raise it.\" (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Mary Milliken and Grant McCool)", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/every-day-i-feel-like-i-put-body-armour-on-trump-s-un-envoy-10558888"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 07:31PM", "tags": ["National Day", "MCI", "National Geographic"], "author": "", "title": "National Geographic to release limited Singapore edition of magazine", "content": " SINGAPORE: National Geographic will be releasing a Singapore edition of the magazine - complete with an exclusive interview with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong - to commemorate Singapore's 53rd National Day.

Cai Mei Ying, 49, works at a market stall at Block 85, Bedok North Street 4, selling beancurd and noodles. On Sep 22, 2016, at about 9.50am, Cai left her Bedok home on her bicycle, headed for her stall at the market. She had a box with food ingredients on top of a rack at the back of the bicycle, and a lunchbox in the basket in front. She cycled into the market compound and approached a cross junction inside. The victim, Madam Ang Ah Soi, was walking nearby.  Another stall owner at the market saw that they were about to collide and shouted loudly in Hokkien: \"There are people, there are people!\" Cai applied the brake and placed her foot on the ground, but could not stop her bicycle. The front wheel of her bicycle hit Mdm Ang's right leg, and she fell backwards on the ground. The incident occurred right in front of a \"No Bicycles\" sign, court documents said. Mdm Ang could not stand and was taken to hospital where she was admitted for surgery. She fractured her hip and had to attend numerous medical appointments, incurring bills of more than S$13,000. She does not have medical insurance. Cai pleaded guilty this year to one charge of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act. The prosecution asked for a sentence of at least four weeks' jail, saying that Cai had wasted time and resources by retracting her original plea of guilt, which she had made last year. Cai's lawyer said that Cai was not cycling for recreation but was on her rounds delivering beansprouts to another stall in the market. \"She was making a living for herself. She supports her household,\" he said. District Judge Jill Tan agreed with the prosecution that a measure of deterrence had to be included in the sentence. She sentenced Cai to two weeks' jail and ordered her to pay Madam Ang S$7,000 as compensation. \"The accused has raised about S$5,000 despite her financial circumstances,\" said the judge.

If those steps had been taken, the \"cyber kill-chain\" for the hacker would have been disrupted and the surface area exposed to the attack would have been reduced, Mr Teo added. Mr Teo made the remarks in a speech to engineers and leaders from public agencies -including the Land Transport Authority and the Ministry of Defence - as well as representatives from several polytechnics, at thePublic Service Engineering Conference held at the Resorts World Sentosa Convention Centre on Tuesday (Jul 24). Mr Teo also revealed how the cyberattackers entered the SingHealth Group’s database servers. He disclosed that front-end devices at SingHealth were capable of thwarting “ordinary, run-of-the-mill” attacks. They had existing antivirus and anti-intrusion software that could keep out “many of such attempts”. However, the Internet-linked workstations used by thousands of users from the medical and academic community provided a large “attack surface” for the “sophisticated and persistent intruder”, he said.  Mr Teo revealed that the intruders managed to circumvent security barriers in the \"intermediate layer that manages and screens user requests from the outer user layer to access IT database servers\". As a result, the attacker was able to gain access into a segment of the database and obtain and exfiltrate the data to overseas servers, Mr Teo said. Despite the sophistication of the attackers, the system had in place certain measures that limited the extent of the damage, Mr Teo said. He noted that IT system operators were able to self-discover and report the intrusion. Government cybersecurity specialists were also able to investigate and identify the mode of intrusion to scope and contain the damage, and “check backs” with an overseas network of trusted partner agencies were conducted. The Government is nevertheless studying if the intrusion could have been detected more quickly and prevented such a large data loss, Mr Teo said. He also added that the SingHealth incident underscores the importance of reporting IT incidents to the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) and to comprehensive systems logs in the IT system. Those steps allowed investigations and diagnoses to contain the intrusion, identify the mode of intrusion, the attack vector and cope out the extent of damage, he said.  Technical solutions aside, DPM Teo said that addressing public concerns and confidence to the public and users are also crucial in such incidents. This must be done “as transparently as possible”. He said that the formation of the Committee of Inquiry demonstrated that the Government was taking the matter seriously.   The speech, which covered wide-ranging topics on \"Whole of Nation\" engineering and innovation solutions, also saw Mr Teo urge public service engineers to design systems and operate them to “keep out an attack” and detect intrusions in the digital age.  This is especially important as Singapore has seen an almost 10-fold increase in phishing attacks since 2016, and with a recent global surge of security incidents targeting government systems and networks. He stressed that the SingHealth cyberattack should not hold back the country's Smart Nation and Digital Government ambitions.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/internet-separation-should-have-been-implemented-teo-chee-hean-10558584"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 06:35PM", "tags": ["court", "police", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Drunk woman who bit police officer sentenced to five months' jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: A drunk woman who bit a police officer's hand was sentenced to five months' jail on Tuesday (Jul 24). Zhang Youjiao, a 31-year-old Chinese national, was in Singapore on a social visit pass in December last year. At 3.51am on Dec 9, a caller told the police over the phone that a woman was walking in the middle of Serangoon Road. Two police officers went to the scene and saw Zhang sitting at the side of the road, smelling of alcohol. Sergeant Lim Mei Jing, 21, spoke to Zhang in Mandarin and told her it was dangerous to sit there. She asked Zhang to move to the pavement, but Zhang refused. Zhang later challenged Sgt Lim to lock her up for 24 hours and began to raise her voice and behave aggressively, court documents said. Sgt Lim and her partner decided to place Zhang under arrest, but Zhang put up a violent struggle, biting Sgt Lim's right hand in the process. She later admitted that she had consumed five to six cups of beer before the incident. On Tuesday, the defence said that a video of the incident showed an officer asking Sgt Lim if the bite was serious. \"She said no,\" the defence said, asking for two to three months' jail. The defence said that even if there was a bite, it was not a weapon. In response, the prosecutor said that teeth were used and biting can be considered a weapon.

These include delinking Internet access on workstations, similar to measures taken by the public healthcare clusters.  At Mount Alvernia Hospital, cyber monitoring has been stepped up and Internet isolation started, said its chief executive Dr Lam Kian Ming on Tuesday (Jul 24).  The IT security team is on high alert to monitor and be ready to respond quickly in the event of any potential breach, he added. The hospital also issued an internal memo to all staff to reinforce IT data protection education and awareness, after the SingHealth incident came to light.  “Our staff has restricted Internet access currently. Moving forward we will be segregating Internet access and there will be no Internet access for terminals with access to patients’ data,” he added.  The \"most serious breach of personal data” in Singapore’s history took place last month, with 1.5 million SingHealth patients’ records accessed and copied while 160,000 of those had their outpatient dispensed medicines’ records taken, the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Communications and Information said on Friday. Parkway Pantai, which has under its umbrella four private hospitals -Mount Elizabeth, Mouth Elizabeth Novena, Gleneagles and Parkway East- has taken similar steps. “In the light of the recent events, we have suspended Internet access from our internal network and will be putting in place separate devices that will be physically segregated from our company networks for those who need Internet access for work,” said chief executive of Parkway Pantai’s Singapore Operations Division Phua Tien Beng. ACCESS TO WEBSITES, EXTERNAL STORAGE DEVICES RESTRICTED Internet access on computers for medical staff at Thomson Medical Centre is restricted to a \"need to use\" basis, said its chief executive Mrs Mega Shuen. “Reviews are conducted before access to websites is granted. We have also invested in new software to monitor irregularities and malicious activity in the network,” she said.  Dr Lam added that the hospital does regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessment on its systems and patches its systems monthly.  “There are no 100 per cent safe IT systems and there is no easy fix to cyber threat, “ he said, adding that being more prepared is key.  \"These are our patients’ medical data and it is our responsibility to step up protection to maintain data confidentiality and integrity, and to prevent illegal access,\" he said. Mr Phua echoed similar views. Patient data at Parkway Pantai is guarded by network segregation, multi-layer firewalls and continuous security monitoring, he said, adding that as part of ongoing cybersecurity efforts, access to all external storage devices has been removed. Internet access has been restricted to work-related websites “since some time ago”, he added.  The hospitals said apart from the security measures, it is also important to raise awareness among staff, and educating them on best practices. “In the light of this attack, a primary task for us now is to continue to educate and reinforce to our patients and doctors the risks that comes with being digital and gaining efficiency,” Dr Lam said.  Farrer Park Hospital, which said it is on heightened alert due to the incident, said that not all staff have access to the Internet and those who do, have restricted access. Other than traditional info-security defences like firewalls and anti-virus software, the hospital also has in place two Artificial Intelligence systems that protect the hospital's laptops, computers and network, the hospital's Chief Information Officer James Woo said.

This may include, for instance, One-Time Password, PIN, biometrics, last transaction date or amount, etc.” MAS added it has also directed all financial institutions to conduct a \"risk assessment of the impact of the SingHealth incident on their existing control measures for financial services offered to customers, including transaction and inquiry functions\". \"MAS will work closely with the financial institutions to ensure that robust cyber defences are in place so that customers can carry out online financial transactions with confidence,\" said MAS’ chief cybersecurity officer Tan Yeow Seng.

He was sentenced to 18 months' jail in May last year for criminal intimidation, unlawful stalking and intentionally causing alarm to the sisters and their family members. In March this year, he was released from prison under a conditional remission order and sent to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), where he was treated. Tan was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in 2010 when he was 15. His parents died within a month of each other in 2015, and he has since lived with his grandparents. On Jun 17 this year, Tan was on home leave from IMH. In the morning, he went to church, which he has been attending since 2015. Later that night, he left his home at around 10pm with writing tools. He wrote on a note: \"I love your daughter.\" He went on to describe explicit sexual acts he wished to perform on the 16-year-old. He used a piece of Blu-tack to stick the paper on the door of the flat next to the girl's home in Pasir Ris. The girl's mother made a police report that night. On Tuesday, Tan pleaded guilty to intentionally causing alarm to the girl's mother by making insulting communication towards her.

It's part of harassment, okay. I don't want people to control me that way.\" He asked the judge not to put him in jail, and instead said he could pay a fine. \"I promise that I will never do it again if the police, the halfway house people and the doctor stop harassing me,\" he said.

In addition to Por Kee Eating House and Nimble Knead Massage, the units also include Flock Cafe, Singapore Realtors, Cozy Wine, One Olive and Drips Bakery Cafe.  The rezoning exercise will take place over the next month and follows a study conducted over two years on the uses in the estate, which also took into account feedback from residents. “The community shared that they were supportive of the estate’s vibrant character, and having a good mix of business to serve residential and visitors,” said the URA in a news release.  “At the same time, they emphasised the need to maintain residential amenity, so that residents can continue to have a good living environment.” The Tiong Bahru neighbourhood was developed in the 1930s as Singapore’s first housing estate. In recent times, rapid gentrification in the neighbourhood has seen a increased demand for commercial space in the estate. According to the URA, common complaints from residents included noise created by businesses, indiscriminate littering and safety concerns. The URA also said that there are about 15 ground floor businesses in the estate that have been operating without approval at premises meant only for residential use. The URA has posted letters to these business operators, with officers also going on the ground to speak to some of them to address these infringements. They intend to reach out to the remaining operators in due time.

Mr Iswaran also committed to a longer-term plan to invest in digital technologies R&D. The minister, who took over the ministry from Mr Yaacob Ibrahim, shared that S$360 million was allocated to the Services and Digital Economy domain under the RIE2020 plan and “promising investments” in initiatives like AI Singapore and cybersecurity have been made. But more needs to be done. “I fully intend to increase R&D spending on the Services and Digital Economy domain,” the minister said. “We must be prepared to do more in R&D because digital technologies will only become more pervasive - and companies and countries around us are already investing heavily in this.” He said MCI is reviewing its plans in this area with the National Research Foundation (NRF) and the outcome will be announced later this year. In the meantime, Mr Iswaran said training the local workforce in digital skills through the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme is ongoing. A total of 39,000 training places have been taken or committed by companies since its launch in 2016. This, he said, can give more Singaporeans the opportunity to participate in the digital economy with good ICT jobs. These initiatives are part of MCI’s efforts to deepen Singapore’s capabilities to keep pace and retain its competitive edge in today’s digital age, he explained. ONE-STOP SHOP Mr Iswaran also highlighted another initiative meant to better address the needs of local ICM companies. Reiterating the ministry’s aim to build a “vibrant, world-class ICM industry that drives the economy and powers a Smart Nation”, the minister said implementation is key and MCI needs to engage, understand the needs of enterprises and marshal national resources to help them realise their plans. Currently, there are several agencies involved in this, namely Enterprise Singapore, Economic Development Board (EDB) and Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), but he said more can be done to bring their efforts together. To better support these ICM companies, these agencies will form a joint office, Mr Iswaran announced. This digital industry office will bring together their programmes in improving market access, developing enterprises, industry and talent as well as account management, the minister added. “In a way, this joint office will be our own Government start-up for how we’d do industry development,” Mr Iswaran said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-investment-dollars-refreshed-tech-roadmap-in-the-works-s-10558180"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 05:00PM", "tags": ["travel", "aviation", "Singapore Airlines"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore Airlines launches new digital wallet KrisPay", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines' (SIA) KrisFlyer members will be able to use their air miles to pay for petrol, food and other services using KrisPay, a new app launched on Tuesday (Jul 24).

Now you can get a closer look at an outfit created by one of the music superstar’s go-to fashion designers. At next month’s Singapore Night Festival (SNF), an exhibition of some unusual garments will include a Maori culture-inspired piece by designers Maria Tsopanaki and Dimitri Mavinis. The duo are behind the London-based fashion label Erevos Aether, which has done work for the likes of Lady Gaga, The Black Eyed Peas, Nicki Minaj and Jessie J. Called Princess Niwareka, the outfit made of “vegan leather” and mirrors will be among eight unusual pieces on display at an exhibit by the World Of Wearable Art, the popular design competition held every year in New Zealand.  Another work, by Singapore-based designer and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) professor Galina Mihaleva, will also be shown. These will be displayed at the National Design Centre throughout the festival, which runs from Aug 17 to 25. The fashion showcase is one of the highlights at the 11th edition of the festival, which also includes the annual Night Lights segment featuring 16 light installations around the Bras Basah.Bugis precinct. There will also be 27 performances throughout the area, as well as F&B and crafts options.  There have also been some changes this year – there will be no road closures for Armenian Street this year and instead, the action in that area will move into the alleyway between The Substation and Peranakan Museum. This edition will also have less of the huge spectacles normally associated with the event, and focus more on something more personal and intimate. Festival programme director Jervais Choo said: “The idea is for unexpected encounters at different corners of the festival grounds, which we have creatively curated for that element of surprise\". In the spirit of surprising sartorial choices, here are CNA Lifestyle’s picks of other programmes to look out for – from a more “what are they wearing?” point of view.  Don’t judge. SINGAPORE'S HARAJUKU FASHIONISTAS If you’re a fan of the monthly Harajuku Fashion Walk in Tokyo, keep an eye out for this Singapore event, where you can either dress up or take photos. It’ll be a certified kawaii moment. Aug 25, 7pm, at SAM at 8Q. More details at https://www.facebook.com/HarajukuFW.SG/ ROBOT SUITS FOR DANCERS Homegrown company Hope Technik has been making cool mecha-like exoskeletons, including the recent Auberon, the country’s first pneumatic-powered exoskeletons for firefighters. And for the festival, one of their other suits – the Audra – will be worn by local jazz dance troupe EV Dance for a unique collaboration. The Audra is used to help workers lift heavy loads, so we’re curious as to how agile and flexible dancers will be using these to bust some moves. At the very least, we’re sure they won’t be throwing out their backs. Aug 23 to 25, 8.30pm and 10pm, Queen Street and LTA Walkway. PEOPLE IN HORSE COSTUMES A group of French performers will be galloping into the festival, sort of. Compagnie des Quidams will be roving around in a show called FierS a Cheval – where they’ll be dressed up as horses and strangely dressed sci-fi Venetians. And no, you can’t ride them. Aug 23 to 25, various timings and spots from National Museum of Singapore to SMU Campus Green. WRESTLERS IN SPANDEX Wrestling shows have become quite a regular feature at the festival, and the experimental pro-wrestling group Grapple Max are back – but with a twist. This year, they’ll presenting The Arcade, a wrestling match done like a live-action arcade game. That means our dudes and gals in spandex will be dressed up as characters from the arcade scene of the 1990s. Can anyone say “Hadouken\"? Aug 24 and 25, 8pm and 10.10pm, at the SMU School of Infosystems. SCARY-LOOKING DRUMMERS IN BLACK There’s usually always one drumming group every year, and this time around, it’s Spain’s Deabru Beltzak and local group MOTUS, who’ll be performing Su A Feu. So what’s different with these guys? Well, for one, they look pretty intimidating – they’re all in black, wear Darth Vader-like masks and have some pyrotechnic effects spewing out from somewhere as they bang away on their drums. A bit like a Marvel movie villain who’s got his groove on. Aug 23 to 25, 7.51pm and 9.26pm, at Cathay Green.

Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity S Iswaran said on Jul 20 he would convene the COI to investigate the incident, and the body will be chaired by retired chief district judge Richard Magnus.  On Tuesday, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) in a press release gave more information on its makeup, saying he would be joined by three more members.  These include Mr Lee Fook Sun, chairman of Quann World, Mr T K Udairam, group chief operating officer of Sheares Healthcare Management and Ms Cham Hui Fong, assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). In a statement, Mr Magnus said: \"This is a responsibility that I take seriously. I will work with the COI members to ensure that we fully deliver on this important task which has been entrusted to us.” The COI was tasked to establish the events and contributing factors leading to the cyberattack on SingHealth’s patient database system on or around Jun 27 this year, and the subsequent stealing of data from the network.  It will also look at how Integrated Health Information Systems (IHIS) and SingHealth responded, and recommend measures to enhance the incident response plans for similar incidents and measures to better protect SingHealth’s IT system against similar attacks. With these findings, the committee is to also recommend measures to reduce the risk of such cyberattacks on public sector IT systems which contain large databases of personal data including in the other public healthcare clusters, MCI said in the press release. The COI will conduct private and public hearings, and is to submit a report on its findings and recommendations to Mr Iswaran by Dec 31, 2018, it added.  The minister, during his speech at the ministry’s annual workplan seminar on Tuesday, said the SingHealth cyberattack is an example of incidents that threaten to erode the “precious trust” in the institutions in Singapore, which has been painstakingly built up. “This incident was a deliberate and sophisticated attack that caused the most serious breach of personal data in Singapore’s history,” Mr Iswaran said. “But we were also fortunate because it could have been worse. We were fortunate that there was early detection in the exfiltration of data.” He added that while the Government will do everything it can to strengthen its systems, it cannot completely eliminate the risk of another cyberattack. “That is the nature of this ongoing battle. The would-be attackers are constantly developing new capabilities even as we reinforce our IT systems,” he said.  He also reiterated his earlier message, as well as that of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, that the incident, or any others like it, should not be allowed to derail Singapore’s Smart Nation plans. “Digital is the way of the future,” Mr Iswaran said. “We must adapt ourselves to operate effectively and securely in the digital world, to deliver better public services, enhance our economic competitiveness and create opportunities for our enterprises and our people.” DATA REGULATIONS TO BE UPDATED The minister also pointed out that one of the Government's responsibilities is to provide transparent, effective and progressive regulations, including those governing data. He said the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is currently being reviewed to strike the right balance between organisations' legitimate need to collect and use personal data and people's concern for greater accountability for the use of such data. In a response to Channel NewsAsia's queries on Tuesday, an MCI spokesperson said the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has been notified of the cyberattack and will investigate the matter. SingHealth and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHIS) are corporate entities which are bound by the PDPA, the spokesperson added. \"PDPC will take into account the Committee of Inquiry’s report in its determination/assessment of any appropriate action to be taken,\" the spokesperson said. Other initiatives to strengthen the local regulatory landscape include the development of Singapore's own certification system, said Mr Iswaran.

The first is an IT system to improve back-end processes.  Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee launched the iShine Cloud at the Social Service Summit on Tuesday (Jul 24).  Jointly developed by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and Singapore Pools, iShine Cloud provides a suite of integrated IT cloud services specific to the charity sector.  It includes office productivity tools, shared storage, human resources and accounting packages, which voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) can enjoy at subsidised rates. Those who need further funding can tap on NCSS’s VWO-Charities Capability Fund.  \"It will free up the time of our social service professionals to attend to our clients, instead of being bogged down by administrative tasks,\" said Mr Lee. \"Initiatives such as the iShine Cloud can also help our sector adopt IT and improve our work processes by aggregating common needs across VWOs.  \"This allows us to achieve economies of scale and optimise resources not only within our VWOs but across the sector.\" SOCIAL SERVICE NAVIGATOR The second initiative is the Social Service Navigator, an interactive online platform and mobile portal that consolidates information on social service providers, programmes and resources all over Singapore. It is a rich database to help social service professionals find the resources they need to support their daily work. The platform aims to significantly reduce the time social service professionals spend searching for suitable programmes to better address the needs of their clients in a more holistic manner, as well as to reduce service duplication and identify any service gaps. Another key topic discussed at the event was the issue of new funding models in the social services sector, with the view of long-term sustainability and issues such as donor fatigue. NCSS vice-president Anita Fam moderated a panel discussion which included Mr Lee and Nominated Member of Parliament Chia Yong Yong.  The discussion centred on a key challenge faced by social service organisations, which is how to find sustainable ways to fund their programmes and operations. This is set against the backdrop of more complex societal needs and a growing demand for social services. A variety of funding tools that would help diversify and grow funding streams were explored.  These went beyond traditional grants to less common funding instruments, such as social impact bonds and investing and endowment funds. The panel also emphasised the need for more collaboration among the 3Ps of People, Private and Public to facilitate more impactful giving. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/social-services-sector-aims-to-strengthen-service-delivery-with-10557646"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 11:56AM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Man who stole S$356 worth of sex toys given a week's jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 52-year-old man who stole S$356 worth of sex toys from a shop in Chinatown was sentenced to a week's jail on Tuesday (Jul 24). Tan Swee Peng visited the Casanova adult toy shop at 84 Pagoda Street on Jul 22 in 2017. He was in the store at about 8.30pm browsing the shelves. After checking that none of the shop staff were looking at him, Tan angled his body away from the payment counter and placed one item into a plastic bag he had brought with him, following up with two more items. He later admitted to choosing items which were not in the view of the shop staff. Tan left the store with the three items: A vibrating ring with nipple clamps worth S$149, a nipple vibrator worth S$89 and another sex toy worth S$118.  His acts were caught on closed-circuit television footage. Tan returned to the shop the next day and was recognised by a sales assistant, who had seen him in the CCTV footage.  She called the police, who arrested him and subsequently recovered the stolen items. Tan pleaded guilty to one charge of theft in dwelling, with another charge taken into consideration. The prosecution on Tuesday asked for a sentence of four weeks' jail, saying that Tan was convicted of theft just two years ago in 2016. However, Tan's lawyer Shaneet Rai said that Tan is divorced and lives with his older brother and elderly mother. He was unemployed at that time and has been seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health since 2014 for panic disorder, Mr Rai said. He was remanded for theft in 2016 and diagnosed with obsessive compulsive personality traits. On the day of the offence, Tan had suffered a panic attack as a result of his family nagging him about his unemployment, Mr Rai said. Thus, he went for a walk to calm himself down and passed by the sex shop. He entered out of curiosity and committed the offence. Asking for no more than two to three weeks' jail, Mr Rai said that Tan has found gainful employment as a part-time printing assistant at a school and continues to seek treatment for his mental illness. District Judge Eddy Tham said that such a panic attack would not cause Tan to act involuntarily. \"I trust that you will respond well to counselling,\" said the judge to Tan. \"I will impose a short custodial sentence of one week's imprisonment.

Plenty of work ahead for HPB to get hawkers on board", "content": " SINGAPORE: It's a late Friday morning and there is a lull in business at the Tiong Bahru Food Centre. The breakfast crowd is thinning, and the hordes of office workers that usually throng the hawker centre for lunch have yet to stream in. It is the best time for Health Promotion Board (HPB) officer Tan Meiying to make her approach. As she wends her way through the food centre, she waves at the hawkers. Some return the greeting with a friendly smile and wave. “Some of them are like my friends now,” she says. “They even know my child.” She is a familiar face to the hawkers, having walked the ground there in the past few months, speaking to them to encourage them to use wholegrain staples in their dishes. WHY DO THIS?  Ms Tan is part of a team sent out by the HPB in their ongoing efforts to make it easier for Singaporeans to choose healthier food options when they eat out. The Healthier Dining Programme, which was introduced in 2014, started off by getting restaurants and food courts to offer healthier options such as 500-calorie meals.  In July 2017, the programme was extended to hawker centres and coffee shops, where they worked with the stallholders to offer lower-calorie options, such as reduced sugar and oil in their dishes.  To encourage take-up by consumers, the HPB runs periodic promotions such as distributing discount vouchers. The programme is now being extended further, with the HPB working to encourage hawkers to offer healthier ingredients, such as wholegrains. To sweeten the deal for customers, promotions are lined up, such as a S$2 discount on wholegrain meals bought from participating hawkers. By April next year, HPB aims to have 4 in 10 hawker stalls in Singapore offering low-calorie or healthier options. HPB's deputy director of the obesity prevention management division Ann Low said that their end-goal can be summed up in two words: accessibility and availability.  “It’s not just the restaurants and food courts, but also the everyday eating places like the hawker centres and coffee shops,” she said. “So there is always a healthier option, whatever your budget is.” But it is by no means an easy task, Ms Low explained. “When we’re getting the hawkers to offer lower-calorie options, there’s actually a minimal change in terms of their offerings,” she said. “The hawkers get to keep their usual menu, but just use less oil or sugar.” “But when it comes to changing of ingredients like whole grains, it will affect their operations and suppliers.” “Some of them are really quite reluctant,” she said. And as Ms Tan goes around encouraging hawkers to participate in the promotion, she is well aware of this reluctance. She makes a beeline for a stall whose owner has so far refused to take part. Seeing her approach, the elderly lady grunts and waves her away. “I’m not taking part,” the hawker said in Mandarin. “Don’t bother talking to me about it.” DEMAND FROM CUSTOMERS IS CRUCIAL  But why are the hawkers so reluctant? A lack of customer demand appears to be the answer. “I ordered a bit of brown rice about three months ago just to try it out,” said nasi lemak seller Tan Wah Ann. “But the customers really didn’t want it, because they think brown rice doesn’t taste as nice.” “I cooked it already, and I couldn’t finish selling it, so I had to throw it away,” he added. “Even if you give it to me for free, I don’t want it,” he said. “I don’t want to throw it away anymore.” Prawn noodle seller Tan Kim Leng estimates that only about 3 to 5 per cent of customers ask for wholegrain noodles. While most customers who try the wholegrain noodles enjoy it, he said there are many more who still believe that it will never taste as good as the regular option. “Some of them just don’t want to accept it,” he said. “And when we’re busy, we really don’t have the time to explain to them, or promote it to them.” Mr Tan said he is happy to offer his customers the option but admits that he orders “only a little bit” of the wholegrain noodles from his supplier. While HPB's promotions boosted sales of his wholegrain noodles, Mr Tan admits that it will not be easy to change mindsets. “The discounts will definitely be a boost, but I don’t think it’s long-term,” he said. “I sold up to 80 bowls a day during the promotion period. But with no promotion, I could only sell about seven to 10 bowls a day.” BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD  It has been a tiring few months for Ms Tan and her team. And there are times when the work can be demoralising. “A lot of the hawkers didn’t want to talk to me at first,” she said. “They were like, who are you to come and ask me all these questions?” “It was quite disheartening, because people looked at me like I was some weirdo.” But her work is important: As she understands the various concerns they have, her team has been able to go back to the drawing board and tweak their various campaigns and programmes accordingly. Through feedback from the hawkers she speaks to, she is also able to make adjustments in their approach to help persuade them to come on board. For example, after hearing from hawkers about the difficulties they faced cooking the wholegrain ingredients, she now comes armed with a brochure with detailed cooking instructions. Wholegrain rice and noodle suppliers also sometimes join her on her walkabouts, and some of them are even prepared to offer discounts or promotions to participating hawkers who buy the ingredients. Her efforts are starting to pay off: Currently, 13 of the 59 cooked food stalls at Tiong Bahru Food Centre offer wholegrain options regardless of whether there is a promotion or not. In the last round of promotions HPB ran in April, 30 stalls at the centre offered wholegrain options.  There are also enthusiastic hawkers who are more than willing to give it a shot, such as one kueh seller who greeted Ms Tan warmly, insisting that she sample some of the wholegrain flour kueh he has made. “It’s hard work, but it’s fulfilling,” she said. “It’s about job satisfaction. When you see them selling the wholegrain options, you know that your hard work has paid off.” But she admits that consumer reluctance remains the biggest challenge they face. “We still have a lot of work to do, to increase their awareness, and break some of the myths some of them might have towards wholegrain options,” she said, explaining that the HPB is also utilising other means and channels, such as food trucks at workplaces, to get consumers to overcome their reluctance. “They just need to try it once,” she said. “Then they’ll be more willing to have it again.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wholegrain-options-plenty-of-work-ahead-for-hpb-to-get-hawkers-10544646"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 06:35AM", "tags": ["Vape", "E-cigarettes", "HSA", "MOH"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "28 people caught for vaping since new laws kicked in in February: HSA", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has caught 28 people for using vaporisers in the four months since laws making such devices illegal kicked in in February this year.  Up until February, while the the importation and sale of e-cigarettes were illegal, using, owning and possessing vaporisers remained ungoverned by laws. When asked how these users were caught, a spokesperson for HSA said that in the course of their enforcement duties, its officers will look out for any person who is using these vaporisers, which include e-cigarettes. The act is also called vaping. E-cigarettes carry a nicotine-containing liquid called juice which is heated into a vapour and inhaled. HSA gave the update in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia. From the beginning of January last year to the end of May this year, the authority dealt with 2,161 cases involving the importation of vaporisers and 120 cases involving the sale of such products. Importation includes buying these devices from Malaysia and trying to bring them into Singapore for personal use. Vaporiser peddlers are detected through HSA’s surveillance efforts, feedback from the public, and intelligence shared among partner agencies, the spokesperson added.   “Vaporisers detected via post or checkpoints by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority will be referred to us for investigation,” she said. All confiscated vaporisers are destroyed, she said. Former users that Channel NewsAsia spoke to said they previously ordered the devices from overseas, or brought them in from Malaysia. PROGRESSIVELY TIGHTENED LAWS APPEAR TO HAVE SOME EFFECT The laws appeared to have had an effect on some. Two former e-cigarette users Channel NewsAsia spoke to said that they stopped their habit partly because of the laws. One, of them, a 28-year-old man who did not want to be named, said that he stopped partly because of the fine for bringing in juice from Malaysia, which increased from up to S$5,000 previously to up to S$10,000 for first-time offenders in 2016. He found it too big a sum to take the risk. Another former user, a 32-year-old man, who used to order his supplies from a fellow vape user, said that he also stopped in 2016 once the laws started getting stricter. “It was also due to the difficulty of getting the vape and solution,” he said. However, he said he has started smoking 30 per cent more, after stopping vaping and returning to cigarettes. Psychotherapist Andrew Da Roza who deals with addictions said there are no reliable ways of measuring the current prevalence of e-cigarette use in Singapore and whether the introduction of the law preventing import and sale in 2015 reduced usage or whether the law this year preventing ownership and use had a bigger impact. A simple search online shows that it is difficult for potential users to find information on vaping, a contrast from before. Previously, it was a breeze finding vaporisers and their components on sites like Carousell. Suppliers advertised the sale of such products, despite them being illegal. Information on an e-cigarette forum was also more detailed previously. A visit to the site showed strict instructions on not discussing where to buy juice or vaporisers. A Question & Answer segment for new members warned that these items are illegal in Singapore. “No one is going to tell any Tom, Dick or Harry that walks into this forum such information. Bear in mind that the authorities are watching. We are not being paranoid. They are watching,” it said. NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF E-CIGARETTES Nicotine contained in e-cigarettes is toxic to developing fetuses and can harm adolescent brain development, said Dr Chew Huck Chin, respiratory medicine specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. He added that besides nicotine, which is “highly addictive”, e-cigarette aerosols can contain substances that harm the body.  This includes cancer-causing chemicals and tiny particles that reach deep into lungs. Public health authorities such as the World Health Organization and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have expressed concern that e-cigarettes, like conventional cigarettes, harm users and non-users as they contain cancer-causing chemicals like formaldehyde and fine PM2.5 particulate matter, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. MOH shares the same concern, a spokesperson added. “E-cigarettes and vaporisers can also lead to nicotine addiction and are a potential gateway to cigarette use,\" she said, pointing to \"many authoritative scientific studies\" in the US, United Kingdom and Canada on more than 20,000 youths, that have shown that those who use e-cigarettes were more likely to move on to conventional cigarettes. She also pointed to a recent modelling study by Dartmouth College’s Norris Cotton Cancer Centre, which projected that in the US, e-cigarettes would cause an additional 168,000 teens and young adults to start smoking and become daily smokers. MOH is committed to lowering smoking prevalence in Singapore through a “comprehensive, multipronged approach to discourage and reduce the use of tobacco products”, the spokesperson added. Dr Chew noted said there is \"strong evidence\" that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to traditional cigarettes among youth and young adults whose smoking rates have dropped over the years. CONFLICTING RESEARCH  However, Mr Da Roza said: \"There may be people who are vulnerable to smoking and using e-cigarettes, as well as using alcohol and adopting other destructive behaviours, but one does not cause the other,\" he said.  He added that the cause is the person’s vulnerability to these different behaviours. While many studies warn against vaping, others have said that e-cigarettes contain fewer toxins, and thus lead to lower risks of noncommunicable diseases.  Dr Chew acknowledged that that some data does support that e-cigarette aerosol generally contains fewer toxic chemicals than the smoke from regular cigarettes.  However, one explanation for conflicting information is that the research is still evolving, he added. “There is little that we know about e-cigarettes and just like the data that we now have about tobacco smoking which took many years to evolve, it may take time to be able to fully understand the effects of e-cigarettes,” he said. Still, Dr Chew cautioned that e-cigarette aerosol is not harmless, as it may contain harmful and potentially harmful substances, including nicotine, and heavy metals like lead, volatile organic compounds, and cancer-causing agents, he said.  \"We can’t yet be certain of all the long-term effects across all devices and liquids, so it’s best not to pick up the habit.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/28-people-caught-for-vaping-since-new-laws-kicked-in-in-february-10544428"}, {"datetime": "24 Jul 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["STEM", "education", "science fiction"], "author": "Derrick Chang", "title": "Commentary: We now live in a ‘science fiction world'. We need to boost STEM education", "content": " SINGAPORE: We are in midst of exponential change that seems to spring right out of a science fiction movie. Humanised robots. Self-driving cars, supercomputing and singularity. The fourth industrial revolution characterised by technology, and the fusing of physical, digital and biological worlds, is truly upon us. The question is how prepared are we to live in a world that is constantly reinventing itself? To survive, adapt and be relevant in this brave new world, skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will be imperative.  STEPS LONG TAKEN Long before Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong identified STEM capabilities as critical to ensuring Singapore’s growth for the next 50 years in 2015, Singapore took a step in this direction, through the establishment of Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in 1991. The objective behind A*STAR’s establishment was not just to advance Singapore’s economy but to also grow the biomedical sciences, energy and chemicals, and engineering industries. Two hubs, Biopolis and Fusionopolis, opened in 2003 and 2008 respectively, giving Singapore a competitive edge in research and development (R&D). Then Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan had said at the opening of Biopolis in 2003 that the Biopolis hub was conceived as the cornerstone of a vision to build up the biomedical sciences industry in Singapore, and by doing so, be able to generate economic growth, create jobs and improve the quality of life for Singaporeans. There was also a realisation that the right talent is necessary to capture a share of this knowledge-intensive growth industry for Singapore as the kinds of jobs created and skills in demand evolve. Education plays a crucial role in Singapore’s ability to produce graduates who are not only academically competent, but also equipped with the relevant and practical skills to thrive in this economy of the future. But are we going far enough? GREATER DEMAND FOR STEM EDUCATION According to a survey commissioned by Amgen Asia and the Global STEM Alliance in 2017 among 1,580 secondary school students and 560 teachers, approximately 90 per cent of students in Singapore enjoy one or more STEM subjects and are most likely going to major in one of them post-secondary school. However, the survey also found that there remains a gap in engaging student and equipping teachers. 70 per cent of teachers feel students should be taught how STEM is used in the real world; 84 per cent of students would prefer more hands-on activities, while 78 per cent of them would like access to quality experiments. This notion is echoed by Dr Kwok Sen Wai, a researcher at A*STAR, who said that schools should show students that the skills they learn in science and math classes can help to solve real-life problems. Students need to be inspired to take up STEM courses and ultimately be motivated to create something others can use. In addition to the nuts and bolts – the specific skillsets and hands-on applications – education providers need to instil upon students a desire to upgrade, discover new things and continuously learn. It is through this sort of mindset and our next generation’s appetite for learning that we can grow these capabilities collectively as a country. This is a skillset that even those switching careers midway find valuable. To cite an example from PSB’s School of Life and Physical Sciences, Katherine Liew-Tan runs her own digital branding firm, after completing her communications studies at Nanyang Technological University. But her keen interest in exploring potential business opportunities as she works closely with her clients from major skincare companies drove her to pursue a Bachelor of Science (Pharmaceutical Science) with La Trobe University, so she can cater to her clients’ needs better. STEM EDUCATION FOR ASEAN Singapore’s role as ASEAN’s chair this year weighs in heavily in this conversation, with the theme being “Resilient and Innovation”. Countries are looking to partner Singapore as the region looks to move up the innovation ladder. Nations like Indonesia are already seeing benefits from harnessing technological disruption, from retail to telecommunications, as they reap fruits of new business models and job opportunities. This is where they can partner with countries like Singapore which has natural strengths in STEM education. Singapore also tops Asia for developing human capital while countries such as Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia trail behind despite improvements from previous years, based on a World Economic Forum 2017 Human Capital Index. A global talent shortage is making investments in education, including a focus on lifelong learning and high-skilled opportunities pressing, says WEF founder and executive Chairman Klaus Schwab. On Singapore’s part, it is not enough for the country to be pioneering national initiatives such as Smart Nation and SkillsFuture. It requires close collaboration with its neighbouring countries to strengthen ASEAN’s ability to capitalise on these technological trends to move forward collectively. A shining example of effective regional collaboration in STEM education is the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative which completed its latest STEM Education Regional Workshop in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The Workshop saw over 50 youths aged 18 to 25 from Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Laos, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam discuss STEM education in the region. BUILDING STEM CAPABILITIES  Similar initiatives are required with commitment and consistency. Singapore should work with other ASEAN countries and industry experts, and governments to deepen the region’s STEM capabilities. There is also a role for tripartite partners including companies to play in STEM education. Employers need to embrace and advocate lifelong learning and society needs to celebrate and recognise a broad range of achievements. Industry champions in STEM sectors can play a more active and direct role through offering expertise as adjunct lecturers, curating meaningful attachments and internship opportunities, and embracing lifelong learning by providing training for employees. With strong support from partners, education providers can build a link for students to network and learn from industry practitioners. In turn, these partners can tap on students’ talents and qualifications, in matching talent with roles in STEM. The end goal is for the region to build STEM capabilities, to contribute to ASEAN’s vision of becoming a dynamic, connected and growing region. Our future depends on it.

At the same time, however, Grab has lowered the threshold for members to qualify for its Silver, Gold, and Platinum membership tiers.   Most regular Grab users Channel NewsAsia spoke to criticised the changes, and many acknowledged that there were limited viable alternatives for them to turn to.  Brandon Wee, a 34-year-old Grab Gold member, told Channel NewsAsia that he used to earn 240 points for each ride from his home to the office. However, last Friday, he noticed that the same ride, which usually costs S$15, earned him only around 60 points. Following the revision, Gold members who used to earn 16 points for every S$1 spent will earn just 4.5 points now. The point exchange rate before Friday's revision was 16 times across all membership tiers for GrabPay, and eight times across all tiers with cash payment. \"It's an outrage. I use the points to redeem cash rebates that I'll activate for my subsequent rides, but it's so difficult now to collect enough points,\" said Mr Wee.  \"It just gets harder to benefit from the system. The sad thing is, it's not like I can stop this and turn to Uber,\" he added.  Grab's revision of its rewards system came almost four months after it acquired rival Uber's Southeast Asia operations. The deal between Grab and Uber recently came into the spotlight after Singapore's competition watchdog said earlier this month it has resulted in \"substantial lessening of competition\" in ride-hailing platforms, making it harder for new players to enter the market, and resulted in higher prices.  Commenting on this, engineer Abdul Razak, who uses Grab to commute daily, told Channel NewsAsia that he believes the company is able to revise its points system with \"little impact on its market share\" because it is the only \"large scale ride-hailing firm\" left in Singapore.  Mr Abdul Razak highlighted that following the recent revision, points needed to redeem a S$5 cash rebate for the subsequent Grab ride has increased for Silver, Gold and Platinum members.  Previously, Silver, Gold and Platinum members needed 2,100, 2,000 and 1,900 points respectively to redeem the rebate. Regular members needed 2,200 points.  Following the revision, members across all tiers need 2,220 points to redeem the same rebate.  Mr Abdul Razak, who is a Platinum member, said: \"It defeats the purpose of us paying so much to earn that high tier membership. It's like they no longer care about loyalty, (they) should just do away with the tier system then.\"  BETTER EXCHANGE RATE FOR GRABFOOD, GRABPAY PURCHASES  Despite the cons, some users said that the revisions have been positive in certain aspects, especially in terms of GrabFood and GrabPay in-store purchases. Bank officer Celena Tan, who works at Marina One, told Channel NewsAsia that when she uses GrabPay to purchase a bun from a bakery near her office for S$1.50, she now receives eight points for GrabRewards, when she would have received an \"insignificant\" number of points prior to the revision.   \"(The changes) are useful for people who utilise GrabFood and GrabPay for merchant payments,\" said the 30-year-old, who also uses Grab rides three to four times weekly.  She felt that the revised policies have made it easier for users to ascend membership tiers, giving users a low threshold to qualify for Gold or Platinum memberships.  \"Now, becoming a Platinum member is quite an achievable target ... there is a low threshold and it's good,\" she added.  Ms Tan, however, acknowledged that the way Grab communicated the revisions in its reward system could have been better, as she only realised the changes after noticing a large decrease in points received after a ride.  \"I think there wasn’t too much publicity, it wasn’t something that people were looking forward to ... more can be done to raise awareness about this,\" she said. \"If it's (Grab's) intention to move towards GrabFood and merchant payments, it's good to let customers know.\"  Despite the changes, Ms Tan said that she will continue using Grab.  \"We don't have much of a choice ... the (GrabReward) scheme makes them more attractive. Uber used to have a rewards system, now it's just Grab.

Database administrators from the Integrated Health Information System (IHIS) detected unusual activity on SingHealth’s IT systems on Jul 4 and put a stop to the data breach activities. It was later that they found out data had been illegally copied and stolen beginning from Jun 27 – eight days before the cyberattack was detected. From Jul 4 to Jul 9, the administrators continued to monitor the network traffic closely before ascertaining it was a cyberattack and alerted their superiors. On Jul 10, MOH, SingHealth and the Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA) were informed and forensic investigations carried out. Mr Jonathan Phua, the co-founder of startup InsiderSecurity, which specialises in early breach detection, told Channel NewsAsia that if an attacker was able to hide in an IT system long enough to steal 1.5 million patients’ records, then the time taken to detect and respond to the threat was “too long”. But, Mr Phua said it is not easy to detect a sophisticated attacker hiding inside the system, especially if it is state-sponsored – something that other industry experts have stated was a likelihood. The former DSO National Laboratories researcher pointed to the 2017 Equifax breach, when the personal data of around 150 million US consumers was lost, which was discovered only three months later. Another incident involving the US Office of Personnel Management saw around 20 million employee records stolen in 2015, and that was discovered a year later, he added.   HACK DISCLOSURE A \"NOBLE THING TO DO\" Darktrace Asia Pacific managing director Sanjay Aurora said last Friday when news of the hack came to light that for SingHealth to have detected, investigated and reported the incident within a month was a “comparative success”. “How many other countries around the world are capable of even detecting this attack within a month, let alone be able to conduct a full investigation in this short time period?\" Mr Aurora said. Mr Jeff Hurmuses, managing director of Asia Pacific at US-based cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes, also concluded that the IHIS database administrators acted \"promptly\" to stem the data leak. \"They actually responded to the breach and disclosed it to potentially affected users very quickly,\" he said. FireEye’s Asia Pacific president Eric Hoh lauded the Singapore Government’s decision to notify the public of the SingHealth hack. “CSA and the Singapore Government have done a good job detecting (the cyberattack) in a timely manner and publicly disclosing the incident – which is a very noble thing to do,” Mr Hoh told Channel NewsAsia, adding that the tendency is there for victims to “sweep the matter under the rug”.  Mr Bill Chang, Singtel's CEO for Group Enterprise, which includes cybersecurity company Trustwave, also said the fact that Government agencies managed to detect, confirm, isolate and mitigate the threat \"within just a few days is a robust response\". He added that for advance persistent threat (APT) attacks, the median for companies to detect sophisticated breaches is more than 100 days and they can take up to 60 days to respond and mitigate the breach.  Mr Rajesh Sreenivasan, head of Technology, Media and Telecommunications at Rajah & Tann, said in a phone interview that it is “near impossible” to judge if the Singapore authorities had responded to the detection of the breach in a timely manner without knowing the specifics. “The reality is that (the) breach notification could be done in stages,” Mr Sreenivasan said. He added: “Sometimes, the cyberattacks could be part of a larger series of attacks, and notifying the public too early could compromise investigations.” The lawyer also responded to questions over whether IHIS failed to comply with the Cybersecurity Act, which requires owners of critical information infrastructure in 11 key sectors – of which healthcare is part of – to notify Singapore’s cybersecurity commissioner of “a prescribed cybersecurity incident”, among others. It does not state a timeframe for reporting incidents. Mr Sreenivasan pointed out that IHIS did not fall foul of the law because the legislation is not yet in force. Mr Bryan Tan, partner at Pinsent Masons, agreed, adding that the timeframe for notification has not been set.  He did point out that, on a general level, it is a “fair question” why the regulators and affected people were not informed of the data breach earlier. He also questioned why the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), which has been investigating data breaches here, does not appear to be involved in this particular case. COMMON DATA LAWS FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS? Another issue that was raised after the SingHealth hack was how consumers have no clear recourse when a data breach or violation involves a government entity, since the public sector is not included under the country’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Mr Sreenivasan said it is also unclear which entity is regulated under the law and which is not. The cyberattack on SingHealth was just one of several that had targeted public sector agencies. In April this year, four Singapore universities were victims of online attacks, with at least 52 online accounts breached to obtain research articles without authorisation.  In April 2017, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University were hit by IT network breaches, while that same year, the Ministry of Defence revealed its I-net system was attacked and the personal data of 850 national servicemen and employees was stolen. Mr Tan said: “The impression given is that the biggest data breaches seem to involve government agencies (schools, MINDEF) and with the lack of details provided, one can only wonder whether the internal data protection standards adopted are sufficient given the higher risk profile.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-did-authorities-respond-fast-enough-to-10555632"}, {"datetime": "23 Jul 2018 05:49PM", "tags": ["crime", "immigration"], "author": "", "title": "3 Sri Lankan men sentenced to 8 months' jail for forged Malaysia visas", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three Sri Lankan men were on Friday (Jul 20) sentenced to eight months' jail for having forged Malaysia visas in their passports.

However, when the three men were departing Singapore at Woodlands Checkpoint, officers conducted further checks and arrested them after detecting anomalies in their Malaysia visas. Rajanikanth had left Singapore before investigations began, while evidence indicated that the Malaysian taxi driver was uninvolved in this scam, said ICA. \"The ICA takes a serious view of persons possessing a false travel document or abetting others to be in possession of one,\" the authority added.

This follows the implementation of ISS at SingHealth on Friday, which was in response to the major unprecedented cyberattack on its IT system, in which Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was a target. With NHG and NUHS both adopting the safeguard measure, all public healthcare clusters are now delinked from Internet surfing.  \"The decision to impose ISS is part of the effort of the public healthcare family to strengthen its IT systems against evolving cyber security threats, and more importantly, to safeguard the confidentiality of our patients’ data,\" said the Ministry of Health (MOH). \"We would like to assure all patients that their safety and care are our priority, and we will work to ensure that these are not compromised as a result of the implementation of ISS and various security measures,\" it added. In addition to ISS, other measures that have been put in place to improve IT security include additional controls on workstations and servers, reset of user and systems accounts, and the installation of additional system monitoring controls on IT systems, according to MOH's release. The move comes after an unprecedented cyberattack at SingHealth, which saw 1.5 million patients' records accessed and copied. Of those patients, 160,000 had their outpatient dispensed medicines' records taken.  The news of the cyberattack was announced on Jul 20. EXPECT DELAYS SAYS MOH MOH also cautioned that during this period, patients may experience longer waiting times for consultations, test results and delays in checking their Medisave accounts or making claims, MOH said. This is because public healthcare institutions rely on accessing other systems through the Internet to deliver multiple services, including the reading of diagnostic reports from laboratories, submission and retrieval of results from screening databases, and birth and death registrations. As such, some public healthcare institutions, including the polyclinics and community hospitals, will be affected. As an interim alternative, departments that require Internet access will have to share separate workstations for connection to the Internet. NHG said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia that Internet surfing has been delinked for all corporate-issued devices. Staff, however, are still able to use the Internet in the office via NHG Internet-enabled, standalone laptops. These laptops, which are not linked to the corporate network system, are distributed to departments that need to access information for work via the Internet, it said. \"There will be initial inconvenience to patients, staff and the public during this period. We seek everyone's patience and kind understanding should they experience some delays or inconvenience,\" said Mr Ho Khai Leng, Group Chief Information Officer, NHG. LONGER TURNAROUND TIMES For NUHS and its hospitals, some of the financial assistance and routine claims for bills that are done on websites will now have to be prioritised, planned and scheduled to be done in batches, which may result in a longer turnaround time, a spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia.  \"There are some vendor managed systems that depend on Internet access and some modifications to workflow will have to be implemented,\" the spokesperson said in response to queries.  NUHS is also working with partners to boost the bandwidth and coverage of Wireless@SG at its premises. NUHS also said that most of its IT systems run off the corporate network and was not affected by the Internet separation. These include their major clinical systems and applications such as electronic health records and patient care services situated within its intranet.   \"There will be some inconvenience for patients and healthcare staff, as a result of the unavailability of some IT system connections that require the Internet,\" MOH said. \"We seek the understanding of patients and the public as our teams work through the issues that arise on the ground,\" the ministry added.  Senior Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min visited Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Monday to observe the operational impact of ISS on the ground and said that he was happy to note that patient care was not affected. In a Facebook post, he said: \"TTSH staff are taking the various inconveniences and administrative challenges in their stride while interim alternatives are being deployed.\" SingHealth has also contacted patients who visited SingHealth's specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics between May 1, 2015, and Jul 4 this year to inform them if their data was affected. More than 700,000 patients had received SMS notifications from the healthcare group as of Saturday.  \n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-internet-surfing-delinked-all-public-10555094"}, {"datetime": "23 Jul 2018 04:45PM", "tags": ["NTUC FairPrice", "environment"], "author": "", "title": "NTUC FairPrice scraps 10-cent BYOB rebate, launches new scheme to reduce plastic bag use", "content": " SINGAPORE: NTUC FairPrice on Monday (Jul 23) announced the launch of the “FairPrice Plastic Bag Management Programme”, a framework that looks to holistically reduce plastic bag use. The programme, which was developed following a review conducted earlier this year, will replace the existing FairPrice Green Rewards Scheme on Aug 1. First introduced in 2007, the scheme offered customers a rebate of S$0.10 for bringing their own bags to shop at FairPrice stores. “While there has been an increase in the number of plastic bags saved since the FairPrice Green Rewards Scheme was introduced in 2007, progress has plateaued out – averaging at about 10.8 million bags saved per year in the last three years,” FairPrice said in a media release. The new Plastic Bag Management Programme now targets to save 30 million plastic bags per year by 2030. NTUC FairPrice CEO, Mr Seah Kian Peng said: “For more than a decade, FairPrice has championed the Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB) movement in Singapore where we have invested more than S$4 million - through the FairPrice Green Rewards scheme - to urge the community to use fewer plastic bags. “We will continue to drive this national initiative and focus on a holistic and scalable framework that aims to address the wider impact of plastic bag use on the environment, while taking into consideration customer needs and habits.  \"Through this renewed commitment, we look to galvanise the community, industry partners, interest groups and government agencies to create a greater collective impact in protecting our environment.” The FairPrice Plastic Bag Management Programme will take a four-pronged approach in its efforts to reduce plastic bag usage. Firstly, it will review internal processes and implement policies and practices to trim plastic bag packaging in operations. Enhanced environmentally-friendly bagging practices will also be introduced for cashiers. Shoppers will be encouraged to reduce their use of plastic bags and embrace an eco-friendly lifestyle through public education programmes.  FairPrice will work with both governmental and non-governmental organisations to jointly produce and implement education programmes. Among other efforts, FairPrice will support an upcoming public education campaign by Zero Waste SG to raise awareness of BYOB. FairPrice will also increase investment and continued support for whole-of-nation efforts to reduce plastic bag use.  FairPrice is currently working with Nanyang Polytechnic on activating students from the Nanyang Polytechnic Foundation Programme to design a reusable bag for public distribution.  Beyond this, FairPrice will also work with suppliers and manufacturers to explore better packaging design and material. S$50,000 DONATION TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES In its media release, FairPrice also said it will make donations to organisations who exemplify efforts to promote sustainable practices locally.  FairPrice has since committed S$50,000 to the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Zero Waste SG to fund their sustainability efforts. “We are very grateful for this long-term collaboration and partnership with NTUC FairPrice towards SEC’s call for action for joint sustainable programmes,\" said SEC Executive Director, Ms Jen Teo.   \"The BYOB programme, which started over a decade ago, has resulted in a remarkable reduction of plastic bags use.  \"We shall be announcing many new joint programmes shortly and look forward to working closely with NTUC FairPrice to continue our efforts in 3P partnerships connecting businesses, communities, school and individuals to take action.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntuc-fairprice-scraps-10-cent-byob-rebate-launches-new-scheme-to-10555202"}, {"datetime": "23 Jul 2018 04:39PM", "tags": ["Consumers Association of Singapore"], "author": "", "title": "Pressure selling rampant in slimming, beauty industry: CASE", "content": " SINGAPORE: Complaints against the pressure sales tactics adopted by the slimming, beauty and hair industries are \"significantly higher\" compared to other industries, said the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) on Monday (Jul 23), as it warned customers to be wary of them. Last year, they accounted for 44 per cent of complaints received on the slimming industry. Such complaints made up for 16 per cent and 21 per cent of complaints against the hair and beauty industries respectively, said CASE in an advisory.  Complaints about sales tactics generally account for less than 5 per cent for other industries, it added. \"The use of high pressure sales tactics has been a recurring problem in the slimming, beauty and hair industries for many years,\" said CASE.  \"Consumers should be aware that they always have the right to say 'no' to such tactics and can simply walk away if they feel uncomfortable,\" it added.  Some of the unacceptable sales tactics commonly encountered include consumers being barred from leaving by the salesperson until they agree to buy a product or stopping treatment midway unless the consumer agrees to the purchase. \"The exertion of undue pressure on a consumer to enter into a transaction involving goods or services is prohibited under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) and consumers can seek recourse under it,\" said CASE.   The consumer watchdog added that it has been actively encouraging businesses in these industries to voluntarily commit themselves to ethical business practices by signing up for CaseTrust accreditation. \"Accredited businesses are subjected to a rigorous audit to assess their conformance to the accreditation criteria, which includes price transparency, well-trained sales staff with ethical sales tactics and prepayment protection amongst others.\" CASE said that consumers who plan to purchase slimming, beauty and/or hair products or services should be cautious about entering a transaction with businesses that do not provide important documents like invoices or sales agreements.  Consumers should also make informed decisions and not be fooled by \"special discount\" or \"one-time only\" offers.

The automated quay crane (AQC) system moves containers from vessels that are berthed at Pasir Panjang Terminal onto prime movers. These cranes are unmanned at the site and are monitored remotely from a control centre. Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan was given a tour around the terminal on Monday morning, where he was briefed by PSA staff on how the AQC has helped operations.  PSA said there are currently three AQCs on trial. The cranes were purchased from Chinese equipment manufacturing company ZPMC. PSA said it is aiming for the AQCs to be fully operational when the Tuas mega port is completed in 2040.  At Tuas, the AQCs will be complemented by automated guided vehicles (AGVs), self-driving machines that facilitate movement of shipments at the port. The AQCs will transfer containers to the AGVs The containers picked up by the AQC from vessels will be transferred to the self-driving AGVs, to allow for efficient transportation of goods without the need for any operator or engineer to be physically present. Pasir Panjang Terminal has 30 AGVs being trialled - eight of which are hybrid while 22 are fully battery operated. The vehicles are being used to transport containers from overhead bridge cranes, which are semi-automated.  Mr Eddy Ng, managing director of PSA Singapore, said that one key challenge faced by the company is in preparing its staff to operate the AQC. PSA currently has 40 operators who can handle AQCs and the company plans to eventually train all of its 500-600 operators to be able to use it. The mechanical cranes currently being used require operators to be stationed on the crane itself, working in a booth which is 17 storeys high, while operators for the AQCs are stationed in a remote air-conditioned office. Mr Lee Poh Ann, a container equipment specialist who has worked at PSA for 25 years, told media that he was initially not confident of operating the AQC, but became proficient after guidance from his instructor.  \"Working in the office is better because we can enjoy the air-conditioning and comfort,\" he said with a chuckle.  Additionally, Mr Ng also highlighted that some ships still do not have the tools that are compatible with automation. \"One example of a challenge we face is the (securing) of containers onboard ships. This represents a key challenge because the tools are mechanised tools and yet to be subjected to automation and technology,\" Mr Ng said.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/automated-quay-crane-system-on-trial-at-pasir-panjang-terminal-10554856"}, {"datetime": "23 Jul 2018 02:39PM", "tags": ["OCBC", "banking"], "author": "", "title": "OCBC to roll out new digital service kiosks, replacing bank tellers", "content": " SINGAPORE: OCBC Bank will be rolling out more digital service kiosks that act like \"mini-branches\" and phasing out bank tellers, said the bank in a news release on Monday (Jul 23).

OCBC currently has 51 branches in Singapore, and by 2020, about 35 of the bank's branches will have the digital service kiosks.

According to a joint press release on Monday (Jul 23), both parties will launch what they tout as Singapore’s first 5G pilot network at one-north by the fourth quarter of the year. The trials will be carried out at one-north and other designated areas, it added. The 5G pilot network is using airwaves allocated by the Info-Communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), which both parties said will enable the transfer of terabytes of data in minutes and 4K video downloads in seconds.  These capabilities will transform sectors such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, they said. The announcement came during an event to demonstrate the possibilities of the network on Monday, with Singtel and Ericsson showcasing things like viewing the human anatomy in augmented reality (AR) and streamed in real-time to a remote audience using the 5G network. This, they said, shows the possibilities of using three-dimension (3D) AR in various industries like medical and education. “This is an encouraging step towards commercialisation with live 5G trial networks made possible with the regulatory sandbox IMDA has in place,” said Ms Aileen Chia, deputy chief executive and director-general (Telecoms & Post) at IMDA. “IMDA will continue to work closely with mobile service providers such as Singtel in their journey to build communication capabilities of the future and complement Singapore’s efforts towards a vibrant digital economy.” Singtel is not the only one looking to stay ahead of the competition with the next-generation mobile network, which has been heavily touted to revolutionise our daily lives.

It was very stuffy and very cramped … all the delegates who were interested were crammed in there.” The snowstorm turned out to be a blessing in disguise. \"On that day, we resolved a lot of the issues that had been sticking points for many years. We all just came with a spirit of co-operation, so it was very collaborative and people were very open about things,” said Ms Ong. “It’s very special because that day was quite a breakthrough.” Ms Ong was Singapore’s representative for the UNCITRAL Working Group on Dispute Settlement. Three years of negotiations have successfully resulted in the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation. The treaty will be signed in August 2019 in Singapore, and will thus be named the Singapore Convention on Mediation. This is the first treaty under the UN to be named after Singapore. THE CONVENTION There are three ways that businesses can seek legal recourse for commercial disputes – arbitration, litigation, and mediation. But a key difficulty in cross-border disputes – when a business in one country has a dispute with an entity in another country – is enforceability. In other words, there is no guarantee that either party will stick to their side of the outcome. That is why countries must come to a multilateral agreement to mutually enforce the outcomes of such disputes, whether through arbitration, litigation, or mediation. While the New York Convention exists for arbitration, and the Hague Convention for litigation, such a multilateral agreement did not exist for mediation. As a result, mediation was not a useful tool for businesses to seek recourse for international disputes. MEDIATION However, mediation gives all parties the most autonomy in deciding the outcome of a dispute, and seeks a win-win outcome for all sides, compared to the other two methods. It also tends to be cheaper, faster and more convenient. “Cheaper not just because of the dispute resolution process itself, but a lot of the time today, the uncertainty of the outcome of a dispute resolution process is imputed in the costs upstream,” said Mrs Natalie Morris-Sharma. \"So when you can ascertain with a bit more foresight how you think your dispute resolution process is going to go, it allows you to approach things with a lot more certainty. So that’s one avenue of the costs savings.” Mrs Morris-Sharma chaired the UNCITRAL Working Group of Dispute Settlement and was also the vice-chairperson of the UNCITRAL Commission sessions in 2017 and 2018. Her role was “shepherding” members from more than a hundred delegations into coming to a consensus while meeting the United Nation’s timeline targets. Delegations came to the table with different experiences with mediation, and perspectives on how enforcement should be achieved.  “In any process that involves reaching a common understanding of how processes should be approached, delegations had to consider how this new system would fit in with their domestic processes,” said Mrs Morris-Sharma, who is also director of the international legal division at Singapore's Ministry of Law. “Thankfully I think we managed to strike a balance between the divergent views through the Singapore Convention.” When ratified by countries around the world, the Convention will encourage businesses around the world to resolve their commercial disputes peacefully, as opposed to seeking arbitration or litigation.  And the treaty will raise Singapore's standing in the world as a location for dispute resolution. Law Minister K Shanmugam said on Monday: \"Anytime people talk about mediation, they will look up the international treaty and they will know there's a Singapore Convention (on Mediation). So automatically Singapore will have mindshare amongst the profession, amongst the people who want to go for mediation. \"We must make sure we have the mediators, both local and international, and we have the lawyers who are capable of handling mediation and advising parties and be actively involved.\" In 2017, Singapore enacted a Mediation Act to allow parties to enforce mediated settlement agreements more easily. It has also set up the Singapore Mediation Centre, the Singapore International Mediation Centre, the Singapore International Mediation Institute, and the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/un-mediation-treaty-to-be-signed-in-and-named-after-singapore-10554862"}, {"datetime": "23 Jul 2018 01:35PM", "tags": ["Apple", "iTunes", "cybersecurity"], "author": "Nurul Azliah Aripin", "title": "Apple iTunes fraudulent charges: Banks continue to assist victims as more cases come to light", "content": " SINGAPORE: Banks in Singapore said they have responded with measures to assist victims after a series of fraudulent Apple iTunes transactions affected dozens of account holders. The victims reported that hundreds to thousands of dollars were wiped from their debit accounts and charged to their credit cards from banks including Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), DBS and HSBC. Apple Singapore, on Friday (Jul 20), told Channel NewsAsia that it was looking into the matter. The company also highlighted its support page for customers to report any problems with purchases made on iTunes. United Overseas Bank (UOB) told Channel NewsAsia on Sunday that it increased its monitoring of iTunes transactions in the previous week.  \"Where our system detected a potentially fraudulent transaction, we immediately called our customer to check with them on the transaction,\" said UOB, adding that it would help a customer claim a refund once the fraudulent transaction is confirmed. A new card would also be issued as an additional security measure, UOB said.  At OCBC alone, there were 58 cases of fraudulent transactions in July. \"In early July, we detected and investigated unusual transactions on 58 cardholders' accounts. Upon confirmation that these were fraudulent transactions, we deployed the necessary counter-measures and are currently assisting the affected cardholders via the chargeback process,\" said Mr Vincent Tan, head of credit cards at OCBC Bank.  DBS customers who report unauthorised iTunes transactions would receive a temporary credit while the bank investigates the charge dispute, the bank told Channel NewsAsia.   \"Banking security is of foremost concern to us and we use industry-leading security technology and protocols to ensure that our customers' information and money are safe,\" said a DBS spokesperson. \"We also constantly monitor credit/debit card transactions in real time for any suspicious activities.\" Channel NewsAsia has reached out to HSBC and Standard Chartered for comment. FRAUDULENT iTUNES CHARGES WORTH MORE THAN S$1,000 Since Channel NewsAsia's first report on the fraudulent iTunes charges on Sunday, more have taken to social media to share their plight, with some even hit by transactions amounting to around S$7,000. One of the victims, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Channel NewsAsia that more than S$7,000 worth of iTunes transactions were charged to her HSBC credit card.  She discovered the transactions on the previous day after receiving an SMS notification from the bank informing her that her credit card limit was left with \"less than 30 per cent\". \"I don't have any records of those unauthorised transactions as they (had) told me over the phone. I will see it when my statement comes next month,\" she said.  She added that she was referred to a senior adviser when she contacted Apple, who \"repeatedly\" told her that the company was unable to refund the disputed amount.  \"This is a case of credit card fraud, which is not due to Apple and/or iTunes at all,\" she said, citing the Apple staff.  She was also told that her credit card may have been used for online purchases other than Apple, resulting in the fraudulent transactions, said the victim. She uses her card for purchases on Apple's App Store, she said. Sales manager Nicholas Tan, 31, was charged more than S$2,000 to his HSBC credit card in May. Each of the fraudulent iTunes transactions costs S$148.98, he said.  \"The bank called me to verify if I had made those transactions. I was not even in Singapore,\" Mr Tan said. \"HSBC was fast. They noticed those transactions and called me immediately. I missed their first call but they called me the next day to follow up,\" said Mr Tan. Another victim, Mr Wilson Wong, 26, is currently waiting for refunds worth nearly S$2,000 after a total of 12 fraudulent iTunes transactions were charged to his OCBC debit card on Jul 13.  \"Just disappointed with OCBC.

June's rate - the highest since November last year, which also saw a rise to 0.6 per cent - was largely due to higher food and services inflation. Food inflation rose to 1.5 per cent in June from 1.3 per cent in May, as a faster pace of increase in the prices of non-cooked food items more than offset a slower pace of increase in the prices of prepared meals, said the two bodies. Services inflation edged up to 1.7 per cent in June from 1.6 per cent in the previous month, largely due to a stronger pick-up in holiday expenses as well as a rise in telecommunications services fees following the year-ago decline in May. In addition, the overall cost of retail items increased by 1.6 per cent in June, larger than the 1.3 per cent rise in May.  This mostly reflected a faster pace of increase in the prices of clothing and footwear, medical products, appliances and equipment, as well as a smaller year-ago decline in the prices of household durable goods, said MAS and MTI.

Chua got into his taxi and accelerated at a high speed, court documents said. He drove across a zebra crossing without stopping or giving way to pedestrians, almost hitting two of them as a result. After realising there was a kerb in front, Chua tried to swerve right to avoid it and ended up mounting the kerb. He then lost control of his vehicle, which ploughed into a valet at high speed, causing him to smash into the taxi's windscreen before being hurled back several metres.

Naveenthiran Thevathas, 21, had arrived intoxicated on Thursday and was scolded sharply by the judge, who put him in remand. On Monday, Naveenthiran stood sober in the dock as the judge sentenced him to four years and two months in jail and three strokes of the cane. He had extorted S$2,000 from a 17-year-old boy by threatening to disseminate a video of the teenager having sex with an 18-year-old girl.  Naveenthiran, along with two other accomplices, had asked the teenager to deliver S$50,000 in cash, but the boy gave them only S$2,000 on Feb 15 this year. Naveenthiran was also sentenced for one charge of stealing a POSB Passion Debit Card at an ATM machine at Woodlands MRT. On Monday, the defence said Naveenthiran \"realises his mistake\" and \"has the ability to change\". \"Though he turned up drunk, we submit that he did turn up to court,\" said the defence, asking for a sentence that was \"not crushing\". Addressing the charges, District Judge Kenneth Yap said: \"Well, if he has the courage to commit an offence of this nature, then he should have the courage to face the consequences. He's lucky that I didn't forfeit the (S$20,000) bail.\" The judge then spoke to Naveenthiran: \"From your record, you have been in juvenile home since you were 14, and reformative training since you were 18. All this obviously has not had an impact on you. You have not learnt your lesson.\" He agreed with the prosecution's recommended sentence, saying that the heavier sentence was justified, as there was \"clearly premeditation\" and the extortion plan was \"quite sophisticated\". The defence asked for the jail term to be backdated to when Naveenthiran was placed in remand, but the judge declined to do so, saying that \"that is the price you pay for coming to court intoxicated\". Addressing Naveenthiran further, the judge said he had read a letter his mother had written, in which she explained the circumstances that his family faces. \"While I sympathise, it does not justify the crime,\" said the judge. \"Just because you have difficulties in your life, that does not justify (the crime). In the end, the victim here is yourself and your family.\"  \"If you commit this kind of offences again, it will be an even heavier sentence,\" he warned.

After being treated to the historical super blue blood moon in January, astronomy enthusiasts in Singapore are looking forward to the longest total lunar eclipse of the century on Jul 28, which also coincides with the Mars opposition.  This means that skywatchers will be able to gaze at both planet Mars and a total lunar eclipse at the same time.  The lunar eclipse begins in the wee hours of Jul 28 morning, from 1.14am, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The total lunar eclipse will last one hour and 43 minutes and can be viewed from 3.30am to 5.13am. That is only four minutes shy of the longest possible duration for a total lunar eclipse, which is one hour and 47 minutes, according to Mr Albert Ho, president of the Astronomy Society of Singapore (TASOS).   The last time a total lunar eclipse lasted nearly as long was on Jul 16, 2000, with a total duration of one hour and 46 minutes, according to NASA's data.  Similar to the super blue blood moon, the moon on Jul 28 will appear red during the eclipse. However, it will also appear smaller this time.  \"This total lunar eclipse also coincides with the lunar apogee when the moon is furthest from the earth,\" said Dr Abel Yang, a lecturer from the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore. \"At apogee, the moon will appear slightly smaller because it is farther from the Earth. This is the opposite effect of a supermoon.\" The moon also moves slower when it is farthest from Earth, said Dr Yang. This explains its long duration.  The total lunar eclipse will also coincide with the Mars opposition, said Mr Remus Chua, an astrophotographer and founder of the Singapore Astronomy Forum (SingAstro). The opposition takes place every two years or so and occurs when Mars, Earth and the Sun form a straight line during the course of their orbits, he added.  When this happens, Mr Chua said Mars will be \"about five times brighter than usual\" and this will make visual observations through telescopes \"easy and interesting\".  Mars will also appear as a \"reddish star close to the moon\", according to Mr Ho. A Science Centre Singapore spokesman said Mars will come very close to the moon in the early morning of Jul 28.  GETTING READY FOR THE ECLIPSE, MARS Several astronomy events will take place in Singapore from the evening of Jul 27 to the morning of Jul 28.  All spots for a special viewing event by the Science Centre have been snapped up, a spokesman said, with a total of 120 adults and 80 children aged seven to 12 registered for the free event funded by SkillsFuture. There is also a long waiting list of people who are interested in the event - held at the Lifelong Learning Institute - but have not registered, the spokesman added.  At another special viewing, about 500 people are expected to turn up at Marina South Pier for the MARS-LE: Mars opposition and Lunar Eclipse event organised by SingAstro. Twelve telescopes will be available at the venue.  Meanwhile, TASOS will be giving a talk on eclipses at the Science Centre Observatory classroom on Jul 27. Several photographers are also expected to capture images of the eclipse and Mars. However, capturing an image of the moon this time might be trickier since it will be smaller than the super blue blood moon, a name coined for the combination of a blue moon, a supermoon and a total lunar eclipse.  \"The lunar eclipse or blood moon is the iconic image of the phenomena and you'll need a long telephoto lens of around 300mm and a sturdy tripod to (capture the image),\" said photographer Joe Nair.  A high-resolution camera would be a bonus, he added. \"The moon moves faster than you think. Without a decently high shutter speed of at least 1/80 sec, there will be motion blur.\" He added: \"The good news about the upcoming eclipse is that you have a lot of time to work out the settings that will work best.\" The total lunar eclipse on Jul 28 can also be viewed from South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, according to NASA.  The next total lunar eclipse will take place on Jan 21 next year but will not be visible from Singapore as it will happen during daylight, said Dr Yang. Science Centre said that the moon in the next lunar eclipse will stay red for only 62 minutes.  Singapore will have to wait until May 26, 2021, for the next total lunar eclipse visible from the country, said TASOS. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/longest-total-lunar-eclipse-mars-singapore-jul-28-10543226"}, {"datetime": "23 Jul 2018 06:26AM", "tags": ["work-life balance", "motivation", "office", "employment", "job"], "author": "Peter Cheng", "title": "Commentary: Stuck in a pointless job, many employees are tuning out", "content": " SINGAPORE: It’s 9am and you’ve just entered the office. You hear a sigh behind you, alerting you to the arrival of your colleague, Raymond.  “Why so sad in the morning”, you ask. Raymond gives another sigh before replying: There’s nothing to look forward to except drafting reports and editing slides. There’s no point in drafting these things anyway - it doesn’t help anyone and no one needs them.  Over lunch, Raymond tells you how he’s tired of his job and of spending time doing mundane tasks that have little impact and recognition. He cites recent developments in artificial intelligence and suggests how many parts of his job can actually be automated. He dreams of leaving his job to pursue a career in the creative industry. Sounds familiar? Raymond’s not alone. There are a growing number of employees complaining about being stuck in pointless jobs.  The phenomenon is so popular in fact that anthropologist David Graeber’s article about it in 2013 became a viral hit. This begs the question – is there really such a thing as a pointless job? WHY WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A POINTLESS JOB According to anthropologist David Graeber, a pointless job (or b***sh** job) is one that can be erased from the Earth without affecting anyone adversely. To him, these are jobs that do not have any intrinsic value, such as jobs in sectors such as telemarketing, corporate law and human resources. These jobs are pointless because there is no reason to justify the existence of the job but people have to pretend that there is a reason for it to exist. It is this dichotomy that leads to the feeling of a pointless job. However, unlike what Graeber suggests, it is unlikely that most jobs are pointless in themselves. While there could be some truth to the fact that there may be pointless jobs out there, such as jobs that exist to fill redundancies or perform repetitive tasks, there is an intrinsic value to most jobs and sectors. For instance, human resources serves an intrinsic value by uplifting the employee experience and helping an organisation bring out the best in its people. One can always choose to see the purpose and value in their jobs, especially in contributing to the larger vision of the organisation. TEDIOUS TASKS MAKE US DISENGAGE Instead, it is more likely that people do not find their jobs meaningless, but rather find some parts and tasks within their jobs pointless. For instance, an executive may see the purpose in his job but find it tedious and seemingly pointless to do tasks such as arranging logistics for a meeting or performing data entry. Such tasks could however be done away with a job review or eventually automated with the advent of technology. If unaddressed and exacerbated, however, this could contribute to the feeling of being in a pointless job. This phenomenon of pointless jobs could be a reason behind the high number of disengaged employees in Singapore. Aon Hewitt’s 2017 Trends in Global Employee Engagement Study found that Singapore, alongside Malaysia, had the lowest employee engagement rate compared to other major Asian markets. Gallup also found that up to 75 per cent of workers in Singapore indicated they were “not engaged” at work. Employees could perceive their jobs are pointless and stop seeing the value of their work, and this could in turn lead them to stop participating actively in their roles. REMOVE REDUNDANT JOBS  What then can leaders do about this? Leaders could first tackle the issue by reviewing and removing redundant jobs, and second by engaging employees to help them see the value in their work. It would be prudent to review the organisation’s needs and jobs regularly to ensure minimal redundancies and meaningful employment of staff. Leaders could also consider automating certain mundane tasks to free up employees’ time for more meaningful work. For instance, McKinsey has found that over 78 per cent of predictable, physical tasks at work can be automated. Several organisations are also embarking on digital solutions to automate manual work such as data processing and attending to customer service calls. Training employees to develop new, necessary skills and moving them to higher-value work is a key part of any strategy to remove redundant roles. The World Economic Forum’s 2016 Future of Jobs report has found that soft skills such as creativity and critical thinking will be in demand by 2025, as more manual tasks become automated. However, managerial skills will not be so easily automated, and training in such roles this could be another starting strategy. Such programmes may also signal to employees that their welfare matters and that steps are being taken to not only improve their work experience, but develop them as well. LEADERS CAN HELP STAFF GROW MOTIVATION AT WORK Leaders should also engage employees actively and help them see how their daily work contributes to the organisation’s larger vision. Often, the perception of a pointless job arises because of a lack of recognition and appreciation for an employee’s work, especially where pointless tasks cannot be done away with. Research by the Boston Research Group has found that 45 per cent of employee engagement comes intrinsically from having our needs met, identifying our role’s purpose and making full use of our individual talents. So leaders can make the sum difference in engaging their employees to help them see how their work contributes to the organisation’s goals and how their talents are utilised. Leaders could try to identify each employee’s individual motivations and their strengths. Opportunities could be created to allow employees to try areas of work that play to their strengths. These tactics may make pointless tasks more palatable. Getting employees to do work that gives them greater motivation may lead them to become more vested in their work, and translate into greater productivity and new areas of inspiration for the company. Ultimately, the issue of pointless jobs could really be an issue of perception and staff engagement. While there may be truth to the fact that there are pointless jobs that could be automated or eliminated, we find in the course of our experience that most jobs are intrinsically meaningful and the perception of “pointlessness” may really be due to certain pointless tasks within the job. These are issues leaders should tackle to ensure their employees remain committed and engaged. Dr Peter Cheng and Dr Lily Cheng are the co-founders of PACE OD Consulting, an OD consulting firm.

IoT industry suffering from security growth pains", "content": " SINGAPORE: Remember the time when StarHub’s broadband services suffered two outages, and the telco attributed them to cyberattacks on customers' compromised Web devices such as webcams and routers? Or reports that hackers are spying on us through our baby monitors and home cameras? Just this February, an Austrian cybersecurity company SEC Consult warned that the baby monitor Mi-Cam by Hong Kong-based company miSafes has vulnerabilities that would allow hackers to spy on the device including video footage. The device has more than 50,000 users.  These Internet security concerns are increasingly pushing themselves to the surface as more and more devices get connected to the Internet. And many of them are home appliances like fridges, washing machines and, yes, baby monitors that were not traditionally associated with being on the World Wide Web. For manufacturers, security is a cost, said Mr Frederic Donck, regional bureau director for Europe at Internet Society. If they do not have a compelling reason to factor it in their process - say, from regulation - then they would not, he added, shedding more light on the state of affairs. “These are guys who don’t know about security issues,” Mr Donck said in an interview. “If I’m a small company making children’s toys in China, why would I care about securing how these are connected to the Internet?” It is not just the makers of these Internet-enabled devices. More thought should also be paid to when consumers discard these appliances, Mr Donck pointed out. “What happens to that toy or device that is discarded but continues to send data?” the Internet Society executive said. “The ability to switch off (a device’s Internet connectivity) should be enabled.” Internet of Things (IoT) network operator, Unabiz, concurred, saying that security has to be addressed across the entire production cycle. “As a matter of fact, security is most times an afterthought (when) it should be by design,” it said. HACK ONE, EXPOSE ALL If we see the issue of IoT security in the context of the wider cybersecurity ecosystem, then the problem becomes more acute. Mr Francis Prince Thangasamy, vice president of IT Services and Managed Hosting for Asia Pacific at CenturyLink, said with Singapore being an important business and technology hub in the region, its systems are “ripe targets”. Mr Thangasamy said: “Enterprises, services and networks are interconnected with thousands of companies and billions of devices worldwide. A single successful cyberattack on any parts of the ecosystem will open up access to the entire network and sensitive data within and beyond the organisation or country, making it complex to manage and secure.” Additionally, the country sits in a region that botnets - networks of compromised computer systems that can be remotely controlled by hackers to conduct cyberattacks - are rife. The CenturyLink 2018 Threat Report showed that the top 5 Asia Pacific countries with bots are China, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea - with China coming in second and India tenth in the global rankings. SMART CITIES? SECURE THEM TOO This issue of securing Internet-connected devices take on an added layer of importance and urgency when you consider how governments around the world are moving towards using these to enhance urban planning and management of their cities and countries. Singapore, for example, has stated its intention to fit its streetlights with sensors that could potentially help with everything from monitoring the climate to implementing facial recognition tools to track errant motorists or flag when an accident has taken place. This project is part of its Smart Nation Sensor Platform - one of five strategic national projects underpinning its Smart Nation ambitions. Asked how the Government intends to secure these systems as they get rolled out, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) told Channel NewsAsia that agencies work closely to make sure that a device or project’s security design and architecture is resilient. Elaborating, CSA said it actively advocates a “security-by-design” motto in project implementation and this involves a three-step process. The first is to conduct threat risk assessments to identify the device or network to protect and what are the potential consequences if security is compromised. The second step is to review the system design and incorporating security considerations and requirements, while the last step is to carry out acceptance tests to make sure security measures are in place to address potential security risks. “Subscribing to security-by-design reduces piecemeal implementation and the need for costly and often ineffective retrofitting,” the agency explained. That said, CSA pointed out that there are currently no established IoT security standards. This lack of standardisation is highlighted through the responses of two well-established consumer electronics giants and their stance in securing appliances. Korean manufacturer LG, for instance, said that there are no specific guidelines, here or other markets, to securing its devices like smart TVs. It noted its smart TVs are certified by Underwriters Laboratories’ Cybersecurity Assurance Program as well as Common Criteria, an international standard for computer security. Another major player, Samsung, pointed us to its blog that stated it has incorporated its mobile security technology Knox to its other connected devices like smart TVs and signages. “Knox technology includes a hardware security system and firmware updates to ensure devices are protected,” it wrote. CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR IOT DEVICES BEING EXPLORED CSA, for its part, said Singapore “recognises that steps need to be taken” to ensure IoT products and services meet minimum standards of protection. Already, at the national level, several technical references relating to this have been published. For instance, TR64 was recently developed and published by the IT Standards Committee, under the ambit of the Singapore Standards Council, and it provides guidelines to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of large-scale IoT systems. It will also be exploring an evaluation and certification scheme to provide a security hygiene benchmark for IoT devices, the agency revealed. This was a suggestion made by Internet Society’s Mr Donck too, who said IoT manufacturers need to be more accountable and invest in security. The organisation, in its IoT security for policymakers paper published this April, recommended credible security certification schemes as a means to increase the incentives to invest in security. “Certification, by which an organisation signals that a product, service or system has passed a set of quality or performance tests, can be a powerful and visible signal of compliance to know whether an IoT device uses best practices or standards,” it said. Mr Donck suggested a certification scheme similar to what consumers see with washing machines, TVs and air-conditioners today: A visible indicator to show how water or power efficient the devices are, so consumers can make a more informed choice. At the end of the day, having a secure IoT ecosystem benefits everyone - from the parent using a baby monitor to the government looking to tap on sensor data to better manage the country. “Security is one of the key factors driving IoT adoption,” CSA said. “Without the assurance of security, Singapore will not be able to ride on the IoT wave and benefit from its far-reaching possibilities.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/my-baby-monitor-started-a-cyberattack-iot-industry-suffering-10544110"}, {"datetime": "22 Jul 2018 09:42PM", "tags": ["Changi Beach", "Singapore Civil Defence Force", "Singapore Police Force"], "author": "Nevin Jacob Thomas", "title": "Search ongoing for man last seen walking into sea off Changi Beach", "content": " SINGAPORE: The search for a man who was last seen walking into the sea off Changi Beach is ongoing, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in an update on Monday (Jul 23).

Many might not notice that it contains the character \"ą\", whereas the airline's real URL is www.qatarairways.com.  Users who enter the fake website are first shown the number of \"free tickets\" remaining, and asked to take part in a survey.  Upon answering all the questions in the survey, users are required to share the link to 15 friends/groups via WhatsApp before they are allowed to \"claim\" the \"free tickets\".  \"Any Qatar Airways Group related communication will always be sent from an official domain,\" Qatar Airways had said in its statement last month.  \"We highly recommend that you report such fraudulent attempts with details to reportfraud@qatarairways.com.qa.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/qatar-airways-free-tickets-scam-still-making-rounds-on-whatsapp-10552652"}, {"datetime": "22 Jul 2018 04:03PM", "tags": ["inequality", "data", "public policy", "analytics", "technology"], "author": "Hallam Stevens", "title": "Commentary: Many may be forgotten if data drives public policy", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore, like many other cities around the globe, has bet heavily on “big data” as a way to drive economic development and solve urban problems. Data is widely seen as a kind of resource – the oil of the 21st century – that can be mined to “unlock value and innovation” as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has put it. Data is now touted as a powerful resource that will solve problems in healthcare, transport, crime, education, and bring new economic opportunities. But such metaphors can be misleading. Data, unlike oil, is not something that is just sitting in the ground waiting to be collected.  It is mostly generated by people – when we use our smartphones, ride the MRT, visit the doctor, surf the Internet or drive our cars. Some of this data is captured by authorities including the Land Transport Authority, the Ministry of Health or other government bodies; others are sucked up by Singtel, Facebook, Google, or other private companies. But in almost all cases, data refers back to people, to us. And this means we need to be very careful how we use and interpret it. Data may not lie, but – like the people it comes from – it can be messy, incomplete and misleading. MISINTERPRETED, MISUSED DATA  In the United States, for example, crime data is increasingly used to direct police to particular neighbourhoods. Famed American mathematician Cathy O’Neil has recently written about how sophisticated software such as Predpol and Hunchlab analyse crime statistics. In Santa Cruz, California, for example, Predpol examined eleven years of data of past crimes to generate predictions about where future crimes may occur. These “hotspots” appear as red squares on a map on a computer screen. More police can now be sent to these areas. So far, so good. But having a greater police presence in an area also means more crimes may be detected, especially petty crimes. These are then fed back into the software, making an area look even more dangerous and attracting an even greater police presence. The result is that some neighborhoods end up with many more arrests and many more people being sent to jail. This is exactly what has happened in cities across the US including Philadelphia, Chicago and New York. That’s not fair, and it’s also not a smart use of data – it amplifies inequalities between groups. This could happen in Singapore too. One of the uses of big data here has been the use of locational information from our phones, collected by telcos in Singapore. Patterns of foot traffic can be mined to find the most heavily walked areas within malls and shopping streets. This is used by retail brands to find the ideal location for their next outlet or by malls to set rental prices. But this kind of reasoning may contribute to a vicious cycle in which depressed areas remain depressed, while rich areas get richer. DATA CAN EXACERBATE INEQUALITY  Directing business to high-traffic neighbourhoods means that those areas will retain good jobs; this means less money and less spending in low-traffic neighbourhoods, potentially leading to even less economic activity.  The use of data may exacerbate the differences between the best-served and worst-served areas. For now this remains a hypothetical in Singapore, but elsewhere in the world the results of big data approaches are already becoming clear. For example, US activist Virginia Eubanks has recently exposed how data-driven systems – such as the Homeless Management Information System in Los Angeles and the predictive risk modelling Allegheny Family Screening Tool in Pennsylvania – are trapping vulnerable individuals in cycles of poverty and homelessness. If we begin to allocate public services – such as healthcare, education, public transportation – according to data, we need to make sure we’re interpreting it correctly. Recent news has highlighted the growing significance of big data in the healthcare sector. One report described how Fullerton Healthcare had examined data from medical transactions at public hospitals in Singapore, searching for spikes in reported cases of chronic conditions such as diabetes in particular areas. When they found an uptick, the company tried to help areas in need by delivering health education and awareness campaigns about diet and healthy eating. In some areas, the number of medical claims dropped substantially. But this data only captures those individuals who attended hospitals or clinics; it does not measure the actual occurrences of chronic disease. Those who are the most vulnerable may be left out of these statistics  - maybe because they find it difficult to travel to a doctor, or are worried about the costs of medical care. Certainly the reduced number of claims is saving Fullerton money, but is it really serving the public interest? One solution is to make data as open as possible – to let everyone see and use them. The Government’s data.gov.sg website aims to give Singaporeans access to large quantities of public data they can examine for themselves. A quick glance at the portal reveals information about crime, housing, education, the economy, transport, health and many other areas. This is surely a good thing because we need as many people as possible to be aware of what data exists and participate in analysis. But opening up data does not solve every problem. We also need to know and take into account where and how data is collected and who it is collected from. If data is collected from web and smartphone users, for example, we can’t expect it to fairly represent the elderly population who are likely to use such technologies less. If data is collected from public transport, we can’t expect it to evenly reflect the whole socio-economic spectrum of Singapore, since wealthier individuals are more likely to drive, nor can we necessarily expect data to equally represent races, religions, or language groups. Of course, all this doesn’t mean we should abandon big data. But data requires great care in its interpretation. Data is not inherently smart and won’t automatically lead to the best solutions to social or economic problems. We need to temper the enthusiasm for data with continued awareness of its limitations. This means keeping an eye on who data represents, who it includes, and who it leaves out. That's the really smart thing to do.   Hallam Stevens is a historian whose work focuses on understanding the social, political and economic impact of new and emerging technologies.

The victims that Channel NewsAsia spoke to said the charges were deducted from their accounts at DBS and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC). Two people told Channel NewsAsia that they lost at least S$7,000 each to iTunes purchases with one saying she was billed on her HSBC credit card. She added that she only realised something was amiss when she received a text message from HSBC that she had less than 30 per cent of her credit limit left. She realised the extent of the issue after speaking to a customer service operator. At OCBC alone, there were 58 cases of fraudulent transactions in July, the bank told Channel NewsAsia. “In early July, we detected and investigated unusual transactions on 58 cardholders’ accounts. Upon confirmation that these were fraudulent transactions, we deployed the necessary counter-measures and are currently assisting the affected cardholders via the chargeback process,\" said Mr Vincent Tan, head of credit cards at OCBC Bank. UOB increased its monitoring of iTunes transactions last week, the bank told Channel NewsAsia on Sunday.  \"Where our system detected a potentially fraudulent transaction, we immediately called our customer to check with them on the transaction,\" said UOB, adding that it would help a customer claim a refund once the fraudulent transaction is confirmed. A new card would also be issued as an additional security measure.  For customers it is unable to reach, UOB said it would send an SMS notification. It would also block their bank accounts temporarily to prevent further potential misuse.  ​​​​​​​AMOUNT OF EACH UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTION WAS S$112.03 One of the victims is 28-year-old Deepan Chakkaravarthi, who discovered last week that nearly S$700 had been drained from his account at DBS. Shocked that his \"account balance had been completely wiped out\", Mr Deepan called DBS and was told that six iTunes transactions had been made. He did not authorise any of those six iTunes transactions, Mr Deepan told Channel NewsAsia. The purchases - each for S$112.03 - were made by another iCloud account holder, who had used his account, Mr Deepan added. \"A senior advisor I spoke with (at Apple Singapore) told me that information. But they (have since) suspended that account,\" Mr Deepan said. Apple Singapore has since nullified the purchases and DBS has given him a temporary credit for the disputed transactions, said Mr Deepan. In response to queries, Apple Singapore told Channel NewsAsia that they are looking into the matter. The company also highlighted their support page, which provides an avenue for customers to report any problems with purchases made on iTunes.  \"They will need to sign in using their Apple ID, and will then be able to view purchases and assess veracity before reporting the issue,\" Apple Singapore said.   Engineer Myo Aung Tun, 44, too had multiple S$112.03 unauthorised iTunes transactions deducted from his POSB savings account on Jul 14. The total charges that were racked up came up to nearly S$450. He told Channel NewsAsia that the money was returned to him on Jul 19.  \"I called the bank and they instructed (me) to change to a new card,\" he said.  CHARGES ON PHONE BILLS TOO Gabriel Lim, who was billed S$200 earlier this year for iTunes purchases he did not make, received the charges on his mobile phone bill. Multiple \"iTunes Orders\" were charged to his M1 phone bill between April and May, Lim said. He then contacted Apple Singapore to cancel the transactions. Another batch of \"iTunes Orders\" were charged again in June and July. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/apple-fraudulent-itunes-charges-dozens-of-cases-singapore-10551110"}, {"datetime": "22 Jul 2018 06:22AM", "tags": ["football", "ben davis", "singapore"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'The start of hard work to come': What signing a professional contract could mean for Ben Davis", "content": " SINGAPORE: Penning a professional contract with a Premier League club is a massive achievement, English footballers past and present told Channel NewsAsia, but making the step up to the first team presents a big challenge for youngsters like Benjamin Davis. Having joined Fulham on a scholarship in July last year, it was announced last Friday (Jul 13) that the 17-year-old midfielder had signed a two-year professional contract with the Cottagers. Davis is the first Singaporean to ink a professional contract with a club in the top flight of English football. For a young player to do so represents a milestone, said former Premier League midfielder Gary Taylor-Fletcher. \"You've worked so hard to get to the point of having a chance and the actual number of footballers (in all of England) who get that first professional contract is minute,\" the former Blackpool and Leicester City man explained. \"It's a massive achievement, but it's only the start of the hard work to come.\" \"It's fantastic, when you've signed a professional contract - it's the best feeling in your life,\" agreed former goalkeeper John Burridge, who clocked almost 800 appearances for over 25 clubs in the United Kingdom. \"But you still haven't made it yet.\" Players at top tier English academies have a better chance of being offered a professional contract than those at the lower rungs, according to a 2017 Guardian article citing statistics from the Premier League. Fulham are one of 15 Premier League and nine Championship clubs in that top tier, where 65 per cent of their 18-year-olds got offered such contracts last year. But signing a professional contract is just the beginning. From then on, they will get to train either with the first team, U-23s or U-18s, depending on how good they are. \"It all depends on the coaches and how they see the player developing,\" said Taylor-Fletcher, who signed his first professional contract with Leyton Orient.  \"If he's someone who is a big lad and who has developed well, then he might be put straight in with the U-23s. But usually at that age, they'll have a year or two with the U-18s before they make the step up.\" \"To get into the first team, that's an even bigger step up again,\" added Taylor-Fletcher. \"At 18 you sign a contract, you might not play in the first team till you're 21 or 22.\" Such was the case for Crewe Alexandra defender Perry Ng, a 22-year-old Englishman who qualifies to play for Singapore as his paternal grandfather is Singaporean. After signing his first professional contract at 18, Ng took close to two years to make his first start for Crewe. \"It was very difficult at first because I was a young pro and wasn’t getting selected so I had to work hard and try to impress in training,\" he said.  \"Most got released at the end of their contract and now play for semi-pro teams, or some went to university.\" As for Ng, he had to drop to the lower divisions to get more game time, towards the end of his first season as a professional.  \"This was good for me as I got to play men's football for the first time and show Crewe that they could trust me playing against men,\" he added. Ng is currently a mainstay with the League Two side, but he stressed that it is tough for young players to make the leap to the first team. \"Most other clubs don’t really give young lads a chance unless they are an exceptional talent,\" he said. \"So I owe a lot to Crewe for giving me the chance at such a young age as many other young lads don’t even get a chance.\" One such talent that Davis could seek inspiration from is Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon, who joined the Cottagers' academy at the age of eight, making his first start for the club in 2016 at the age of 16. Similar to Davis, Sessegnon was also on a scholarship contract before turning professional. But while the Singaporean has mostly been featuring for the U-18s, Sessegnon played for the first team while he was on scholarship, scoring seven goals in 30 appearances in the 2016-2017 season. After signing a professional contract, the 18-year-old last season became the first player from outside the top flight to be shortlisted for the Professional Footballers’ Association Young Player of the Year award. But the speedy Sessegnon, who plays as a left back or left winger, is the exception rather than the norm. The latest CIES Football Observatory report found that in the English top flight, of the players who spent at least three years between the ages of 15 and 21 at their clubs, only one in 10 graduated from their academies.  \"At some of the top Premier League clubs now, it is very difficult to get the youngsters through,\" said Taylor-Fletcher, who has moved into management after a long playing career. \"With the amount of money in the game and the pressure on managers to succeed, they will often go out and buy somebody ready made, rather than developing someone.\" However, the door remains open for Davis to make his first start in one of the world's top leagues. Premier League rules state that each club can use an unlimited number of U-21 players throughout the season, on top of their 25-man squad. At the start of the 2017/18 Premier League season, there were an average of 49 players in each club registered as U-21 players, including those signed on contracts and scholars. A number of these players went on to feature in their respective clubs' campaigns, such as Arsenal's Alex Iwobi, Chelsea's Andreas Christensen and Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold. Davis could be registered as a U-21 player for Fulham in the upcoming season, but whether he will make his Premier League bow remains to be seen. \"He needs to stay focused, train hard and dedicate himself (to football), said Burridge, a former goalkeeping coach with Singapore.  \"Everybody's got a different mentality, some people will strive and progress with a winning mentality,\" added Taylor-Fletcher. \"It all depends on the personality of the individual, and on the coaches at the U-18 and U-23 squads.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/the-start-of-hard-work-to-come-what-signing-a-professional-10544746"}, {"datetime": "22 Jul 2018 06:21AM", "tags": ["housing", "Singapore property", "ABSD", "en bloc", "property"], "author": "Sing Tien Foo", "title": "Commentary: Did the Government intervene too early in Singapore’s private housing market? ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Days after the release of Urban Redevelopment Authority’s flash estimates, the Government announced a new round of cooling measures, which caught many in the housing market by surprise. Authorities might have been right in principle to impose these harsh cooling measures, amidst a private property market heating up. The private housing market experienced an inflexion in prices last year after 15 consecutive quarters of decline since fourth quarter of 2013. In contrast to the gradual recovery in 2017, 2018 has seen a strong price growth momentum. Private property prices increased by 9.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2018. Compared to the cumulative run-up of 62.2 per cent in private property prices from the second quarter of 2009 to the peak in 2013, this increase does not seem alarming. However, it should be noted that prices in 2017 rebounded from a relatively high base. Housing price levels are also just 3 per cent short of the 2013 peak. Transaction volume also picked up as developers ramped up en bloc sales to quell pent-up demand. But the timing and intensity of the latest interventions have been met with raised eyebrows. One analyst likens it to using “a sledgehammer to kill a fly”. The Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore describes the Government’s move as “tough” and “harsh”. Real estate developers also assess that since the market has only started to show signs of improvement, there is no basis for the Government to intervene at such an early stage. To be fair, the Government’s interventions do not come without warning. A large volume of en bloc sales has been completed at record-breaking prices in 2016 and 2017, with S$8.8 billion worth of transactions reported in the first half of this year. These en bloc sites could be redeveloped into approximately 20,000 new private homes, doubling the number of new units in the next two years, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This has led to the Government’s increasing concerns about rising vacancy rates. If demand is not robust enough to match a bumper supply, there may be massive downward pressure on housing prices and rental. INVESTORS WILL FEEL THE HEAT, ESPECIALLY FOREIGNERS How will the recent round of cooling measures, coupled with the earlier revision to the Buyer’s Stamp Duty (BSD), add to the costs of private housing purchases in Singapore? First-time Singaporean buyers are only affected by the additional 1 per cent BSD, if they buy a private house of above S$1 million. Assuming a second private condominium of S$1.5 million purchased for investment purposes after the July 2018 round of changes to the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD), Singapore citizens would have to pay S$180,000 in ABSD. This figure is S$225,000 and S$300,000 for Permanent Residents (PRs) and foreigners respectively. Coupled with valuation, legal fees and minimum downpayments, a Singaporean buyer is expected to fork out about S$600,000 at the outset. The figure is approximately S$650,000 for PRs and S$720,000 for foreigners – a huge proportion of the purchase price. For a smaller second condominium of S$1 million, Singaporean citizens will have to fork out an upfront payment amounting to S$397,600. For a S$2 million house, this figure amounts to slightly more than S$800,000. WILL THEY DETER WEALTHY PROPERTY OWNERS? If it sounds like a lot, we should keep in mind that many existing measures have not deterred a huge number of wealthy property owners.  The Ministry of National Development (MND) revealed in February that a total of 20,000 homeowners in Singapore own between three to 10 private residential properties in Singapore, with 15 per cent of them also owning a HDB flat.  These new ABSD measures will force these property buyers to re-evaluate whether buying second or more properties is still a feasible investment option in land-scarce Singapore.  Singapore citizens would need their second investment property price to appreciate by approximately 15 per cent, just to recover the ABSD and BSD. This figure is 23 per cent for foreigners. There are other Asian cities which have already surpassed our current stamp duty rates. Foreigners looking to buy their second property in Hong Kong, for example, face a whopping 30 per cent in upfront stamp duties. On top of this, Hong Kong is proposing a vacancy tax at 200 per cent of a newly built unit’s estimated annual rental value to discourage market speculators from buying and holding onto properties while waiting for their values to rise. The immediate effects have been adverse. The sudden announcement of the new ABSD and loan-to-value ratio rules have triggered knee-jerk reactions from buyers, who flocked to showflats to place their option to purchase. More than 1,000 units of private condominiums were snatched up by panic buyers before the midnight deadline. Shares of property developers and real estate agencies reacted most instantaneously in the first days of the new rules. Share prices dropped with some hitting record lows. TWO SCENARIOS The Government’s actions come at a time when it is necessary to keep housing affordability in check. The new cooling measures are expected to adversely affect purchasing activities by investors and speculators in the private housing markets. If those who are not willing to pay the additional ABSD choose to stay on the sidelines, the market could enter into a cooling period with little sale activities. In a pessimistic scenario where the demand is dampened, developers may have to revise their prices to move sales. Developers who plan to acquire new en bloc sites, and have properties in their portfolio – yet to be launched for sale – will suffer a double whammy. On top of the extra 5 per cent they will have to pay for acquiring the private residential projects, they may also face a dwindling pool of potential buyers in upcoming launches. Developers may be hoping for an optimistic scenario in which unconstrained, undeterred buyers, including foreign investors, continue to bet on the long-term prospects of private residential properties in Singapore. KEEPING HOUSING MARKET STABLE At first glance, the Government’s measures today may have muted the steady progress of the real estate market in the short-run. Upon closer scrutiny, it may be more prudent to see them as preventive measures imposed ahead of time to prevent the property market from overheating, with adverse consequences for the economy. With the rapid buying and selling of private properties, the en bloc frenzy and residential land sales, the last to suffer in the speculative foray will be individuals who over-commit and stretch beyond their means. The Government is obligated to act quickly to protect these individuals from being overly exposed to the risks in an overzealous market. Such measures may ensure that in the long-run, Singapore continues to enjoy a stable and sustainable property market.

You would hardly notice her in a crowd, much less realise that she is a co-founder and CEO (Singapore) of ezbuy, a successful e-commerce platform. In 2010, she and three friends decided to make their foray into the then-nascent e-commerce industry and started ezbuy, which they now describe as Singapore's largest global online shopping platform and leader in cross-border e-commerce in Southeast Asia. In 2016, ezbuy.sg was the 9th top search term in Singapore according to Google’s Year in Search ranking. The platform allows consumers to shop for items directly from online stores out of China, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US. Singapore consumers enjoy access to millions of products worldwide while paying “the least in itemised costs”. In May this year, it raised US$17.6 million in its latest round of funding, which it intends to use to \"offer quicker and more reliable modes of localised services\". But for all her business success, Ms Liu, who is originally from China, seems very nervous during our interview. At first, she hesitates to answer even the most straightforward questions such as why and how she ended up in Singapore. After some cajoling, she reveals that she came here at the age of 17 to further her studies at her mother’s insistence. To listen to the full interview, click here. “I was quite a little princess at home. In China, every family has only one child. My mother just felt that I was quite dependent. My mum works in government and her job is related to the education system. She just felt that maybe an overseas educational system was more advanced. She also hoped that I could be more independent. She hoped that I can explore more things outside of China.” Now a Singapore citizen, she holds a Master’s degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering from the National University of Singapore and is a First-class Honours graduate in Electrical & Electronics Engineering with a minor in Business from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).  When she says that she has learnt a lot and gained more than she can expect from studying and working independently in Singapore, I ask what precisely she has learnt.  But this question is met with hesitation and nervous laughter. We soldier on despite the difficulties. To be fair, at certain points, she does come across as a confident businesswoman. At one point she declares, “I think in the near future, we are going to be the only profitable e-commerce platform in this region.” But when I ask why she is so confident, I am again met by a pause and a heavy sigh, before she says, “I can’t really share.” I wonder why she would make such a statement but then decline to elaborate. She then answers the question. “We have now expanded to countries outside of ASEAN region. That is why we need this latest round of funding. And with expansion in other countries, we are able to work towards breaking even.” THE PUBLIC SPAT WITH TAOBAO One thing is for sure. ezbuy’s public spat late last year with Chinese e-marketplace giant Taobao and its owner Alibaba still makes her uncomfortable. Her company was forced to stop offering some of its services after more than 1,000 of its accounts were blocked by Taobao. Alibaba had said that ezbuy’s practice of creating accounts to buy items from Taobao and reselling them was an act of scalping. At the time, ezbuy had said that they were “simply giving customers a more curated selection of products”. That was how their “China Buy-For-Me” service was positioned from the start. When I ask Ms Liu about whether there have been any developments on this front today, she is visibly agitated and seems unwilling to address it. Eventually she says there have been “no further developments” on that front. “I’ve no further comments on that. But, to be very honest, for the past eight months, we’ve been working even harder to bring more and more sellers to join us and sell directly to customers. You know in China, there are millions of sellers. Those sellers are our working partners. There are also others from other parts of the world who are already on our platform. So, we are trying our best to get more sellers to join ezbuy and help them to sell to local consumers directly.” Thankfully, she grows more confident as the conversation progresses. It was two years ago that ezbuy was rebranded from a third-party proxy platform to a direct marketplace which she says has “really made the huge difference”. When I ask her about Alibaba’s allegations of “scalping”, she categorically denies it. “What does scalping mean? It means you buy something at cheaper cost and sell at higher cost. But that’s not what we were doing. For example, the shipping fee we can offer to consumers is the lowest in the industry and the consumer is not paying higher. Scalping literally means that you gain huge profits from selling certain things. But we are not gaining huge profits. Otherwise we wouldn’t need our venture capitalists to invest in us.” WILL PRICES INCREASE AFTER MARKET SHARE IS ACHIEVED? Indeed at this point, she says ezbuy is not profitable even after 8 years, but she expects to achieve profitability “soon”. She admits that the focus for the past eight years has been market share. I wonder though whether once they achieve market share, their prices to sellers and buyers would increase. I bring up how the recent Grab-Uber merger led to consumers complaining about fewer promotional rides and higher prices overall on the Grab platform. Could e-commerce go that way too? She assures me that this is not their plan. “Once you get enough market share, you are able to get some profit because you have the economies of scale, you are able to manage your costs, you are able to help your sellers to have more efficiencies so that they can sell things cheaper to your customers,” she says.  “Competition is very important. You need to have more players in this industry in order to maintain competitiveness to offer consumers a better price. Mergers and acquisitions may work against that. The Government must make sure that there is fair competition in this industry and we should not tolerate a monopoly in any of the industries because then, consumers will suffer.” At this point, one way they keep their costs down is by consolidating deliveries in order to manage transportation fees. They also made a deliberate attempt early on to take control of the delivery process. “In 2010, when we first started, if you wanted to do a night delivery or delivery over the weekend, local logistics companies would charge us maybe about S$30 to S$40. So in the end, we decided, why not do this ourselves.” Like some other logistics companies, they’ve also introduced hundreds of collection points for customers to pick up their parcels on their own, thereby reducing costs further. STARTING UP WHEN NO ONE ELSE HAD She remembers a time when she had to deliver parcels to customers on her own and how underdeveloped the local market was. “When my friends and I started this business we had to do everything on our own. There wasn’t even an online credit card payment system in Singapore. We had to accept bank transfers. When we first started in 2010, customers needed to go to a desktop computer to shop online. It was in 2012 that we introduced our first shopping app in Singapore.” She admits that starting such a business in such a market was risky, but says that she and her team were determined to make it work. “Every decision has a risk factor. It’s all about how you are going to manage your risk and it’s about your determination, whether you want to be successful or not. I think in a country where e-commerce had not taken off, it really gave us a first-mover advantage. We were quite lucky that when we started in Singapore in 2010. There was no other player in the market and that helped us to actually accumulate a group of customers who are really tech-savvy and have a huge influencing power.” Another reason for their success is that the retail scene here was “really not evolving”, she says. “Things were still expensive and everything was imported from overseas, so it wasn’t difficult to come up with a unique selling proposition.” Ms Liu’s drive to become an entrepreneur started in her university days. “Since young, I was very good at subjects like mathematics, data and other computing-related subjects, so it was quite natural for me to choose engineering as my field of choice. I feel that engineers make significant and impactful changes for our society, leveraging on technology to re-shape our lifestyles.” But while her fellow schoolmates stuck to the minimum core curriculum, she decided to pick up additional business-related modules. She did this largely out of curiosity, but they ended paving the way for her career. On a visit to China later, she realised the virtually unlimited product varieties on offer and decided to design a concept to allow customers from Singapore to shop globally with savings to boot. BEING RESPONSIBLE Singapore, she says, is one of the best places in the world to start a business. “I feel that the Singapore Government is really a very friendly government. There are so many policies to help startups. You just need to go online and apply, or ask some agency to help you and then you are able to open a business. In other countries, it could take weeks.” Starting might be easy, but survival is quite a different matter. “Our business model helps. We didn’t really need to pay upfront rental to run the business. We just needed a web site. But nothing is without a challenge. It may be competitive in Singapore, but the competition overseas is even more intense.” While startups are all the rage in a range of industries – from e-retail to transportation – she acknowledges that recent experiences may have left a bad taste in customers’ mouths. Referring to bike-sharing company, oBike’s sudden closure in Singapore recently, she says it’s an example of what not to do. “I really think it was not responsible of them to do this. You have the trust from customers. You need to be responsible for everything. We are a local startup and our customers are largely Singaporeans. I think that really helped us to instill a trust factor in consumers’ minds.” However, the e-commerce landscape will soon change. We discuss a Goods and Services Tax (GST) that will be pegged to imported e-commerce services in 2020. The GST will apply to overseas suppliers without an establishment here and will cover digital business-to-business services including marketing and IT services, as well as business-to-consumer services such as video and music streaming, apps and listing fees on electronic marketplaces. E-commerce tax for goods that cost less than $400 will not be affected for now. Ms Liu does not see the tax as a problem. “I think it’s fair enough because in retail, customers are paying GST, so why not on e-commerce. I think it’s a fair decision as long as every platform is taxed equally. Fair play is very important in every industry.” ARE BRICK-AND-MORTAR BUSINESSES DOOMED? Considering the growth of e-commerce, I wonder if she thinks brick-and-mortar retail will soon be dead. “E-commerce is developing, but if we look at the retail space in, for example, China right now, everyone is talking about 'new retail'. It’s all about how you are going to connect online retail to offline retail.  We’re thinking about how we can help more offline retailers sell online and at the same time, how we can encourage consumers to go to retail stores to have a better experience. \"One way is to let customers for example, try on clothes in the store, but not waste time queuing up to make payments in the store. Let them make payments online and get their clothes delivered to their doorstep the next day.\" Traditional retailers have to be “more open about innovating with online stores”.   Online stores “are not the enemy”, she says. With technology such as Virtual Reality being developed to enhance the retail experience, she feels the sector is going to become even more vibrant.  THE IMPORTANCE OF HUNGER But in order to succeed in any sector, she believes that Singaporeans need to be more “hungry”. “Compared to people in the States and China, we are not that hungry. The government brings a sense of security to the population here. This is good, but also bad. This is why a lot of people don’t feel any threat of competition. However, the world is evolving so fast. We have to stand out. “Nowadays, schools offer more interdisciplinary subjects to help students to explore different kinds of fields. University students and even adults are able to take up courses like virtual reality and blockchain technology. I think it’s all about how we can stay hungry and have the eagerness to learn new things.” While today, Ms Liu seems rooted in Singapore, I wonder if she would consider going back to China. \"No, I love this country. During the best of my past 10 years, I’ve been here and I have seen a lot changes and I have been part of the changes. So this is something that I will never forget.” She believes that if she had stayed in China, she may not have had the opportunity to be part of the industry. “I was studying electronics engineering at NTU in Singapore and opposite my campus was Nanyang Business School. It was because of that that I made the decision to take a minor in business. I believe if I went to one of the universities in China, I wouldn’t have been able to do that. There wasn’t such set-up for students to explore when I was there.” She currently sees her business as a way to “contribute to customers’ lives”. She acknowledges that they receive bad reviews, which she tries to “investigate personally”, but she also makes it a point to spend time reading the positive reviews. Ultimately, it comes down to the little things. “Positive reviews energise and motivate me. On our 5th anniversary, we had an event and invited a lot of customers to join us. Some who couldn’t show up sent me personal e-mails. Some said they had been shopping with us from the time they were in school, through to the time they got married and bought their first home and had to buy furniture for renovations.  \"When I read these, I felt like my efforts have been worthwhile.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wendy-liu-ceo-founder-ezbuy-on-the-record-10548762"}, {"datetime": "22 Jul 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["ageing", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Ruth Smalley", "title": "Defying frailty: How a 67-year-old is training to walk again", "content": " SINGAPORE: It began with a knee replacement operation in 2012. Then another, two years later. The third blow came in 2016: Spinal surgery. His legs, which once used to carry him long distances on the football pitch in his favourite position as a midfielder, became spindly, and walking became painful. So 67-year-old Jack Liew turned to a personal mobility device to get about. He would still go to the library almost daily, and return with travel books and documentaries. But they showed him places in the same way as lifting the cover of a birdcage would show its fluttering inhabitant a freedom it cannot have. Feeling helpless and dependent on his mechanical chair was not how he had imagined his sunset years. “My idea (of retirement) was that I could travel the world. Now I can’t do it any more,” lamented Mr Liew, who once used to go on walking tours to scenic wonders like the Grand Canyon. Just a trip outside his home could get him feeling “depressed and lonely”. “Mainly when I see other people doing physical (activities) like running and walking, you know?” he said. “I used to be able to do all these.” His world felt even lonelier because his wife and son were working, while he had quit his job as a computer engineer owing to his lack of mobility. Afternoons were spent waiting for them to return home. Yet despite slowly slipping into isolation, Mr Liew refused to accept the notion that old age was an inevitable process of decay. In the two years since doctors told him that he may never be able to walk normally again, he had not lost hope of getting back on his feet. He just needed to find a way to do it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n FIGHTING FRAILTY IN OLD AGE Mr Liew’s situation highlights a growing concern about frailty in Singapore’s ageing population. It worries caregivers like Ms M L Tan, whose mother S Y Chin, 83, suffered a fall two years ago, about the same time she was diagnosed with dementia. “When you look at your parents (last time), they were independent. But after one or two falls, things change suddenly,” said Ms Tan. Mdm Chin's physiotherapy sessions lasted for about a year. But afterwards, she became susceptible to falls again. Concerned that she would deteriorate further, her daughter sought other options. Similarly, Mr Liew, who was using a walking frame at home, recently began feeling a sense of desperation about his physical decline, he shared. I was fearful that one day I’ll be bedridden. That’s my innermost fear. Then one day, he saw an advertisement for Gym Tonic, a programme started in 2015 by the Lien Foundation that is focused on helping folks aged 55 or older to regain their physical strength - and in doing so, to extend their independence and functional years. The foundation’s programme director Gabriel Lim said: “With Gym Tonic, we’re trying to address the problem of frailty in the community (and) muscle loss that is typical of ageing.” It is available to seniors at more than 20 eldercare facilities across Singapore.  Participants are assessed before they embark on a three-month fitness journey with a coach, and they must set themselves a goal to achieve at the final assessment. In this way, the training is tailored to his or her own needs. Mr Liew was “very excited” when he registered for the programme. He knew what his goal would be: To walk again, with just a cane.  NO MIRACLE CURE, BUT STILL A TONIC The goals are not so dramatic for many of Gym Tonic’s seniors. But improvements can be seen in the little things in their daily life. One participant, 72-year-old ex-nanny Lim Moi Eng, enrolled in the programme complaining of back pains and having to use heat patches “to soothe the area”. Since then, with the help of the exercise machines, she has improved her back strength. “Now I don’t need the heat patches,” she said with a laugh. There is, however, no miracle cure. “We don’t claim that their leg pain or shoulder pain will get better. We tell them that by doing this, they’ll become stronger,” Gym Tonic wellness coach Looi Yuan Hui said. And if they experience excessive pain, “we encourage them to visit a doctor”. Mr Looi, a former national wrestler who suffered a career-ending knee injury, can empathise with the elderly. I tend to joke with them, saying that I have one knee that’s 30 years old and another that’s 60 – so I know how it feels when there’s a knee pain. “They’ve probably been through a dark period in their lives. They just need people to cheer them up at times.” Indeed, Mdm Chin's daughter observed that her mother has become more mentally alert since joining Gym Tonic. “You can see it in her eyes,” Ms Tan said, adding that she even seems to enjoy the banter with her wellness coaches. As for Mr Liew, daughter Shawna described him as having been \"quite down ever since his surgery\", and felt that having a goal to work towards would be good for him.  But she was privately doubtful he could go back to his old \"go anywhere he wanted\" mobile lifestyle. “It doesn’t look as if he’s going to get there,” she sighed.  “I don’t want to discourage him. But at the same time, you don’t want to over-expect.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SLOW AND STEADY PROGRESS Mr Liew’s knees had been giving him trouble long before his surgeries. The same goes for his back, which he sprained carrying heavy computer equipment as a young technician. But he did not seek medical attention until it was too late. “That’s one thing I didn’t do,” he said, rubbing his scarred and knobbly knees. It is one of his main regrets. After he started going to his twice-weekly Gym Tonic classes at Bishan Community Club in April, the leg press machine soon became his professed nemesis. When CNA Insider visited him four weeks into his training, he was pushing a 12.5-kilogramme load on the machine – 1.5 kg heavier than the first time he tried it. He focused with the effort. “This is the real thing,” he said in between breaths. WATCH: His 12-week journey of ups and downs (12:29)  He made his way diligently from machine to machine, rejecting advice from his wellness coach Joseph Chan to take breaks. There was a glint of determination in his eyes, as he cleared his mind of everything but the task in front of him. “I just concentrate on myself and my breathing,” Mr Liew said.  This hard work paid off in week nine, when he was able to stand unassisted for 45 seconds, with his legs hip-width apart - surprising even his coach. “Previously you weren’t able to stand for even one second, right Jack?” Mr Chan, 30, said encouragingly. THE SETBACK It was not all plain sailing for Mr Liew, however. In the 10th week, just two weeks shy of achieving his goal, he lost his balance while getting out of bed and sprained his ankle. Such falls in the past had been like body blows to his will to walk again, and this time was no different. “My first thought was, ‘oh no, I did it again',” he said, visibly downcast in a vlog he kept for CNA Insider. His injury meant he had to lay off the leg press machine and focus more on working out his upper limbs. Mr Chan said such setbacks were \"common for the elderly\", and sometimes, this might cause a client to quit the programme entirely.  Or, as in Mr Liew's case, put a dent in their optimism. He wasn't his usual self as he moved at a snail’s pace, head bowed, gaze fixed on the black-and-blue sole of his swollen left foot. “I think I have to resign myself to fate,” a dispirited Mr Liew said haltingly.  \"I don’t think I can ever walk normally again… (but) I’m still trying.” REUNITED, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD In the past, Mr Liew could rouse himself from the dark moments through music. He'd gigged with various bands since he was 14, and played in places like Clarke Quay and Chijmes. Some of his happiest memories were of playing the bass guitar with his band Criteria, formed in the 1990s by members he had met during a Yamaha music course he was taking. “Music is my first love,” he said. “Playing in a band … you’d keep your mind off whatever you’re depressed with – at least you feel happy.” But his hands that could pluck a guitar effortlessly had become gnarled, unable to play riffs as before. He found some consolation in playing the harmonica and the ukulele as a solo act at home. Since he'd become reliant on his personal mobility device, he'd missed jamming with his band - yet another “depressing part” of his life, he said. Which is why, to lift his spirits after his recent setback, CNA Insider arranged for Criteria to reunite for a jam session at a studio. And he did seem to forget about his swollen foot as he whipped out a bass ukulele he had bought online recently. “It’s easier to pluck. I can still play with this,” Mr Liew told his bandmates, tuning it excitedly. As they launched into several numbers, starting with 60s pop classics from The Beatles and Ben E King. he struggled to keep up. But his enthusiasm did not waver. “Let’s do another one,” he said after every song. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He was especially happy to play Stand By Me, his favourite song. “Because of the lyrics,” he explained. “We’re always a band, and a band always stand by each other.” The band have decided to get back to jamming together regularly soon. BABY STEPS More than just a happy blast from the past, the session helped put Mr Liew in a forward-looking frame of mind again. “Even if you have a disability, try and live your life,” he said. It was this positivity that he summoned for D-day at Gym Tonic on July 7 – when he had to try walking with a cane. His coach had postponed the assessment for two weeks to give his ankle time to recover. Giving him an added boost was the presence of his daughter and grandson Linus. Starting with questions about how active he'd been for example, the assessment proceeded to a series of muscle tests and a balancing test. Then came the moment everyone was waiting for. As he took up his position with his cane, Mr Chan instructed him: “Stand up tall for me first.” Taking a deep breath, Mr Liew began to take his first steps, as his coach held his other hand and clutched him from the back for support. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Brow furrowed, he moved slowly for a few metres – and for 27 seconds – before sitting down to catch his breath. His face relaxed, and then he smiled. “Wow! That’s the first time (in two years) I’ve walked with a cane,” he said. Happy and surprised at the “vast improvement” she saw, his daughter hoped he would continue to persevere. Mr Chan urged him likewise - though Mr Liew himself seemed to need no prompting. “It’s a good starting point, but I wouldn’t say I’ve reached my goal yet,\" said the pleased grandfather, who plans to continue his strength training for another three months. \"There are good signs that I can get better.\" “Who knows, maybe I’ll be walking (with a cane) the next time you see me.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/defying-frailty-ageing-elderly-gym-tonic-strength-training-10545386"}, {"datetime": "21 Jul 2018 11:06PM", "tags": ["economy", "property", "cooling measures", "ABSD"], "author": "Wendy Wong", "title": "Private housing market unlikely to head into oversupply situation: Analysts", "content": " SINGAPORE: About 3,000 visitors flocked to the opening day preview for private project The Tre Ver in Potong Pasir on Saturday (Jul 21), just two weeks after higher stamp duties and tighter loan limits were introduced. Units at the 729-unit condominium, which will be completed in 2022, are priced from around S$1,400 psf. But even with the tighter loan-to-value limits, homebuyers Channel NewsAsia spoke to were not deterred. Interested homebuyer Eric Kon said that he thought the pricing was \"reasonable\" and \"worth it to buy\". Another homebuyer said that despite the cooling measures, she would still go ahead to buy a property, after selling off her current home. The 201,405-sq-ft project is just a stone's throw away from Park Colonial's showroom, where buyers have snapped up half of the units available since Jul 5, when the surprise cooling measures were announced. Channel NewsAsia understands that Park Colonial closed its showflat on Jul 15 to \"reconsolidate\". Such sentiments go against the gloomy outlook from the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS), whose president Augustine Tan has warned that the cooling measures could worsen the oversupply of private residential units. According to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority and JLL Singapore, an estimated 50,526 unsold private units are projected to come on stream in the coming years, including projects that have and have not been granted planning approvals, as well as all Government Land Sales and collective sales sites sold up to June this year. But one analyst Channel NewsAsia spoke to said this number may not be a cause for alarm - as long as developers space out their launches before their five-year deadline to offload unsold units. \"We believe a lot of our developers have deep pockets and are able to sustain some delay in launches as we’ve seen in the past,\" said Ms Tay Huey Ying, head of Singapore research at JLL Singapore. \"Developers would have a tendency to want to spread out launches over a longer period of time to tap demand over different periods of time, as well as to release units in smaller quantities to test the market in terms of pricing.\" According to data compiled by JLL, an average of 12,159 units were sold annually by developers over the past decade. Based on the estimated unsold supply, about 12,632 units could be released for sale annually between 2018 and 2022 if launches from the current unsold supply are paced out. Private home sales are estimated at about 8,000 to 9,000 this year. This means future supply would be able to adequately meet current and future demand, Ms Tay said. \"The sales volume that developers saw last year was suppressed by low launch supply, and this is why we saw thousands of people flocking the showflats on the night of Jul 5.\" \"That just shows the extent of liquidity and pent-up demand that there is in the market,\" she added. HOME PRICES LIKELY TO REMAIN RESILIENT: ECONOMIST In light of steady economic growth, rising wealth, and a healthy employment market, one economist believes that home prices are likely to remain resilient.  \"The overall gross domestic product (GDP) was graded 3.6 per cent (in 2017) - that's the strongest that we’ve seen in the last couple of years,\" said UOB economist Francis Tan. \"In 2011, if you put S$100 into a Singapore private residential property, your S$100 today in 2018 will give you around S$102. So there’s only a very small appreciation of S$2 across so many years. \"On the other hand, if you put your S$100 in a city like Auckland for example, that will reach S$195 – you will see appreciation. And if you put it in a city like KL you will see S$185,\" Mr Tan said. \"What that means is that compared across time and cities, private residential property prices in Singapore hasn’t really gone up by that much compared to major cities around the world now,\" Mr Tan explained. According to Mr Tan, homebuyers in Singapore have been \"relatively sheltered\" from rising home prices, due to the total debt servicing ratio framework (TDSR) introduced in 2013. \"In Singapore, a typical or average homeowner will see a debt servicing ratio of around 22 per cent,\" said Mr Tan. \"What that means is that for every S$100 of monthly income that a household brings in, around S$22 goes to servicing the home loan.  \"If you compare this today with the situation in Hong Kong, a typical Hong Kong household will see the debt servicing ratio at 67 per cent – what that means is that for every S$100, S$67 goes to the bank in paying down the home loan.\" \"If it’s real demand for occupying space, I think certainly a good time to enter market,\" Mr Tan said. \"But in terms of investment, the Government has signalled clearly it wants to deter investment or speculative flows into the market … so it will be a lot more tougher and painful for investors’ pockets to enter.\" However, analysts says risks remain, including escalating US-China trade tensions and continued interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, as well as further government intervention if home prices continue to rise above 3 per cent every quarter. But barring these external headwinds, there may be another bright spot for the housing market ahead. \"Moving forward, given that the Government is intent on keeping home price increase in tandem with economic fundamentals, we are looking into the future where home prices could potentially grow by 3 to 4 per cent per annum,\" Ms Tay said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/private-housing-market-unlikely-oversupply-tre-ver-absd-10551348"}, {"datetime": "21 Jul 2018 10:57PM", "tags": ["Pink Dot", "LGBTQ", "Hong Lim Park", "Speakers' Corner"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Pink Dot celebrates 10th edition", "content": " SINGAPORE: Hong Lim Park was covered in large swathes of pink on Saturday (Jul 21) as supporters turned up for the 10th edition of the annual lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) rally Pink Dot.  While mostly attended by young Singaporeans, older folks like 70-year-old Frankie Kwok and his family were seen among the sea of pink attendees. \"I am a pioneer so I am supporting a lot of my young friends for equal rights ...

Aside from the concert, which featured local comic Hirzi and Singapore Idol alumnus Tabitha Nauser and Sezairi, former Pink Dot ambassadors pledged their support in making 10 declarations towards equality.  They include declarations such as being ready to stand by LGBTQ friends and family members to having schools, healthcare services, and businesses that are LGBTQ-friendly.  This year's Pink Dot saw 113 local sponsors through the Red Dot for Pink Dot initiative after foreigner-majority sponsors were barred from supporting the event in 2016.  Particular attention was paid to active community participation this year, with the first ever Pink Fest that spanned two weekends in the run-up to Pink Dot. The festival is made up of 20 community events ranging from film screenings to walking tours organised by businesses, groups and individuals.  “We mark our 10th edition with hope and optimism for the future, but are also mindful that plenty more still remains to be done for Singapore to fully embrace the tenets of inclusion, diversity and equality,” said Mr Paerin Choa, a Pink Dot spokesperson. “As we celebrate this milestone, witnessing Speaker’s Corner awash in pink, let us remember that, just as we’ve been forced to erect barriers that separate us from friends and family members here, the LGBTQ community are likewise still restricted by discriminating laws and social prejudice.

Comprising RSS Tenacious, Australia’s HMAS Toowoomba, Malaysia’s KD Lekiu, Peru’s BAP Ferre, South Korea’s ROKS Dae Jo Young, and the United States' USS Sterett, the RSN’s Task Unit will conduct training and scenario-based missions across the surface, air and sub-surface dimensions of naval warfare. Taking on duties as Commander Task Group, the RSN will also lead Peru’s BAP Ferre, Chile’s CNS Lynch, the US’ USS Lake Erie and USS William P Lawrence, as well as multinational helicopters and aircraft in the conduct of anti-submarine warfare training.   Meanwhile, on Jul 20, the RSS Tenacious also conducted a successful simultaneous time-on-target harpoon surface-to-surface live missile firing, which involved the firing of two missiles to hit a target at the same time, said MINDEF.  In the ministry's news release, Commanding Officer of RSS Tenacious Lieutenant Colonel Lee Jan highlighted the value of the RSN’s participation in large-scale exercises like the Ex RIMPAC.  \"Exercise RIMPAC is a useful platform for the RSN to train with established navies from around the world and hone our warfare capabilities,\" said the commanding officer. \"With the involvement of many air and sea platforms, participation in this exercise allows the RSN to improve our interoperability with partner navies and to better understand how they operate.\" \"Most importantly, the exercise gives us the opportunity to forge friendships and build closer cooperation with the multinational navies involved.”   Commenting on RSS Tenacious’ participation in the exercise, Commander of the US Third Fleet Vice Admiral John D Alexander said the exercise was an opportunity to build \"invaluable relationships\". “We are all maritime nations, we all prosper through trade, and the majority of the trade goes through the Indo-Pacific region,\" he said. \"Exercise RIMPAC is an opportunity to build invaluable relationships and partnerships.\" \"The relationships we are building here with Singapore and many others will enable us to work together to provide disaster relief, combat piracy, or conduct a wide range of maritime contingency operations when the need arises.” This is the sixth Ex RIMPAC that the RSN has participated in over the last 10 years.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-navy-participates-in-rim-of-the-pacific-exercise-off-10551114"}, {"datetime": "21 Jul 2018 03:45PM", "tags": ["Kylie Jenner", "Savina Chai", "social media", "influencer"], "author": "", "title": "'We woke up first, we were the last to sleep and the last to eat': Behind the glam on Instagram", "content": " SINGAPORE: Scroll through style influencer Savina Chai’s Instagram account, and you might be filled with awe and envy. Although just 24 years old, she has been active on social media since she was 18, and has collaborated with French luxury fashion houses Chanel and Louis Vuitton. From her photos, it would appear that her life revolves around posing in posh clothes, feasting on photogenic food in fancy restaurants, and living it up in fabulous five-star hotels. As picture-perfect as it may seem, Ms Chai says most of it is an illusion. “Yes, we do have a lot of free perks but it comes with a lot of hard work, persistence and dedication. We have to travel in luxury because the luxury clients are the ones who can pay us and endorse us to travel and promote that lifestyle,” she said on this week's Asia Business First podcast. The pace of her latest press trip abroad, for example, was anything but luxurious.   “Upon landing, we were on our phones, replying all our emails and our clients. We are constantly working on the go. We have no time to shower, we have to re-do our makeup, change our clothes and follow the itinerary. Sometimes the itinerary ends quite late, at 9pm or 10pm. But we have to wake up by 3am to travel to our next destination to shoot the sunrise because of the good light.  \"Sometimes it is because we don’t want to have tourists in the backdrop. So it is a lot of hard work.” That hard work has paid off for Ms Chai, who boasts more than 76,000 followers on Instagram – a respectable figure for a local influencer. While an influencer’s reach is important, Wendy Toh, the founder and CEO of March Media, says the size of one’s following is not always a priority for sponsors. Ms Toh’s job is to propose campaign ideas and influencers to the brands with which they are collaborating, and recently she has noticed that companies are willing to work with “micro-influencers”. That is, influencers with a following of about 1,000 or 2,000. “Brands feel that they have a more authentic kind of voice compared to people in the one-, two- or three-hundred thousand reach. But of course, they still go for higher influencers, with let’s say a 50- or 70,000 following,” she said on the podcast. Not wanting to be left behind, Singapore’s leading broadcaster Mediacorp has also ventured into this space. In September 2017, it launched the Mediacorp Creators Network, Bloomr.SG, for creators to deliver more content. Diogo Martins, program manager of the Mediacorp Creators Network says they recruit promising creators and provide them with the platform and resources to optimise their content and brand. And it seems that they are looking for more than just a pretty face. Mr Martins said: “Usually it is potential in terms of the quality of content produced. The storytelling, how they shoot it is a very important part of it. Simply because we, as a broadcaster, think of content and video as the main focus of our business. Likewise, the creators that we bring on board have to be specialised in that type of content.” Kylie Jenner, 20, of the hit reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, has leveraged her fame to develop a massive following on social media. She has 21 million followers on Facebook and over 111 million followers on Instagram. And she has made the most of that following to build up her beauty empire, Kylie Cosmetics, which is thought to be worth around US$800 million. Style influencer, Savina Chai, uses Kylie Jenner’s half-sister Kim Kardashian as an example to explain how their business strategy works. “I think one big reason why the Kardashians have such a huge following is that they are as transparent as they can be with their fans, and constantly talking to their fans.  \"Kim Kardashian uses Twitter as a conversation starter with her fans. She will ask them what they had for breakfast, what they had for lunch. So they feel like Kim Kardashian is their friend. So, subconsciously, when you are a friend to that celebrity – first you get loyalty and then you get customer acquisition. Because her fans feel, ‘She is my friend, I am going to support her all the way'.\" However, it remains to be seen whether such a strategy would work in Asia, which is home to a range of diverse cultures and ethnicities.

Young people of all ages will be reminded by their teachers, the media, and politicians, about the horrifying consequences of racial and religious conflict. In addition to the events organised during Racial Harmony Day, the message of societal harmony is also consistently reiterated in primary and secondary school Social Studies, secondary school history, and in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) classes. Notably, one of the six National Education messages is: \"We must preserve racial and religious harmony.\" The race riots of 1964 and the Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 are at the centre of the narrative of harmony in Singapore. Students learn about the causes and consequences of these conflicts to Singapore in primary and secondary school.  Within the curriculum, these examples of societal conflict are also positioned as existential threats to Singapore’s national survival. In my analysis of the social studies and CCE curricula published recently, I showed how the curricula emphasise the importance of political order, peace, and social stability. I also showed how the curricula constantly reminds students that the “forces of divisiveness” - a phrase used in an earlier version of the secondary social studies syllabus - will result in the disintegration of society and thus pose an existential threat to the nation. Unsurprisingly, therefore, a consistent message conveyed in the curricula is the importance of minimising differences and avoiding conflict within society for the sake of national unity and the common good. The CCE curriculum, for example, emphasises maintaining good relationships with others, developing communication and interpersonal skills, and acquiring skills of conflict management and resolution. REVIEW WHAT RACIAL HARMONY MEANS It is clear that concept of harmony has been central to Singapore’s political discourse and education system.   But what does harmony mean? What is the role of conflict in harmony? Twenty one years after the first Racial Harmony Day, it is imperative that we critically re-examine some of the fundamental tenets of not only this event but also our broader understanding of the concept of harmony and social cohesion. The goals of social unity, stability, peace, and conflict management are worthy ones. I also agree that it is important to equip students with an understanding of the historical antecedents and potential consequences of racial and religious riots in Singapore’s history. However, this is insufficient for several reasons. First, the extreme examples of societal conflict highlighted in the curricula (which includes mass riots) can result in the lack of attention paid to more productive and manageable parts of conflict and controversy. Consequently, it is easy to draw the mistaken conclusion that all forms of conflict between groups is always bad and violent. HARMONY IS NOT UNIFORMITY Second, the use of extreme examples of conflict such as destructive riots (and the implicit association of harmony with the absence of conflict) greatly limits students’ understanding of the concept of harmony. Harmony, according to Confucian scholars such as Chenyang Li and Sungmoon Kim, not only emphasises partnership and balance but also inescapably highlights difference. Rather than seeing contests between differing groups and perspectives as divisive, this view of harmony suggests that different kinds of conflict can potentially strengthen democratic societies. Harmony, therefore, embraces differences and recognises how they can be complementary and interconnected. A musical analogy illustrates the distinction between harmony and uniformity: An orchestra requires a range of musical instruments playing different yet complementary melodies and notes. Excessive sameness or uniformity, such as the same instruments playing the same notes, is the opposite of harmony. HARMONY NEEDS REFLECTION Third, it is also important to recognise that the process of harmony requires a kind of incivility and critical reflection. If there are issues of injustice or inequity in society, it is more productive, in the long run, to challenge and even revise the status quo, even if it means temporarily upsetting existing social relations. Without this opportunity to address issues of injustice and inequality in society, the position of dominant groups will be strengthened because it delegitimises other areas of conflict and the concerns of disadvantaged groups. This can potentially exacerbate societal divisions in the long run and result in a less harmonious society. REFLECT, DELIBERATE, FACILITATE DISCUSSIONS What implications does this expansive definition of harmony have for Singapore society and more specifically, for social studies and citizenship education? As a starting point, we should teach young people how to identify structural or systemic inequities and recognise how particular groups of people have been marginalised or disadvantaged within society. We should not suppress these important ideas and opinions in the name of stability and social order. Next, we should encourage young people to deliberate these potentially contentious issues by using powerful arguments and providing strong and compelling evidence. We should not limit ourselves to extreme examples of societal conflict in order to convey the idea that all forms of conflict as destructive and is something to be avoided at all cost. Finally, an expanded view of harmony suggests the need to facilitate, rather than inhibit, the teaching and discussion of controversial issues, in order to explicitly encourage the respectful exchange of critical and potentially unconventional perspectives and ideas. Consequently, it is crucial for all of us to reflect and think deeply about the diverse and very different meanings of harmony and social cohesion to different groups of people.

Watching others play their mobile games and playing with his friends on their mobile phones in his primary school years was how KC (not his real name) got interested in online gaming. “Initially, it was a past-time thing, where there was no competitive pressure,” KC, who is now 19, told Channel NewsAsia. “Sometimes, my friends and classmates would compete but it wasn’t a big deal.” Things changed as he got older. KC recounted: “I moved to secondary school and started getting bullied. I didn’t have a lot of friends during that time but I saw a lot of people playing StarCraft, League of Legends and Counter-Strike. So I started playing and realised that I wasn’t that bad at them. “In fact, a lot of people would only talk to me about League of Legends and that was it.” It was during this time that he would isolate himself, sitting in an empty room just watching videos on gaming strategies. He would also play League of Legends through the night and not sleep at times because it was easier to progress through the game’s ranking ladder, the teenager shared. “Looking back, I think that was when it started to become addictive,” KC admitted. “That was when I would sacrifice sleep and other responsibilities just to play. “At that point, I started taking the game a lot more seriously, as if it was something that my whole life depended on, and less as a past-time.” What began as a passing interest for KC morphed into a full-blown addiction, and it was a phase that lasted for at least four years. “I think the lowest moment for me was letting my addiction affect my family ties, to the point where they took drastic actions to curb my addiction,” said KC. KC’s struggles with online gaming are not unique. In fact, the issue of addiction to video games was recently thrown into the spotlight when the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised it as a mental health disorder and included in its International Classification of Diseases. Gaming disorder is defined as a pattern of gaming behaviour, whether digital or video gaming, characterised by impaired control over gaming, with priority increasingly given to gaming over other interests and daily activities. Those with a disorder will continue or escalate their game time “despite the occurrence of negative consequences”, the WHO said on its website.  YOUTHS AT RISK In Singapore, information on those with such a disorder is limited. Ms Jenny Liew, senior counsellor at the Institute of Mental Health’s National Addictions Management Service (NAMS), told Channel NewsAsia in an email that the agency has seen more than 3,000 patients a year from Financial Year 2015 to 2017. During that time, behavioural addictions, which includes gaming, accounted for less than 6 per cent of all cases seen. As it does not separate gaming addiction from the broader category of behavioural addictions, it is difficult for NAMS to determine if more are seeking help for that particular addiction, Ms Liew added. The counsellor did point out that of the 127 adolescent clients who participated in its treatment outcome monitoring programme from FY2012 to FY2017 and who reported they had gaming problems, the youngest client it saw was 10 years old. The majority, or 60 per cent, of them were between the ages of 13 and 15, she said. Another professional, Ms Andrea Chan, shared another set of statistics to show how gaming disorder appears to be becoming more prevalent. The senior counsellor from Touch Youth Intervention, a division of Touch Community Services, cited internal findings that showed that gaming disorder in Singapore is at close to 11 per cent. A 2010 study on pathological video gaming among Singaporean youths stood at 8.7 per cent, it added. Ms Chan shared that based on their interaction with youths and education programmes in schools, her team has observed that the increase in gaming habits is mainly due to the switch from gaming on computers to gaming on devices such as tablets or handphones, which are easily accessible and highly mobile. “That can be a possible contribution to the prevalence of gaming disorder,” the counsellor said. She also corroborated Ms Liew’s finding that while her agency serves pre-schoolers as young as five to those aged 21, the majority of its clients with gaming disorder range from 13 to 15. HELPING HAND For KC, his family’s concern for his well-being, particularly how his younger brother became worried for him, proved to be an important motivating factor for the teen to seek help at non-profit organisation Touch Cyber Wellness at the start of 2016.  “My younger brother would know that I slept late from playing games, so he would set his alarm 15 minutes earlier than mine, just so he could make sure that I would wake up on time,” the teen recounted. “Maybe he didn’t know just how bad the addiction was, but he knew it was bad.” His treatment would include weekly sessions, oftentimes with his counsellor to discuss the consequences of his actions, and allowing him to see how he had changed due to the addiction. They also started having small goals, where every week, KC would try and improve in areas like tolerating the call of the video games. He also recognised that one of the reasons why he had so many problems was “because I thought my family wouldn’t understand why I was addicted to the game”. Touch Youth Intervention’s Ms Chan corroborated KC’s account, saying that many of the youths her division sees are usually unmotivated academically and struggle with parental relationship and conflict. “The presenting issue or symptoms we’ve observed include absenteeism from school, poor school performance, poor relationship with family members, as well as isolating themselves from friends or skipping meals to spend more time on gaming,” the counsellor said. NAMS’ Ms Liew did note the treatment for gaming addiction differs from other addictions even though the former might present similar features. The approach for treating gaming disorder is focused on “modifying dysfunctional use to functional use”, the counsellor explained, whereas the treatment for other addictions may be to recommend stopping the behaviour.  “VIRTUAL REALITY NOT REALITY” Some of the strategies they would pursue include working on the person’s time management skills, practising personal and sleep hygiene and not skipping meals, and improving the child’s relationship with the family and maintaining good communication practices, she elaborated. Ms Chan shared that counsellors at Touch Youth Intervention would have both personal and group counselling sessions with those with gaming disorder, after talking to them and their parents to better understand the condition.   For instance, during some one-to-one counselling sessions, they would play computer games with the youth in a controlled and supervised environment to help them process their behaviour and emotions. “It is at this one-to-one counselling stage where we work on the youth’s motivation to game and address his or her coping mechanism together,” she explained. The group sessions, meanwhile, will see the counsellors help the youths experience the “high” derived from gaming through real-life activities such as sports and music. “(This is) to highlight to them that virtual reality is not reality, and encourage them to make real friends and develop interests apart from online gaming,” Ms Chan said. Since his seven-month treatment in 2016, KC said the process has allowed him to be “more open about my life with others and my family”. He also admitted that moderation is key to preventing his addiction from coming back. “It’s not something you can 100 per cent kick out of your life. As cliched as it sounds, once you’re in it, you’re in it for life,” the 19-year-old said candidly. “You have to learn to moderate your gaming habits and control it so it doesn’t control you.” And what would his advice be to those who might be going through similar struggles with gaming? “Be open about it. As much as you might think you’re alone, you really aren’t,” said KC. “There are people who are truly willing to help you and to do whatever it takes, even if it means going the extra mile.” If someone you know is struggling with gaming disorder, here are some ways to seek help: All Addictions helpline 6-RECOVER (6-7326837), TOUCHline's toll-free number 1800 377 2252 or the National Addictions Management Service website. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/online-gaming-mental-health-disorder-who-10534450"}, {"datetime": "21 Jul 2018 06:16AM", "tags": [], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "From eating disorder to loving food: How one undergrad overcame her condition", "content": " SINGAPORE: Rashyr Perez Ramanathan was 15 years old when comments from her schoolmates and distant relatives made her start hating the way she looked. She was going through adolescence and gaining weight.  She was too fat, they said. Now 25 years old and an undergraduate, Rashyr recalled one incident in her co-ed secondary school that made a mark when a schoolmate asked her whether she had eaten. “I said 'Yeah, have you?' And he said 'It is pretty obvious you’ve eaten’. That just stuck in my head,” she told Channel NewsAsia.  Her attempts to lose weight and the people who made fun of her took her on a topsy-turvy journey through eating disorders, which came with additional health issues that have stayed long after she recovered four years ago.  Recounting her painful experience, she said she first she cut out meat from her diet. Rice was similarly dropped. Within three months, she had shed 15kg. The compliments that came spurred her on, and she wanted to lose more weight.  “I just stopped eating altogether,\" she said.  \"It started becoming this obsession for me – a reward and punishment system, where if I don’t eat that day, I’d be happy, I’d be proud of myself. But if I ate, I’d hate myself so much.” But soon, she started having fainting spells, and her parents knew something was wrong. They started sitting with her to make her eat. That is when she moved on to intentionally vomiting the food she ate. “I just kind of gave in. I would eat, but then I would just wait a while, wait for them to lower their guard, and then I will go to the bathroom and throw it up,” she said. She also could not concentrate on anything, and was insecure, making things up even to her friends to make herself appear “cool”. Her relationships at the time were “toxic”, she said. While she was not diagnosed then, she was exhibiting symptoms of the eating disorder bulimia.  It was only when she was 21 and looking up ways to kill herself that she knew she had to face her demons. She started by telling her mother everything. Her mother then took her to the Institute of Mental Health, where Rashyr was warded for 11 days. Although she had sought help because of depression and anxiety, in unpacking her problems, doctors found out about her eating disorders. “The whole depression part, I used eating to cope with all that. By treating the depression and the anxiety, it kind of helped me not use food as a coping mechanism,” she said. Rashyr has now completely recovered from her eating disorders, but her actions continue to haunt her. “We don’t realise it has lasting effects. Till this day, when I eat, it (her stomach) hurts once in a while and I have to take quite a few pills before I eat to make sure I can digest my food properly, because it’s still a problem for me,” she said. She said family and friends have a big part to play in helping eating disorder patients, but cautioned against taking a tough line. “They think they can scold it out of the person with the disorder, and they think that’s going to help. But it doesn’t. It just pushes the person away. You don’t have to fix us,” she said. Instead, she recommends that family and friends can help by just being there, and being patient. Rashyr regrets losing her golden years to eating disorders “When you’re young, and you’re worrying about your weight so much, those are the best years of your life that you’re never going to get back,” she said. However, the experience drove her and her final-year project mates to raise awareness on eating disorders through a campaign called Breaking Mirrors: You're More Than What You See. They were prompted to raise awareness on these disorders, given that body dissatisfaction - a major causal factor for eating disorders - is common, according to a survey they did. The survey found that 85 per cent of the 267 female participants aged between 18 and 24 were dissatisfied with their body. TYPICAL EATING DISORDER PATIENT FEMALE IN HER 20s: DOCTORS Indeed, the typical eating disorder patient is typically female and from this age profile, doctors Channel NewsAsia spoke to said. Dr Ng Kah Wee, director of the Eating Disorders Programme at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), said the clinic sees patients who are 13 years old and above. They usually present symptoms between the ages of 17 and 22, he said, with the average age being 20. Doctors said that there are several types of eating disorders, and that the most common are anorexia and bulimia. They said that anorexia involves severe restriction of food intake, resulting in a low body weight, often in a relatively short span of time, while bulimia involves eating, followed by compensatory measures to get rid of the ingested food, such as by purging. Dr Ng said that almost half of the cases at the clinic fall in the category of anorexia, 30 per cent are bulimia and the rest are Binge Eating Disorder and unspecified eating disorders. Symptoms of anorexia include consistent excuses to avoid mealtimes or situations involving food, denial of hunger and feeling fat or overweight despite dramatic weight loss.  Symptoms of bulimia include evidence of purging behaviours, like self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, and creation of complex lifestyle schedules or rituals to make time for binge and purge sessions, and withdrawal from usual friends and activities he said. Dr Chee Tji Tjian, from the National University Hospital’s Department of Psychological Medicine added that while eating orders are complex and “affect everyone”, research points to certain risk factors more common in people diagnosed with eating disorders, such as a “perfectionistic” personality and dissatisfaction with body image. MEN CAN SUFFER FROM EATING DISORDERS TOO While Dr Chee said eating disorders disproportionately affect women, men are also susceptible, he said. There appears to be an increase in the number of men diagnosed with an eating disorder, he said, pointing to factors such as an increasing rate of body dissatisfaction among males, “perhaps driven by media depiction of the pursuit of a certain type of muscular, lean physique”. “As eating disorders were often seen as a female illness, cultural stigma of men with eating disorders had likely led to under-reporting and diagnosing in the past,” he added. Psychologist Dr Lim Boon Leng form Gleneagles Hospital said that from his clinical experience, more males are starting to suffer from eating disorders. “This is due to the fixation on masculinity in males these days, again influenced by western media. In male eating disorders, the fixation is often on muscle definition and exercising instead of the obsession on thinness.” While local data is not available, in the United Kingdom, a 70 per cent increase in eating disorders among males was seen between 2010 and 2016, he said. WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF EATING DISORDERS AND HOW TO HELP SUFFERERS Eating disorders can have a serious impact on the physical, emotional and social well-being of sufferers, Dr Ng said. Depending on the type of eating disorder, they could suffer a myriad of physical issues.  These include cardiovascular complications such as low heart pressure and irregular heart rhythm that could be fatal, gastrointestinal difficulties and infertility. \"At times, co-morbid psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder may surface and these conditions would need to be addressed adequately as well,\" Dr Ng said.  The aim of the treatment focuses on a collaborative approach with the patient to achieve healthy eating habits, he added. Other than professionals, friends and family will also have to play a part in a patient’s journey, doctors said. Patients suffering from eating disorders often experience a wide range of guilt, embarrassment, confusion and other negative feelings about their condition, Dr Chee said. The patient’s support network could learn about eating disorders and be kind and supportive, Dr Chee said. He cautioned, however, that it is likely that the patient will be in denial and provide resistance to efforts. “Do not take it personally, and do not give up. Avoid giving simple solutions, because the disorder is complex and likely poorly understood even by himself or herself,” he said. Dr Lim said improving family relationships and dynamics which may be strained due to the patient's condition could help. Dr Ng similar stressed the role family can play. They can can help by encouraging the patient to focus on recovery, to comply and adhere to the treatment recommendations, because the eating disorder often makes one fearful and avoidant of the treatment recommendations, she said. She also encouraged families to avoid statements about food and weight gain during the treatment process which could take time. She suggested refocusing on other areas such as personal accomplishments and personal values. “Family members can encourage normal eating habits by being role models themselves,” she said. Today, it is evident that Rashyr has overcome the worst. “I love food now, I don’t even know why I hated it in the first place. I have such a good relationship with food right now. I love food,” she said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/from-eating-disorder-to-loving-food-how-one-undergrad-overcame-10260928"}, {"datetime": "21 Jul 2018 06:16AM", "tags": ["education", "primary school", "parenting", "St Margaret's"], "author": "June Yong", "title": "Commentary: Move by St Margaret’s Primary a test of parents’ ability to deal with change. Will they rise to the challenge?", "content": " SINGAPORE: We recently received news that my daughter’s school would be shifting come 2020. The school is preparing for a major upgrading exercise and has selected a temporary holding site some 4.5 km away. The sudden news sparked off strong reactions from some angry parents. Some expressed concerns that their child will be preparing for PSLE during the two years at the holding site, and would have to not only adjust to the new school environment, but also the longer travel distance. Others complained about the inconvenience as they have to juggle ferrying other siblings to and from school as well, and this would mean a disruption of their usual route. I was surprised to hear about the upset parents. And I can’t help but wonder, how resilient and future-ready can we expect our children to be if we are not open to change ourselves? DEALING WITH CHANGE GRACIOUSLY Granted, it’s human nature to react to change with a dash of negativity. Like a survival instinct that kicks in, metathesiophobia (or the fear of change) tells us to maintain the status quo. Stick with what is safe and predictable, and avoid the unknown. However, change can be for the better. And in getting out of one’s comfort zone, there are often lessons to learn along the way.      If you think about it, there are many “inconvenient” things that we parents do for the sake of our offspring. We move from one part of Singapore to another to be close to our alma maters. Some of us even rent homes close to our school of choice, to get within the 1 to 2km zone for better chances of entry.   Now that our school of choice needs to shift, it can be frustrating, particularly if you’ve moved close to the school or have no one to help with transporting the kids.  But it may help to look at the bigger picture – the upgrading works will enhance the school’s ageing facilities and create a better environment for its future students, including its current batch of Primary 1 and 2 students. Since we have chosen this school, should we not trust that its leaders have done their best to select a site that meets the needs of its children? On the other hand, could the school have done more to engage parents regarding the move?  Instead of a brief letter that read like an announcement, could it have provided more details at the onset, and provided a space and time for concerned parents to meet the school principal and teachers – especially those who only recently enrolled their children in the school?  While the school did send out a more detailed letter eventually, the truth is that no matter where the new location is, some parents will be more affected than others. PUTTING VALUES IN ACTION One of the strengths of the school is in teaching their students timeless values such as graciousness, integrity and tenacity. The school emphasises a different value each month and sends out reminders to parents to reinforce the learning at home.   Perhaps this change is a chance for us to exercise the values we preach to our children. What sort of values are we modelling to our young if we complain about the slightest changes in distance or travel times? On the flipside, if we choose to be open-minded, they too will learn that change can be embraced. Through the process, they will hone their adaptability and resilience, essential life skills that are much sought-after by employers in a digital age. FINDING THE SILVER LINING My daughter currently takes the school bus to and from school. She will also be in the first batch of students taking the PSLE with the new scoring system in 2021.  When she voiced her sadness at not being able to study at and graduate from her own school, I empathised. But I also encouraged her to find the silver lining. I told her that she’d be in upper primary by then and able to take a public bus on her own.   If we read between the lines, we’d realise that the children’s gripes have nothing to do with travel time or dollars and cents. Theirs is an emotional longing; this is after all a space that represents community, learning and friendship, and that holds fond memories of their growing-up years. It’s only natural for them to yearn to see what the transformed school will be like.   Perhaps we can learn from our girls, and drop our fixation about time and convenience, or the lack of it. Don’t underestimate our children. With our support, I believe they will learn to embrace the changes and challenges ahead with optimism and tenacity. They may even surprise us by adapting to the new environment quicker than we expect.   Hopefully, this shift won’t go down in history as just a narrative of the years that have been lost, but about the values found, and the better environment created for generations of students to come.

It is little wonder that their utilities bill is high. Last month, it was S$353 for their four-room flat, which he thought was “normal”. He was surprised to find out that the average for public flats of that size was about S$140 to S$150. “It’s a big disappointment,” he said. “I could use (the money) for better purposes.” With electricity tariffs rising by 6.9 per cent for this quarter, and the second phase of the 30-per-cent water price hike starting this month, households like his may be increasingly mindful of their energy and water consumption. To help three families, the programme Talking Point enlisted a team of experts to advise them how to manage their electricity and water usage. Smart Distribution Boards were also installed in their homes for them to monitor their energy consumption. (Watch the episode here.) There was an added challenge: To see who could cut down the most. And after a month, Mr Rudy’s household made the biggest saving: 16 per cent (S$56). Here are some of the energy- and water-saving tips the families received: 1. KNOW YOUR GUZZLERS Many Singaporeans are unaware of the energy guzzlers in their homes, according to a survey by Energy Efficient Singapore. In the average household, over three-quarters of the electricity is used to power just three appliances: Air conditioners (36.7 per cent), water heaters (20.9 per cent) and fridges (18.5 per cent). In terms of water, showering uses the most, at 27 per cent, toilet flushing accounts for 18 per cent, while general kitchen usage stands at 16 per cent. 2. HOW TO CUT DOWN THE A.C. (AND SURVIVE THE HEAT)? When Mr Rudy’s housemate complained about their air conditioning usage being cut to 15 hours a day, eco-conscious blogger Jeraldine Phneah suggested they use the fan as a supplement. “One of the things that worked for me was that I can leave the air-con on for about two hours, and then I set the timer to switch it off,” she said. Then I’d let the fan circulate the cold air around the room for the rest of the day. She also suggested they close their room curtains during the day, to block the sunlight and heat, making it more energy efficient to cool their rooms at night. 3. DON’T SKIMP ON SERVICING Despite his air conditioners running for nearly the entire day, Mr Rudy only serviced them once every six months. But he should be servicing them once every three months, since they are used daily, so that they function better and are more energy efficient, said YeoBuild Home Repair managing director Yeo Leng Chye. WATCH: Learn and save (2:54)  “When your air conditioner ages, you can’t achieve 100 per cent (energy efficiency). You’d probably reach only 70 to 80 per cent,” he said. “After that, when you don’t clean it, it would continue to drop (down) to 50 per cent.” And this would increase one’s energy consumption and electricity bill. 4. DON’T OVERLOAD THE WASHER When asked about their laundry load, Mr Rudy said “full load”, to which Mr Yeo replied: “I call this overload.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Overloading the washing machine not only damages it, but also prevents the clothes from getting cleaned properly. “When the motor is stressed, it draws more (electric) current,” he said, adding that the machine should be about three-quarters full at most. 5. LET THE FRIDGE COOL Fridges, too, should not be overloaded. More importantly, enough space must be left around the fridge for heat dissipation. Mr Jason Sim’s family, who live in a four-room flat, used to place a silver sheet beside their fridge to protect it from oil and heat when they cooked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But Mr Yeo advised against this, as the board was affecting the appliance’s ability to cool properly. “The heat isn’t able to disperse (properly). The electricity consumption will be higher,” he said. In Ms Miqi Lina’s two-room flat, the fridge was consuming more energy than usual, making up a third of her electricity bill, according to the Smart Distribution Board (DB). It turned out that the rubber seal around the door, which keeps the cold air in and hot air out, was broken. Her family said they will use a fridge strap to secure it as a temporary measure. 6. USE EXTERNAL TIMERS The fans in Ms Miqi’s home are also switched on for their cats when the family goes out, consuming about 50 watts an hour per fan. But that may not be energy efficient if the windows are closed and there is no ventilation, said Mr Yeo. “You’d be circulating the same heated air within the same area.” Apart from leaving a couple of windows slightly open for ventilation, he suggested they use external timers, which can switch household equipment on and off – at intervals if needed – to cut down their energy consumption. These timers, which he said cost about S$8 apiece, can be particularly useful for those who charge their smartphones overnight. 7. DON’T REBOIL, KEEP THE WATER WARM More power-hungry than a fan is an electric kettle, which typically operates at around 1,000W or higher. And the Sims were using theirs some six or seven times a day. Dr Kwan Kian Hoong, the Smart DB project manager from Temasek Polytechnic, suggested they boil water just once in the daytime, say, at 7am. He told Mr Sim: “Put the hot water in some thermal flask, and use it at around 9am or 10am when your parents need another cup of coffee or tea. So in this way, you can shave half off what you're boiling in the daytime.” 8. RECYCLE WATER FOR MOPPING To reduce water wastage, one can recycle water from the washing machine to mop the floor. To do that, place the drainage hose into a pail and secure it with string, said Mr Yeo. It is important to then monitor the water flow and replace the pail in case it overflows. “There are two rinses in the system. The first rinse would be dirty water – let it go,\" he said. The second rinse is pretty clean water, so you can mop the floor (with it) because you have some residual detergent inside. 9. GO FOR L.E.D. LIGHTS One of the things Ms Phneah highly recommends is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are one of the most energy-efficient light bulbs in the market and are durable. They come in a range of shapes, wattage and light colour. Mr Yeo agreed, saying: “The heat produced is much less (than that from fluorescent light), and gives you a brighter (light).” 10. TRY SOLAR POWER Ms Phneah also uses a solar panel charger to keep her electronic devices full of juice, instead of using the power socket. The panel, which cost her S$99, comes with charging ports, and she would connect a portable charger to it when the panel is in the sun at the window. “So it charges when I'm at work. And when I come back, I’d be able to use that portable charger to charge my phone,” she said. Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

On Friday, the Ministry of Communications and Information and Ministry of Health announced that 1.5 million SingHealth patients’ demographic data were stolen, while 160,000 of them had their outpatient dispensed medicine records taken too. Mr Lee was “specifically and repeatedly” targeted during the attack that took place last month, and hackers managed to steal his personal particulars and medication information. Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong also revealed in a Facebook post that his \"non-medical personal particulars\" with SingHealth had been stolen.   Investigations by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the Integrated Health Information System (IHIS) subsequently found the breach to be a “deliberate, targeted and well-planned cyberattack” and not the work of casual hackers or criminal gangs. Mr Eric Hoh, Asia Pacific president of cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the cyberattack was “very different” from those by typical cybercriminals who generally sell the stolen data or use it for ransomware. This has yet to happen in SingHealth's case since the breach was detected and thwarted on Jul 4. Stealing the medical records of a high-ranking official, for example, would give hackers the opportunity to use the data to “coerce” that person into revealing secrets or giving access to otherwise unattainable resources, Mr Hoh said. Acronis’ lead security researcher Ravikant Tiwari agreed, saying that stolen medical records are most commonly used for aiding in spying if the target is a high-ranking official. Mr Lee said on Friday that he did not know what the people behind the cyberattack were hoping to find from his medication data, but that if they were looking to embarrass him, \"they would have been disappointed\".  \"Perhaps they were hunting for some dark state secret, or at least something to embarrass me. If so, they would have been disappointed,\" Mr Lee said in a Facebook post. \"My medication data is not something I would ordinarily tell people about, but there is nothing alarming in it,\" Mr Lee added. THE HAND OF A NATION-STATE ACTOR Asked why he thought the SingHealth cyberattack could be the work of a nation-state actor, Mr Hoh said: “This was an advanced persistent threat (APT) and the nature of such attacks are that they are conducted by nation states using very advanced tools. “They tend to be well resourced, well-funded and highly sophisticated,” he explained. Additionally, the perpetrator carried on trying to access SingHealth’s network even after detection, which is the “typical signature” of a nation-state actor, the FireEye executive pointed out. Channel NewsAsia understands that the authorities have established who might be behind such an attack. There are only a few countries in the world who have the level of sophistication shown during the cyberattack campaign. CSA could not reveal more details due to operational security reasons, said its chief executive David Koh during Friday’s press conference. MEDICAL DATA IS LUCRATIVE BUSINESS Another cybersecurity expert, Mr Leonard Kleinman, pointed out that medical data contains a trove of information – from personally identifiable data to financial details – “that can be used to create a highly sought-after composite of an individual”. Such pilfered data can fetch a high price on the dark Web, with each entry potentially selling for US$50 to US$100 more than stolen credit card data, said Mr Kleinman, who is the chief Cyber Security Advisor at RSA Asia Pacific and Japan. “As it could contain any amount and level of information, healthcare institutions are among the most sought-after industries by criminals who can be motivated by a multitude of possible reasons,” he said. The executive also cautioned that the fallout of such a hack may not be immediately felt either, as it could “take months” for the data to be first sold, then used. “Given the nature of this attack, it is hard to say exactly what the end game is, especially when the attackers haven’t identified themselves,” Mr Kleinman added. Darktrace Asia Pacific managing director Sanjay Aurora told Channel NewsAsia in an email that it can only speculate on the hacker's motives, but medical information, like other kinds of personal data, can be easily monetised.  That said, beyond making a quick buck, Mr Aurora said a more \"sinister reason\" could be to cause widespread disruption and systemic damage to the healthcare service or to undermine trust in a nation's competency to keep personal data safe.  \n\n\n\n\n WHAT CAN AFFECTED SINGAPOREANS DO? As for next steps, FireEye’s Hoh suggested that the 1.5 million affected SingHealth users be on “heightened alert” and be extra vigilant over things such as phone calls from unknown numbers or emails that purport to be from legitimate organisations. He also said that these users should change their online passwords linked to the compromised IT systems. Sophos senior technologist Paul Ducklin, meanwhile, recommends those affected to keep a careful watch over their financial statements and report any suspicious activity immediately. “Be especially suspicious of unsolicited communications that arrive in the wake of this breach offering any sort of help or asking for further details to assist in the investigation,” Mr Ducklin warned. “Social engineers and scammers are experts at preying on people's fears (and their willingness to help) after security incidents of this sort.” He added: “Whether this was a lone hacker who got lucky, a well-oiled cybercrime gang or a state-sponsored attack team won't get your personal data back, and it won't change the fact that you can't control who gets it next. “Keep your own eyes open for any attempt to abuse your personal data in the future.\" Mr Hoh also hopes that Singaporeans will see this incident as a timely reminder that cyberattacks, big or small, will happen and that the key is for all parties - government, businesses and citizens - to respond quickly to such breaches. \"Somebody can launch a cyberattack against you, but if they didn't get away with anything, then you'd have successfully defended yourself.\" This, he reckoned, is the mindset people should adopt going forward.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-likely-nation-state-medical-data-price-10549372"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 09:22PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Loong", "People's Association", "RC", "NC"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "New Residents’ Network to serve HDB, private estate dwellers", "content": " SINGAPORE: New Housing Board flats and private developments will be served by one Residents' Network (RN), instead of having separate Residents' Committees (RCs) and Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) for HDB and private estate dwellers, respectively. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced this on Friday (Jul 20) at an event held at the Singapore Expo to celebrate the 40th anniversary of RCs and 20th anniversary of NCs. Both committees are part of the grassroots network of the People’s Association (PA). “This way, new flats and private developments can come under one RN, rather than one RC and a separate NC,” he said. Explaining the idea behind having one combined entity, Mr Lee, who is also the PA chairman, said that “quite a few” RC and NC leaders suggested removing the distinction between the committees. RCs and NCs are no longer as separate or distinct as they used to be, he said. “This will encourage residents from public and private estates to mix more freely,\" he said. Mr Lee said that eight in 10 NCs have a neighbouring RC, because of private and public housing developments that were deliberately planned near each other. EXISTING RCs AND NCs CAN DECIDE WHAT TO DO  Existing RCs and NCs can decide whether they want to rename themselves as RNs, or re-organise and merge into a single entity, said Mr Lee. He acknowledged that many RCs and NCs have a long history, heritage and identity which they might want to preserve, and existing networks and bonds within their communities that are precious, which he said should be maintained. \"Nonetheless, I encourage you to look for new ways to work more closely and collaborate with neighbouring RCs and NCs. Perhaps one day, you will feel less of a need to have separate groups, and be more comfortable and confident with one another to decide to merge,\" he said. During engagement sessions organised by the PA Headquarters with RC and NC leaders, one idea that was “intensively discussed” was how these committees can work more closely with one another, he said. He added that working closer together can also help the committees pool resources and reach out to people more effectively. FEWER YOUNG FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IN RC AND NC EVENTS  RCs and NCs have to understand their residents well, and organise themselves and their activities to meet their needs and interests, in order to continue being successful, Mr Lee said, drawing particular attention to young residents. “Today, fewer young families and children participate in RC and NC events. They have more options for entertainment,” he said. He noted that some traditional RC and NC activities may no longer be as attractive to this group, as younger people tend to spend more time at home, playing computer games or surfing social media, instead of being out with neighbours. “We have to make a special effort to reach out to them, to get young people to join RCs and NCs, to organise activities that they find interesting, and also by using social media ourselves,” he said. He suggested that RCs and NCs can also look out for opportunities to work with other groups that are not part of the grassroots network, such as other interest groups, clans, youth organisations, and religious bodies. He also reminded grassroots leaders who are volunteers that they must always conduct themselves properly, “never pushing your weight around, or taking improper advantage of your position”, not just during official functions, but also in everyday situations. “As grassroots leaders, people see you not only as private persons, but also as representing government and authority. So it is only natural that very high standards are expected, and these high standards must be adhered to,” he said.

To illustrate just how serious it was, the attack also “specifically and repeatedly” targeted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s personal particulars and outpatient medication data. Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong also revealed in a Facebook post that his \"non-medical personal particulars\" with SingHealth had been stolen.  Confidential records belonging to the 1.5 million patients, including their names, NRIC numbers and addresses, were illegally accessed and copied. Of this group, 160,000 had their dispensed medicines’ records stolen too. Here’s what you need to know: 1) Timeline On Jul 4, administrators detected unusual activity on one of SingHealth’s IT databases and “acted immediately” to halt the activity. As investigations continued, they implemented additional cybersecurity precautions. Six days later, investigations confirmed that it was a cyberattack, and the Ministry of Health, SingHealth and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) were informed. It was established that data was stolen from Jun 27 to Jul 4. SingHealth lodged a police report on Jul 12. \n\n\n\n\n 2) How did it happen? It has been established that the attackers accessed the SingHealth IT system through an initial breach on a front-end work station. They then managed to obtain privileged account credentials to access to the database. 3) Who’s affected? If you visited one of SingHealth’s specialist outpatient clinics or polyclinics between May 1, 2015 and Jul 4, 2018, chances are that you are affected. Over the next five days, SingHealth will send a text message to each of the 1.5 million patients affected and inform them if their records were stolen. Those without a registered mobile number will be sent a letter within the next week. Patients can also access this URL to check if their data were compromised.    4) What to do if you are affected? Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that those affected should look out for “abnormalities” and “unusual activities” in their emails and transactions. If anything looks out of place, contact the authorities immediately. Those whose medicine records were stolen will also be given a hotline number to call. 5) Should you be worried? In short, not really, said the authorities. CSA chief executive David Koh said the stolen information are “basic demographic data”. “We are watching to see if anything appears on the Internet both in the open and in some of the less well-known websites,” he added, noting that this has occasionally happened in past data breaches. “But considering the type of data that’s been exfiltrated, it is – from our professional experience – unlikely that these will appear, because there is no strong commercial value to these types of data.” \n\n\n\n\n Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran said breaches of this scale are not uncommon in other countries. For example, the UK’s National Health Service has been hacked before. “These occurrences have happened even in some of the most secure systems around the world,” he added. “So I think we have to keep the incident in perspective and then allow due process to take its course.” 5) What’s the extent of the hacking? Crucial patient records, such as diagnosis, tests results or doctor’s notes, were not stolen. None of the stolen data have been published in the public domain either. There has also been no evidence of a similar breach in the other public healthcare and Government IT systems. \n\n\n\n\n 6) What’s next? In addition to police investigations, a Committee of Inquiry will be set up to establish the events and contributing factors leading to the attack and the response to the incident. The committee will also make recommendations on improvements. Authorities will also conduct a “thorough review” of the public healthcare system with the help of third-party experts to improve cyberattack prevention, detection and response. Outside healthcare, the CSA will work closely with key sectors such as banking and finance to improve the security of their Critical Information Infrastructure systems. 7) Who’s responsible for the attack? Channel NewsAsia understands that authorities know who might be behind the attack. There are only a few countries in the world who have shown this level of sophistication when it comes to cyberattacks. When pressed further, Mr Koh apologised, saying: “We are not able to reveal more because of operational security reasons.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-what-you-need-to-know-10549096"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 07:50PM", "tags": ["Teo Chee Hean", "Indonesia"], "author": "Saifulbahri Ismail", "title": "DPM Teo Chee Hean expresses hope for smooth, peaceful Indonesia elections", "content": " JAKARTA: Indonesia will hold its legislative and presidential elections next year, and Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has expressed hope that these elections will be smooth and peaceful.

Low was killed at the ITE College Central car park on Thursday (Jul 19) night. Channel NewsAsia understands that her ex-husband was also conveyed to the hospital with a stab wound to his stomach and scratches on his chest.  The suspect, 66-year-old Seet Cher Hng, has been arrested.  Pastor Buntain added that Low was a positive person and never said anything negative.  \"Everyone who met her would immediately fall in love with her gentle ways. She always had good things to say about people. So she was living a life of unusual peace,\" he said. According to the church's blog, Low was baptised last Christmas eve after being introduced to its services two years ago.

We would like to assure students, staff and members of the public that security measures are in place to safeguard the safety of our campus,\" the note said.

A student who gave her name as Anisa said that many elderly people from the Ang Mo Kio area frequent the campus' supermarket and that it is a busy area.   Another ITE student said he was surprised by the incident because murder cases are rare, especially one within a school campus. Perhaps the ITE can consider strengthening its security measures and get security guards to be more aware in order to make it safer, he added.  Member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education Ang Wei Neng said that it is \"worrisome\" to allow easy access to non-staff or students to the covered car park.  \"It suggests that the security of the campus needs enhancement, be it in the form of more frequent patrol, installation of more CCTV with better monitoring system or better access control. This is especially so when the campus is frequently used for National events,\" said Mr Ang. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ite-murder-victim-was-a-beautiful-gentle-and-joyful-person-10548074"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 05:35PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Loong", "SingHealth", "cyberattack"], "author": "", "title": "If they were looking to embarrass me, they would've been disappointed: PM Lee on SingHealth cyberattackers", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (Jul 20) he did not know what the people behind the major cyberattack on SingHealth's database were hoping to find from his medication data, but that if they were looking to embarrass him, \"they would have been disappointed\".  \"The attackers targeted my own medication data, specifically and repeatedly,\" PM Lee wrote in a Facebook post. \"I don’t know what the attackers were hoping to find.

Of this group, about 160,000 patients had their medicine records leaked. The attackers, however, \"specifically and repeatedly\" targeted Mr Lee's personal particulars and information on his outpatient dispensed medicines, said SingHealth.  A probe showed it was a \"deliberate, targeted and well-planned cyberattack\" that was \"not the work of casual hackers or criminal gangs\", SingHealth said.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lee-hsien-loong-major-singhealth-cyberattack-data-breach-10548402"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 05:29PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "MOH", "MCI", "S Iswaran", "Gan Kim Yong"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Singapore health system hit by ‘most serious breach of personal data’ in cyberattack; PM Lee's data targeted", "content": " SINGAPORE: The \"most serious breach of personal data” in Singapore’s history took place last month, with 1.5 million SingHealth patients’ records accessed and copied while 160,000 of those had their outpatient dispensed medicines’ records taken, according to the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Communications and Information. Among those affected was Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, with the attackers “specifically and repeatedly targeting” his personal particulars and information of his outpatient dispensed medicines, the ministries said in a joint release on Friday (Jul 20). Several other ministers were also affected, including Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong. The personal data taken from the 1.5 million patients include their names, NRIC numbers, address, gender, race and date of birth, the release said, adding that the hackers did not amend or delete the records.  Patients’ medical records, including past diagnosis, doctors’ notes and health scans, were not affected. “We have not found evidence of a similar breach in the other public healthcare IT systems,” they said.  \"UNPRECEDENTED\" ATTACK At a news conference on Friday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong apologised to patients affected. Calling the attack \"unprecedented\", Mr Gan said: \"I'm deeply sorry that this has happened ... We must learn from this and emerge stronger and more resilient from this incident.\" Also at the conference was Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran who vowed to get to the bottom of the breach.  \"I want to assure everyone that the Government takes with utmost seriousness its responsibility of ensuring the security of public sector IT systems and databases,\" he said. Investigations by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the Integrated Health Information System (IHIS) confirmed that the attack was a “deliberate, targeted and well-planned cyberattack” and was not the work of casual hackers or criminal gangs. Channel NewsAsia understands that authorities have established who might be behind such an attack. There are only a few countries in the world who have the level of sophistication shown during the cyberattack campaign. \"I apologise. We are not able to reveal more because of operational security reasons,\" CSA chief executive David Koh said at the news conference when asked which country might have been involved. None of the stolen data has surfaced in the public domain, including that of the prime minister. \"The attackers deliberately, repeatedly and specifically targeted his information and they were able to access and copy the dispensed medication record of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,\" Mr Koh said. \"It's perhaps best not to speculate what the attacker had in mind,\" he added in response to a question on why Mr Lee's data was targeted. In an Facebook post, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong revealed that his non-medical personal particulars with SingHealth had also been stolen.  \"Cyber theft is a key risk when going digital. But we cannot stop the digital advance and must strive to build the most secure Smart Nation,\" he added.   SOPHISTICATED ATTACK According to MCI and MOH, IHIS database administrators detected unusual activity on one of SingHealth’s IT databases on Jul 4, and acted immediately to stop it. They carried on their investigations, while putting in place additional security measures, the release said. \n\n\n\n\n From Jul 4 to Jul 9, they continued to monitor the network traffic closely before ascertaining it was a cyberattack and alerted superiors. On Jul 10, MOH, SingHealth and CSA were informed and forensic investigations were carried out. It was found that data was taken out from Jun 27 to Jul 4 this year, and the patient records accessed and copied were from those who visited SingHealth’s specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics from May 1, 2015, to Jul 4 this year. CSA ascertained the cyberattackers first accessed the network after breaching a front-end workstation, and managed to get privileged access to the database over time while also showing sophistication in cleaning up their digital footprints when doing so.  SingHealth has since lodged a police report on Jul 12, and police investigations are ongoing. These investigations are separate from those looking into the cyberattack, Channel NewsAsia understands. Since kicking the cyberattacker out of the system on Jul 4, further attacks were observed but no further data were illegally stolen, the ministries said, adding there was no disruption of healthcare services during the period of the cyberattack and patient care has not been compromised. \n\n\n\n\n STEPPING UP SECURITY The ministries also said further measures have been introduced to tighten SingHealth’s IT security, including imposing Internet separation policies. Additional controls on workstations and servers have also been introduced, as well as the resetting of user and systems accounts and installation of more system monitoring controls. Furthermore, SingHealth will be progressively contacting all patients who visited its clinics and polyclinics during the abovementioned time period to notify them if their data has been stolen. All patients, whether or not they are affected, will receive an SMS notification over the next five days. They can also proactively access the Health Buddy mobile app or SingHealth website to check if they have been affected, the release said. MOH has also directed IHiS to conduct a thorough review of the public healthcare system here, with support from third-party experts. Areas of review include cybersecurity policies, threat management processes, IT system controls and organisational and staff capabilities. Advisories have also been sent to all healthcare institutions, public and private, on the cybersecurity precautions and measures to be taken, the release added. \n\n\n\n\n COI TO BE CONVENED Separately, the Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity S Iswaran on Friday will convene a Committee of Inquiry, to be headed by Mr Richard Magnus, a retired Chief District Judge and member of the Public Service Commission. More details of its members and terms of reference, as well as when the COI will be held, will be revealed at a later date, MCI said. Addressing reporters at a news conference, Mr Iswaran said: \"Because this incident occurred in the SingHealth IT system and is within the healthcare cluster, that has to be the natural focal point of the COI’s work.\" However, to be meaningful it also has to draw lessons or policy recommendations that can be applied to the public sector and potentially the private sector, he added. Mr Iswaran has also directed CSA to work closely with all 11 keys sectors - energy, water, banking and finance, healthcare, transport, Infocomm, media, security and emergency services and Government - to enhance the security of their critical information infrastructure systems. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group has also completed a scan of all government systems and found no evidence of compromise, he said. There will be a pause in the introduction of new ICT systems in the interim, until their respective reviews have been completed and security posture established, it added. \"We cannot return to the days of paper and pencil but we will take a pause of our various IT-related projects ... to review and strengthen our cybersecurity measures if necessary, before proceeding,\" Mr Gan said, adding that this includes the National Electronic Health Record project. There were no further details on which ICT projects will be paused, but these could possibly include SingPass Mobile, Channel NewsAsia understands.  \"We will do our utmost to secure our IT systems. However, unfortunately, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of another cybersecurity attack,\" Mr Iswaran said at the conference. This is due to attackers constantly developing new techniques and probing for fresh weaknesses in IT systems.  \"This is an ongoing battle ... however, we must not allow this incident, or any others like it, to derail our plans for a Smart Nation,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-health-system-hit-serious-cyberattack-pm-lee-target-10548318"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 05:29PM", "tags": ["SingHealth", "cyberattack"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "SingHealth will notify patients affected by cyberattack; Government to order Committee of Inquiry", "content": " SINGAPORE: Starting from Friday (Jul 20) evening and over the next five days, SingHealth will progressively send a text message to each of the 1.5 million patients who visited its specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics from May 1, 2015 to Jul 4, 2018 to notify them if their medicine records had been illegally extracted or not. For those with no registered mobile number, a letter will be sent to their address within a week. These 1.5 million patients had their non-medical records – including name, NRIC, address and date of birth – illegally accessed and copied in the cyberattack. Of this group, about 160,000 patients had their medicine records stolen. Those whose medicine records were stolen will be given a specific hotline to call. No other patient records, such as diagnosis, tests results or doctor’s notes, were breached. “Patients can also access the Health Buddy mobile app or SingHealth website to check if they are affected by this incident,” the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a joint statement on Friday (Jul 20).    At a news conference on Friday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said affected patients should be looking out for \"unusual activities in their emails and various transactions\". \"If they notice any of this, they can always contact the authorities so that we can follow up,\" he said. The cyberattack, which investigations had confirmed on Jul 10 was “deliberate, targeted and well-planned”, is Singapore’s most serious personal data breach to date. “It was not the work of casual hackers or criminal gangs,” the ministries said. The Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), the technology agency for the public healthcare sector, first detected “unusual activity” on one of SingHealth’s IT databases on Jul 4. Following investigations, it was established that data was extracted from Jun 27 to Jul 4. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s personal particulars and outpatient medication data were “specifically and repeatedly” targeted, the ministries said.  Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong also revealed that his \"non-medical personal particulars\" with SingHealth had been stolen.  SingHealth lodged a police report on Jul 12. Police investigations are ongoing. Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity S Iswaran will convene a Committee of Inquiry (COI) to establish the events and contributing factors leading to the cyberattack and the response to the incident, which has “serious public health and safety implications”. “It will also recommend measures to better manage and secure SingHealth’s and other public sector IT systems against similar cybersecurity attacks in future,” MCI said. Retired Senior District Judge and Public Service Commission member Richard Magnus will chair the COI, whose composition and terms of reference will be revealed at a “later date”. \n\n\n\n\n STRENGTHENING IT SYSTEMS Meanwhile, the Government said it will take “immediate action” to strengthen its IT systems against similar attacks. To that end, Mr Iswaran has directed the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore to work closely with key sectors – including the energy and banking and finance industries – to improve the security of their Critical Information Infrastructure systems. “The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) has completed a scan of all Government systems and found no evidence of compromise,” MCI said. “SNDGG will pause the introduction of new ICT systems while it reviews the cybersecurity measures of Government systems, and implements any additional security safeguards which are necessary.” On another level, MOH has directed IHiS to conduct a “thorough review” of the public healthcare system with the help of third-party experts to improve cyberattack prevention, detection and response. Areas of review include cybersecurity policies, threat management processes, IT system controls and organisational and staff capabilities. “Advisories have been sent to all healthcare institutions, public and private, on the cybersecurity precautions and measures to be taken,” the ministries said. “The Government takes a serious view of any cyberattack, illegal access of data or action that compromises the confidentiality of data in Singapore.” When asked how the Government will restore public confidence following the massive data breach, Mr Iswaran laid out three measures. First, steps have been taken to contain the problem and eliminate the risk of further data leaking, he said. Second, the SNDGG has also concluded that there is no evidence of a compromise in other Government IT systems. \"The third is to learn from this in order to put in place additional safeguard measures which may be necessary in order to forestall future cyberattacks of this nature,\" he added. \"At the same time, the COI’s work will also inform that process, and I think we may be able to yield some additional insights as to what we may need to do in order to further secure IT systems in the Government.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-notify-patients-cyberattack-committee-of-inquiry-10548222"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 03:40PM", "tags": ["SMRT", "Land Transport Authority"], "author": "", "title": "SMRT to be fined S$1.9 million for Pasir Ris fatal accident, flooding", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Friday (Jul 20) said that it intends to impose financial penalties totalling S$1.9 million on SMRT for the fatal accident which took place near Pasir Ris station and the flooding incident in the tunnels between Bishan and Braddell stations.  Regarding the Pasir Ris accident, LTA said its investigation found that the SMRT work team failed to comply with operating procedures for access to the tracks during train service hours. \"These lapses were further compounded by inadequate supervision of MRT operations at the time of the accident,\" said LTA, adding that it intended to impose a financial penalty of S$400,000 on SMRT for breach of licence conditions arising from the procedural lapses.  The Mar 22, 2016 accident saw two SMRT trainees killed after being hit by an east-bound train on the railway tracks near Pasir Ris station as they were investigating a possible signalling fault between Tampines and Pasir Ris stations.  The accident also disrupted train services on both bounds of the East-West Line between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah stations, affecting about 16,500 commuters. SMRT was also convicted and fined under the Workplace Safety and Healthy Act (WSHA) for failing to take necessary measures to ensure the safety and health of employees at work, said LTA.  \"Following the incident, SMRT has carried out a review of its safety structures, processes and compliance, and has also accorded the highest attention and priority to safety,\" it added.  FLOODING BETWEEN BISHAN AND BRADDELL STATIONS Meanwhile, LTA said it also intends to impose a financial penalty on SMRT of S$1.5 million for the flooding accident that happened last year from Oct 7 to Oct 8, under Section 19 of the Rapid Transit Systems (RTS) Act. Investigations by LTA found that SMRT was fully responsible for the incident, as the incident was entirely preventable if the Bishan stormwater sump pit and its pumping system had been properly maintained. Last year's incident saw flooding in the North-South Line tunnels between Bishan and Braddell stations, which resulted in a cumulative disruption to regular train services of 14.5 hours between Ang Mo Kio and Newton stations.  The incident affected about 231,000 commuters. SMRT has apologised for the incident and has been open and transparent in reporting the falsification of records, which contributed to the incident, said LTA.  \"It has also carried out recovery works and implemented preventive measures at the Bishan stormwater sump pit and other tunnel portal pumping systems, in collaboration with LTA.\"  SMRT has also further strengthened its maintenance processes and supervisory checks, and also disciplined staff who neglected their duties, it added.  \"In assessing the penalty amount for each of the two incidents, LTA has considered all facts and the severity of the incidents,\" said the authority.  \"LTA will also consider any other mitigating facts which the operator may raise as part of the due process for the imposition of the financial penalties,\" it said, adding the financial penalties collected will go to the Public Transport Fund to help needy families with transport fares. Meanwhile, the collision at Joo Koon station was \"not due to actions by SMRT\", said LTA.  Investigations of the Nov 15 incident last year found that the root cause was a software logic issue with the new Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) system that had not been configured to cater for the failure conditions. \"COMMITTED TO PREVENT FUTURE INCIDENTS\" SMRT chairman Seah Moon Ming later released a statement saying that the company has \"implemented various measures and adopted Kaizen methodology\" in order to strengthen and enhance its systems, processes and staff management.  “We are sorry these incidents occurred. We are committed to doing all we can to prevent future incidents from happening,\" he said.  He added that SMRT has also been working closely with LTA to improve the reliability, maintainability and safety of the MRT network, as well as to enhance network resilience and robustness. \"In recent months, trains have been running more smoothly, providing better journeys to our commuters,\" he said. \"SMRT is fully committed to our mission of providing safe, secure and reliable services to commuters.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-fined-1-9-million-for-pasir-ris-fatal-accident-flooding-10547928"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 01:06PM", "tags": ["court", "accident"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Driver sentenced to one week’s jail for accident which led to maid being flung from his car", "content": " SINGAPORE: A driver who was in a traffic accident that led to his maid being thrown out of the car was sentenced to one week's jail on Friday (Jul 20).

That is the question faced by Malaysia’s economic affairs minister Mohamed Azmin Ali, who is leading a task force that will decide the fate of the High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, which the new government has claimed will cost RM110 billion (US$27 billion). Signed between Malaysia and Singapore government in December 2016, the 350km HSR project - linking Kuala Lumpur and Singapore - was slated to be operational by the end of 2026. But Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced he would scrap the project after the new Pakatan Harapan government was elected into power in May. Two months on, the Singapore Government has yet to be officially notified by their Malaysia counterparts. To date, about S$250 million have been spent by Singapore on the project.  Speaking to Channel NewsAsia on Thursday, Azmin acknowledged that the time has come to decide once and for all the status of the HSR project.  This comes after Mahathir hinted on Thursday that a deferment may be the only option, as unilateral cancellation was just going to be too costly. “We need to make a clear decision now. In the event we want to defer, the entire process needs to be reviewed; we can’t just slow it down, we have to either suspend it now or terminate it,” said Azmin. Azmin on Thursday said he plans to meet Singapore’s Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan before the end of the month to discuss the way forward. A JUST AND EQUITABLE SOLUTION Whatever the outcome, he assured, it will be just and equitable to both sides. While he is still trying to unbundle the whole process, Azmin said he understands that many parties were involved, from government bodies to multinational companies who took part in the international bidding. “There are so many packages. I need to know how many packages have been awarded and how many are still open to bidders, because the stakeholders are not government entities, they are also other international multinational companies,\" he said.  “We do appreciate they have incurred operating expenses in the last few months.\" But he declined to comment on the status of the tender process, especially for the train carriages and tracks that is scheduled to close on Dec 28. Azmin added that under the agreement, it is lawful for either party to want to terminate the agreement. Singapore, he said, is entitled to claim for compensation and there is a formula provided in the contract to work out the amount. “They have every right to put up their claims, we need to sit down and verify those claims,” he said.

Dr Balakrishnan said that being inter-dependent will only benefit the region's economies and usher in a golden age for the Indo-Pacific. \"We need to remove barriers to trade in goods, services and ideas. And that is why, in fact, at this time when there is a pushback against trade liberalisation in some of the more advanced parts of the world, it is all the more important for India and ASEAN to double down on the cause of free trade,\" he said. \"Specifically, we need to work towards the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and hopefully to do so by the end of this year.\" He added: “Given the headwinds that we currently face in the global trade environment, we are all better off together as one.  \"So we should move forward together and we must demonstrate that an inclusive and well-connected region remains the best approach for us to capitalise on our complementarities within India and ASEAN, in order to achieve growth, in order to achieve hope for our peoples.\" India is playing host to the 10th edition of the Delhi Dialogue, an annual event to discuss politico-security, economic and socio-cultural engagement between India and ASEAN.

She added that India supports security and growth for all in the region, regardless of size and strength. “We must follow a common, rules-based order that takes into account the equality of all, irrespective of size and strength. It should allow use of common spaces on sea and in the air,” said Ms Swaraj. She added, “Our vision of the Indo-Pacific, not only involves physical inter-connectivity, but also entails building bridges of trust, based on mutual respect, giving due regard for sovereignty and territorial integrity, consultation, transparency, viability and sustainability.” The term Indo-Pacific has gained new prominence recently with its repeated use by US President Donald Trump and other senior figures in his administration. Unlike the term Asia-Pacific, Indo-Pacific conveys a wider view of the region to include the Indian subcontinent.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-opposes-any-attempts-that-threaten-freedom-of-10546170"}, {"datetime": "20 Jul 2018 06:43AM", "tags": ["gender equality", "women", "business", "entrepreneuriship"], "author": "Genecia Alluora", "title": "Commentary: Overlooked and underpaid, women must speak up and put themselves out there", "content": " SINGAPORE: If there’s one piece of advice I could give to women everywhere, it’s to voice workplace concerns to their bosses and harbour more self-belief. Women across the world are failing to speak out, negotiate for themselves or make demands of their companies, out of fear of causing career chaos. Coupled with other structural factors that disadvantage women, this entrenches a labour market characterised by lower participation, higher unemployment and persistent wage gaps for women. What this also means is that there are less women at the decision-making table in corporations - with adverse impact for companies, sectors and entire economies where women are less represented. OVERLOOKED AND UNDERPAID According to the report launched by the Human Capital Leadership Institute and BoardAgender, women in Singapore occupy over just 10 percent of board seats despite making up nearly half the labour force. A report by the Ministry of Manpower also revealed that women in Singapore are on average paid at least 10 per cent less than men for doing the same job in most sectors. It is a two-way street we need to encourage. If we want more women to progress into leadership roles eventually, we need CEOs to support those voices and welcome feedback. Many women fail to speak out when they are overlooked for promotions and lack confidence to say whether they are actually happy in the workplace. Females who speak out and climb the ladder tend to be viewed as abrasive. By not speaking out, women are failing to avail of higher positions, yet equality is a necessity in the workplace. Women in Singapore are still seen as the heart of the household and are expected to carry out the majority of housework and be key childminders. This is despite figures from the Labour Force in Singapore Advance Release 2016 which demonstrate the employment rate for females aged 25 to 64 in 2016 was 80.3 percent. A DIFFERENT WORKPLACE Studies have shown that men and women experience workplace outcomes very differently, with men often securing more promotions, challenging assignments and having more access to top leaders, compared to women. Women on the other hand, rather unfairly tend to hit more stumbling blocks on their journey to the top of the career ladder – and most of them feel these obstacles keenly. Just look at figures from the Women in the Workplace 2017 report by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co. The study shows less than half of women feel the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees and believe that promotions are awarded fairly. A significant proportion of women also feel gender is to blame when it comes to missing those all important raises and promotions. More worryingly, even more women believe their gender will make it hard for them to advance in the future. This common fear which needs to be addressed is mainly felt by women at senior levels. SPEAK UP To address this common fear requires leadership to play a role. Time and time again, corporate leaders need to remind all around them that the workplace should not be a “his or hers” experience but rather an “us” occurrence – and all the more so when female representation at the top echelon of companies remains paltry. Although the Code of Corporate Governance in Singapore requires companies to consider diversity as part of board nomination processes, the number of women on boards of listed companies in Singapore in particular compared to other key markets remains extremely low. These concerning figures show no sign of increasing if women continue lacking confidence or harbouring dissatisfaction. It could only be for the greater good that more females make their mark in the workplace. When more women are given equal opportunities, whether to represent companies at the top or given access to resources to start their own, there are massive benefits for companies and the economy. Recent figures from Facebook indicate that having more female business leaders in Singapore could result in thousands of new opportunities. A Facebook study revealed that if 14 per cent of women who said they were “very likely” to start a business actually went through with it, 42,700 new businesses would be created in addition to 178,000 jobs by the end of 2021. Back to corporate leadership representation, other figures from the Women in the Workplace 2017 by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co report show that in today's workforce, women make up 46 per cent of a company’s entry-level group but only a handful, if any, make it to the C-Suite. Another study by the Wall Street Journal found that men are 30 per cent more likely than women to be promoted to management roles, and move up the ladder in larger numbers, with women holding under a quarter of senior leadership positions and less than one-fifth of C-suite roles. Might it be that women are taking rejection and the lack of progression up the corporate chain lightly? Do women really aspire less than men to rise to the top? I believe the issue lies in low awareness about the importance and benefits of gender diversity on boards and a lack of belief felt among women in their own abilities. COMPANY LEADERS MUST BE EDUCATED Another problematic issue is education for leadership - especially when so many business leaders claim women lack qualifications or requirements needed to assume directorship positions.  There is also this clouded perception that the pool of female talent at the top is limited due to women having children and raising families – and taking time away from work to meet their familial commitments. Of course we play important roles as wives and mothers but let’s get real, that shouldn’t mean our career clock stops ticking. The most ambitious, career-minded and capable of us will stop at nothing to get to the top. So a comfortable balance needs to be uncovered between male and female leaders, and opportunities to progress need to be given to both sexes. Globally, women have become more confident with greater awareness of the benefits of gender equality and as inequality in the workplace has rightly been brought under the spotlight. Inequality in the office is changing and we can continue to ensure it does so through putting ourselves forward and being more “out there”. Microsoft and Facebook are two prime examples of multinationals embracing female leaders through growing mentorship and training programmes. Microsoft has also developed a partnership with gender equality organisations like the Anita Borg Institute, to provide fellowships and bolster initiatives support women in technology. On our parts, by speaking out, women can signal that they do not accept a predetermined workplace fate based on gender and shape their organisations for the better. It’s time for women to embrace their talents and push for opportunities to progress.

While he appreciated the explanation behind Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Plant's losses and the company’s decision to seek court protection, the retiree wanted more updates on the divestment of the plant and what that means when the 4.25 per cent bonds that he had invested S$250,000 into mature this September. “There isn’t a conclusion and everything still hinges on the sale of Tuaspring and at what price. But my investment is due in September and that’s what I’m most concerned about,” he told Channel NewsAsia. “I’m retired so this was going to be a key part of my income but now, not just the income, I have to be worried about my capital. My kids are going to university soon so I have to figure another way out.”  Seen as one of Singapore’s most successful business stories, Hyflux made the unexpected move on May 22 to seek court protection for a reorganisation of its business and liabilities. The household name, which first made its mark in water treatment before venturing into the power market, cited “prolonged weakness” in the local power market for the turnabout in fortunes.  Trading in its SGX-listed shares and related securities has since been suspended, leaving tens of thousands of retail investors reeling. This includes 34,000 holders of its perpetual securities and preference shareholders, as well as 16,000 shareholders.  To address these concerns, Hyflux partnered investor advocacy group, Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS), to organise three townhall sessions. The first was held at Thursday noon for the noteholders, followed by a session at 7pm for holders of preference shares and perpetual securities. About 800 stakeholders registered for both sessions, according to SIAS. The evening session, in particular, was packed to the brim with about 600 investors. Another 155 ordinary shareholders will get their chance to quiz the management, including Hyflux founder-CEO Olivia Lum, at their session on Friday at 7pm.  SESSION \"QUITE CIVIL AND ORDERLY\" The company’s chief financial officer Lim Suat Wah said the townhall sessions will help investors understand the company’s current circumstances.  “We did an update on the company because we realised that a lot of the stakeholders may not sufficiently understand the business,” she told reporters after the first townhall session on Thursday.  “We also gave them a sense of what’s going to happen moving forward,\" added Ms Lim, who is also the group executive vice president. \"In terms of the restructuring plan, at this point, we do not have a plan to share.\" SIAS president David Gerald said the panel answered a slew of questions ranging from the losses in Tuaspring to the CEO’s salary. “Olivia and her team were forthcoming and frank in their responses,” Mr Gerald told Channel NewsAsia, while noting that the townhall meeting for noteholders “was quite civil and orderly”.  “There were no heated moments,” he added.  This was echoed by investors Channel NewsAsia spoke to who described the atmosphere as “grim”, “serious but cordial” and that questions came rapidly during the question-and-answer segment.  Given how this was Ms Lum’s first public appearance since the company’s unexpected move, some also said the founder was “well prepared” and came off as “sincere” after starting her speech with an apology.  “She performed well and I thought she was well prepared for the questions,” said Ms Teo.  Another noteholder told Channel NewsAsia that the session was “re-assuring” for him to some extent.  “For me, I wasn’t as updated as others before the meeting so I thought there was some new information today. It was also a bit reassuring to hear all these from the horse’s mouth, and in front of SIAS, their legal and financial advisors, and so many of us,” said the investor in his mid-60s, who preferred to remain anonymous.  “True, there were answers on Tuaspring that weren’t forthcoming but that’s because they didn’t even know who these prospective buyers were, which is fair enough,” he added.  Agreeing, Mr Martin Lee, who attended the evening townhall session, said that he did not have much expectations given that this was the company’s first such meeting with stakeholders.  “I didn’t expect any plans given that this is just the first session … How much money we can get back will depend on how much they can sell Tuaspring but since they don’t have a buyer nor a sale price, it’s not possible for them to give us any updates. They just don’t have the money,” he told Channel NewsAsia.  FORM STEERING COMMITTEE, MORE TOWNHALL SESSIONS TO COME: SIAS In between the sessions on Thursday, Ms Lum told reporters that Hyflux is working hard to keep the company afloat and to ensure fair treatment for all stakeholders, including retail investors. On the sale of the company’s single largest asset, Hyflux said there are eight bidders for Tuaspring at the moment, but the company has not received any “real firm offer”.  Meanwhile, though she wants the consent solicitation exercise to take place “as soon as possible”, it will take time to iron out the details given the big number of stakeholders and lenders that Hyflux has.  Moving forward, Mr Gerald from SIAS told Channel NewsAsia that the next step for stakeholders will be “to form a steering committee” and “appoint an independent legal advisor to help them understand the restructuring”.  He also added that there will be more townhall sessions to come. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-shareholders-townhall-meet-management-first-time-10545662"}, {"datetime": "19 Jul 2018 10:33PM", "tags": ["crime", "Singapore Police Force", "Singapore Civil Defence Force"], "author": "", "title": "Woman found dead with stab wounds at ITE campus car park in Ang Mo Kio", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 56-year-old woman was found dead after she was allegedly stabbed in a car park at ITE College Central in Ang Mo Kio on Thursday (Jul 19) night.

He added that while Singapore can take pride in what it has accomplished as a multicultural nation, it cannot take it for granted nor presume that the work is complete. \"Singapore has come a long way since independence in 1965, in strengthening the multi-racial fabric of our society,\" Mr Iswaran said in his opening address at a forum on Ethnic Identity and Culture, organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and OnePeople.sg (OPSG). \"Our progress has been paved by the far-sighted policies and efforts of our pioneers ... It is incumbent that we continue their good work, by nurturing our individual identities, strengthening social interactions and building more international linkages in this common effort,\" he added. Mr Iswaran said that Singapore’s ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) is a tangible demonstration of its commitment to the global effort to promote diversity and combat racism. On the local front, Mr Iswaran said, every Singaporean must be able to cultivate a sense of belonging that goes beyond his ethnic identity, and develop a deep and genuine interest in Singaporeans of different ethnicities. He also encouraged “greater social mixing between different ethnic and cultural groups” to help foster strong ties, regardless of race, language and religion. A survey conducted by Channel NewsAsia and the IPS on race relations in 2016 found that although more than 40 per cent of respondents held negative stereotypes about different races, the majority believed that people from all races should be treated equally. Mr Iswaran cited the “curry incident” in 2011, where an Indian family was urged to restrict their cooking of curry after receiving complaints from their Chinese neighbour, as an example of how inflammatory content can spread quickly on social media. On the other hand, Mr Iswaran said he is \"heartened\" by several youth-driven initiatives against discrimination, such as the SG Muslims for Eid programme, started by Interfaith Youth Circle (IYC). Under this programme, any guest, regardless of his religion, can visit the homes of Muslim hosts on the first day of Hari Raya, to directly experience Muslim customs. IYC is also looking to doing something similar for Christmas. \"Multiculturalism and meritocracy are the twin tenets upon which Singapore was founded ...

In her first media appearance since the home-grown water treatment specialist filed for court protection in May, Ms Lum, who is also the executive chairman of Hyflux, said: “Within this year, my hope and my goal is to always look after the shareholders and other stakeholders (so that) we can be fair to everybody.”  Referring to the more than 50,000 holders of the company’s perpetual securities, preference shares and common equities – in which many of them are mom-and-pop investors – she said: “They put their trust in me, in the company, to be able to bring returns to them and now we got into this trouble.  “We still have to work our extreme utmost to ensure that the company stays viable and we want to work towards a viable scheme so that everybody will be treated fairly.”  Flanked by two members of her senior management team, two non-executive independent directors, as well as financial and legal advisors from Ernst & Young Solutions (EY) and Wong Partnership at a conference room in the company’s headquarters, Ms Lum also revealed that Hyflux is in touch with eight bidders for its Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Plant and 19 interested parties for rescue financing. Seen as one of Singapore’s most successful business stories, Hyflux made the unexpected move on May 22 to apply for a court-supervised process to reorganise its business and liabilities. The household name, which first made its mark in water treatment before venturing into the power market, cited “prolonged weakness” in the local power market for the turnabout in fortunes.  Trading in its SGX-listed shares and related securities has since been suspended, leaving tens of thousands of retail investors reeling. Some analysts and investors that Channel NewsAsia spoke to noted that this has come as a shock given how the management had “gave an impression that they can pull through this” in February when it held its annual results briefing.  When asked about this, Hyflux’s top executives reiterated that the move to seek court protection, while shocking, was a “proactive step” to preserve its assets and protect value for stakeholders.  Chief financial officer Lim Suat Wah revealed that the idea of seeking court protection was not on the table even when the company reported further losses for the first quarter in early May. “In February, when we had our first year of operating loss, we started to see signs of electricity prices improving … hence in terms of signaling (of any issues), that didn’t come out in February,” she said. “In fact when we announced first-quarter results on May 5, there was no plan to file for any court protection.”  However, snowballing losses related to its single largest asset, Tuaspring, began to fuel concerns within its board. These were compounded by the lack of “serious bids” for the loss-making integrated plant that has been put up for sale since end-2016.  Concurrently, these losses have started to make some of the company’s lenders “more jittery” and become less supportive of its other ventures, said Ms Lum.  “The main trigger (for the moratorium) is really just the Tuaspring losses, which we have been transparent about for the last two years,\" explained Ms Lim, who is also the group executive vice president.  \"In our business, given that it’s very capital intensive, we have always been in a process of divesting and investing so divesting Tuaspring is a key process to inject capital into our business,\" she added. “On the board level, there was discussion about what if it took longer to sell Tuaspring? What if some projects that are under construction has any unexpected delay. What can management do to protect the company?\" 8 BIDDERS FOR TUASPRING, 19 PARTIES FOR RESCUE FINANCING Hyflux and four of its subsidiaries were granted a six-month reprieve from creditors by the High Court on Jun 19. Another subsidiary, Tuaspring, reached an agreement with secured creditor Maybank on Jul 6, in which Hyflux had until Oct 15 to “execute a binding agreement” for the sale of the Tuaspring integrated water and power plant.  On the sale of this crucial asset, Hyflux said it is in touch with a total of eight bidders at the moment though it has not gotten any “real firm offer”. On whether these bidders are local or foreign companies, its lawyers from WongPartnership would only say there is \"a good mix”.  Commenting on the prolonged process to find a buyer for its interest in the plant, Ms Lum noted that with Tuaspring being a strategic water asset in Singapore, approval from national water agency PUB was necessary “every step of the way”.  “Every name that even come to the door, even before doing paper due diligence, it has to be approved first. This process, of course, takes a long time. Some of them are overseas companies so the water agency has to know their background and who they are before allowing them.”  Ms Lum also shed light on how Hyflux decided on the project despite not having prior experience in the energy sector.  Noting that there were more opportunities for integrated water and power plants than pure desalination plants in markets like Middle East, she said: “I have always been very ambitious. If I can gain some experience in IWPP in home ground, perhaps that would help to propel us into the region.”  “That’s why we wanted to try out in our (home market) first in the form of Tuaspring,” said Ms Lum, while adding that this was a decision that was “well supported” by the independent advisors and bankers.  “(It’s) not that Olivia Lum decides to enter a IWPP project and let’s do it. This is a S$1.1 billion project and one that’s not to be taken lightly. We entered into this project purely because independent analysis of this project (said it would be) very viable.”  When asked by Channel NewsAsia how confident the management is of nailing down a binding agreement with a bidder by mid-October, Ms Lum replied: “We can’t control the timeline. There’s a deadline given in our consensus agreement but if let’s say more time (is needed) then we have to sit down with Maybank to re-negotiate again.”  Independent director Simon Tay added: “Some people think of it as a real ultimatum for the company ... but it’s equally good for the bidders. Now the date has been set, they have much more urgency.\" Describing this as a “relatively good positon to be in”, Mr Tay said: “We don’t want fire sale madness but a process that is transparent, with competitive bids and there is a clear deadline for everyone to work towards. I think this can surface rational price.”  Hyflux has also signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with 19 interested parties to seek rescue financing – a number that has exceeded the company’s expectations, according to EY Partner Glenn Peters.  He added that this remains in “early days” as the company looks to “reduce the size over the next few weeks to determine who’s the most serious of the parties”. HYFLUX \"STILL VERY VIABLE\" Before the media briefing on Thursday, Hyflux also held the first of three townhall meetings with its stakeholders. After the earlier session for noteholders, holders of Hyflux’s preference shares, perpetual securities and ordinary shares will have their meetings with the management at 7pm on Thursday and Friday.  A presentation slide regarding the reorganisation process was shown to noteholders at the earlier meeting, before a question-and-answer segment.  As for details of its consent solicitation exercise, Hyflux’s executives said the process has not been a “simple straight forward one” given the sheer size of its stakeholders and how it needs to first get the consent of its 29 creditors.  However, the company will be spearheading the process and details will be revealed in time, said Mr Manoj Sandrasegara, partner of WongPartnership.  “We have fair ideas what has to be done and we are looking at fresh rescue financing, maybe getting an investor in or a combination of two. In terms of timeline, we are in the process of speaking to many parties and at some point in time, we will get down to some specifics, whether it’s payment in full or there will be slight shortfall. Those terms will be discussed.”  “We have been given six months for the restructuring and we are confident that we can do it within that time,\" he said. Internally, Ms Lum said the company has not made any lay-offs despite its challenging circumstances, though there has been “some resignations”.  Given that the company still has three half-completed projects in places like Saudi Arabia, as well as a handful of new projects in Iran and Turkey, it still needs manpower.  “We still have so many projects lined up that we need to execute and protect. At the end of it, even when the whole restructuring is done, the business has to be viable,” she told reporters. “With the news out, you can imagine that some of the staff have been frightened that they may not have a job the next day. My job is to assure them whatever we do, we want to turn around this business and back to where we were again.”  Ms Lum said over the last few months, she has been reaching out to the company’s critical customers over the world. The founder noted that most of them remain “very supportive”. The new projects also indicate that Hyflux is “still very viable” and “still wanted” despite its current circumstances.  She added: “It is just one (project) that caused us to be like that but that doesn’t mean that we have lost our competitiveness. My job is to motivate the staff and let them see that after turning around, there's another good coming.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-working-hard-to-stay-viable-ensure-fair-treatment-to-10544956"}, {"datetime": "19 Jul 2018 07:25PM", "tags": ["Agri-food and Veterinary Authority", "Immigration and Checkpoints Authority", "animals", "wildlife", "Woodlands Checkpoint"], "author": "", "title": "2 men fined S$11,000 for possession of scorpion, importing leopard geckos", "content": " SINGAPORE: Two men were fined a combined S$11,000 for wildlife-related offences this week, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) announced on Thursday (Jul 19).  In a press release, AVA said that 27-year-old Muhammad Effendi Roslan was fined S$6,000 for the possession of an Indian star tortoise, a scorpion, a red-bellied short-necked turtle and two corn snakes.  AVA had received feedback from the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) in February last year about the alleged sale of illegal wildlife on online marketplace Carousell.

Water is state sovereignty. When it comes to religion, land and water, it belongs to the state. Therefore, I think it's the Johor state government (that) should decide.

FERRY TRANSPORTATION AND THIRD CAUSEWAY TO EASE CONGESTION  Tunku Ismail also suggested possible solutions to reduce congestion at the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link - land border points used by hundreds of thousands of commuters every day. He said that water transportation, or moving people by ferries, is “very, very important” as it is very accessible to the state.  “It’s my personal opinion that if you have a third Causeway, it will better alleviate any (road) congestion between Johor and Singapore.

Keppel, whose businesses range from rig-building to property development, posted a net profit of S$246 million for the quarter ended June, versus S$171 million a year ago. Total revenue for the quarter was S$1.52 billion, slightly lower than the S$1.55 billion posted a year ago. Profit at the company's property division rose 132 per cent to S$225 million, helped by en bloc sales in some development projects and a fair value gain. Its offshore and marine (O&M) division, which builds drilling rigs and support vessels, posted a loss of S$17 million versus a S$11 million profit last year. Keppel said the division's order book stood at S$4.6 billion at end-June, excluding orders from Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, a Brazilian client that filed for bankruptcy protection. Orders in some segments of its O&M business such as liquefied natural gas-powered vessels have been slowly picking up after slumping for two years on lower oil prices and a glut of rigs.

Mr Masagos presented Singapore's voluntary national review at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF) in New York on Thursday. \"Singapore pursued sustainable development even before the term became fashionable,\" he said.  \"Since independence, we have tried balancing environmental considerations with economic development, believing that the two are complementary, not contradictory.\" In a Facebook post about his speech, the minister said he spoke on the progress Singapore had made in its \"unwavering pursuit\" of sustainable development. Said Mr Masagos: \"Our path of sustainable development was not without challenges, and these achievements are testament to the strong collaborative partnerships built between our Government, industries and people, as well as Singapore’s firm belief in building a clean and green city that we can call home. \"But we will continue to work hard to improve the well-being of our people.\" The HLPF is a global forum for providing political leadership, guidance and recommendations on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - a commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030 worldwide - and its 17 sustainable development goals. At the forum, 47 countries, including Singapore, presented their voluntary national reviews over three days of ministerial meetings from Jul 16 to 18. Presenting Singapore's review, Mr Masagos highlighted the importance of \"collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships\", saying that in the first  half of 2018 - Singapore's Year of Climate Action - close to a quarter of a million Singaporeans, corporations and civil society organisations have pledged to save energy and water, practise recycling and fight climate change.  \"Partnerships are key to sustainability,\" said the minister. \"For a decade, Singapore has been hosting the World Cities Summit, Singapore International Water Week and Clean-Enviro Summit Singapore to share and co-create solutions for urban sustainability.\" As Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore also convened the Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action last week, said Mr Masagos. Together with key partners, it reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement and regional action to tackle climate change.  The minister also gave an overview of Singapore's progress in implementing the sustainable development goals. Firstly he spoke about the issue of water resilience. Pointing out that the World Resources Institute ranks Singapore as the country most at risk of water stress by 2040, Mr Masagos highlighted features such as Singapore's national water recycling system that transforms wastewater into reclaimed NEWater, as well as the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System that collects and transports wastewater. This will be extended by 100km by 2025 to transport and turn more wastewater into NEWater for industrial use and domestic consumption, said Mr Masagos. He also spoke about Singapore's implementation of the Carbon Tax, which he said would \"incentivise emissions reduction and encourage companies to transit to a low-carbon future\". Pointing out that 95 per cent of Singapore's electricity is generated from natural gas, Mr Masagos said that the country was also \"aggressively developing solar energy\", installing solar panels on the roofs of public housing blocks and launching the world's largest floating solar photovoltaic test-bed. Mr Masagos also spoke about other initiatives including the Tuas Nexus wastewater treatment and solid waste management site and sustainable urban environment planning including Punggol New Town.

Negotiations on the CPTPP were concluded on Jan 23, 2018, in Tokyo and the agreement was subsequently signed on Mar 8 in Santiago, Chile.

The accused, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, was at his 25th birthday party at D'Resort in Downtown East on Jul 30, 2016.  The victim, then 23, was one of the guests at the surprise birthday party organised by the family of the accused. She arrived with her boyfriend at around 6pm to 6.30pm and went to the barbecue pit, where they mingled with the family members of the accused. The victim drank three mixed vodka-orange drinks and a cup of wine over the course of the night and felt \"tipsy and sleepy\" at about 10pm, court documents said. About an hour later, her boyfriend took her upstairs to one of the chalet rooms to rest. There were other people in the room. HE MOLESTED HER WHILE SHE WAS SLEEPING While she was drifting in and out of sleep, she heard the voices of the accused and the accused's father, and saw the accused sitting on the side of the bed. When she was half-asleep, she felt the accused molesting her under her shirt, but did not react as she thought it was her boyfriend. The accused then molested her over her underwear before pulling it down. She pulled up her clothes but did not turn, as she still thought it was her boyfriend. The accused then pulled down her bottoms and rubbed himself against her. The victim woke fully when she felt something wet, and saw the accused walking to the toilet. She went to the toilet and saw the accused inside masturbating. When he exited the toilet, the victim asked him what he had done to her. He replied \"nothing\" and left. At this point, the victim saw that three of the accused's siblings were in the room, along with his father, but all were sound asleep. The victim went to the toilet to wash away the fluid and went downstairs to look for her boyfriend. She felt outraged and distressed by the incident, and said she had viewed him like an older brother before the offence, investigations later revealed. POLICE AT THE SCENE FOR UNRELATED DISPUTE ARREST THE ACCUSED Police had arrived for an unrelated quarrel among a group of people at about 3.45am, but when they saw the victim crying, they asked her what happened. The victim said she had been molested. She then fainted and was taken to hospital, while the accused was later arrested. Forensic examinations found the accused's DNA on the victim's panties, as well as the accused's semen on the bedsheet. The prosecution initially called for a sentence of 20 months' jail, with caning, but later reduced this to 18 months' jail, with four strokes of the cane, after taking into consideration the accused's plea of guilt. He had pleaded guilty last month to one charge of assault or use of criminal force with intent to outrage modesty. On Wednesday (Jul 18), the defence asked for a sentence of between six and eight months' jail, saying that the accused had spared the victim the trauma of a trial and extensive cross-examination. He added that the accused's mother had run away and has not been in Singapore for the last five years, while his father had a heart attack and went for heart surgery. \"He and his siblings united to help,\" said the defence. \"He pleads for the minimum sentence possible, because there's still a chance for reformation. He has been very good to his family. He still wants to look after his siblings.\" The defence added that \"at all times, the victim thought it was her boyfriend who was having contact with her\". He said: \"Is there distress? Is there harm?\"  VICTIM WAS VIOLATED IN THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE SHE TRUSTED: JUDGE In response, District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam said: \"Yeah, but if it had been the boyfriend, there would be consent.\" He added that the accused had been taking advantage of the victim being tipsy, and that the victim was in the company of people she trusted. \"Instead of being safe, she was violated,\" said the judge. Sentencing the accused to 18 months' jail and four strokes of the cane, the judge said that there was a betrayal of trust, and that the accused took advantage of the victim's state. He also noted that there was denial when the accused was confronted at the scene. \"The harm caused to the victim cannot be trivialised,\" said the judge. \"Caning in this case is warranted.\" He added that the accused, who has an asthmatic condition, would be examined by a medical officer in prison. If found unfit for caning, the case would be sent back to the judge. For assaulting or using criminal force with intent to outrage modesty, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of the three penalties.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-molested-sister-s-friend-at-own-birthday-party-in-10540268"}, {"datetime": "19 Jul 2018 11:33AM", "tags": ["High-Speed Rail", "Malaysia", "Mahathir Mohamad"], "author": "Sumisha Naidu", "title": "Malaysia to negotiate deferment of High-Speed Rail with Singapore: Mahathir", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said his government will look to negotiate with Singapore the deferment of the High-Speed Rail (HSR) project.

Fong pleaded guilty to the charges for offences under section 175 and 197 of the Companies Act, including failing to hold the annual general meeting (AGM) and failing to file annual returns (AR) in relation to 19 companies. Fong had been convicted in 2014 for similar offences and compounded 60 similar offences, said ACRA. A further 78 charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, and he was convicted and fined in the State Courts on Tuesday.

Two of the five directors were given a fine of $1,800 per charge, which the authority said was above the range of $800 to $1,200 per charge usually meted out for such offences. Fong and the other five directors will also be disqualified as directors of the companies to which they have been appointed, said ACRA.  The authority disqualifies directors who have been convicted of three or more filing related offences under the Companies Act within a period of five years, or had three or more companies struck off the register by ACRA within a period of five years. Once disqualified, an individual will not be allowed to be a company director or take part in the management of any local or foreign company for five years, effective from the date of the conviction.   These disqualified directors cannot take on any new appointment as a director, or be in any way directly or indirectly concerned or take part in the management of a company. “ACRA takes a serious view of offenders who persistently fail to comply and hold AGM and file AR on time,\" said Mr Andy Sim, ACRA's assistant chief executive (legal services and compliance).  \"The high fine that the Courts are prepared to impose reinforces our view on the importance of directors complying with their statutory obligations, and we will continue to hold directors to account and press for high fines in egregious cases.” Echoing his remarks, ACRA in its media release said that the holding of AGM and filing of AR were \"important statutory requirements\". \"The AGM provides a forum for shareholders to be informed of the financial position of the company and to engage the directors of the company on the matter,\" said the authority. \"Filing annual returns on time enables timely public disclosure of key information such as the health and status of the company.\" DISQUALIFIED DIRECTORS' STATUS TO BE PUBLISHED ON ACRA REGISTER In addition, ACRA said it would publish all directors who have been disqualified from acting as directors on its public register, with effect from Jul 25.

Speaking at the opening of Australian logistics company Toll Group’s S$228 million logistics hub, Mr Chan said he wants to make this a thing of the past, but that requires all logistics firms to continue innovating and to utilise their resources more effectively. “What we have today – automated vehicles picking items from the shelves and loading them onto the trucks – is just one part of our innovation in the entire supply chain,\" said the minister.  “I have a dream where all the things in the warehouse are organised overnight in the dark – picked, packed and delivered in the night to all the destinations, without holding up the traffic or fighting with the daytime logistics flow. That is how smart urban cities should look like,\" he added.  Mr Chan said this is why Singapore needs to testbed new concepts on this front, and build it into a competitive advantage. This way, Singapore can also be a role model and a testbed for many other countries, particularly in Asia. He cited Toll Group as one of the firms that is contributing to this vision of improving Singapore’s logistics and supply chains, and which has successfully done away with labour-intensive operations through the help of automation and digitalisation. For instance, automated guided vehicles and smart shelving systems at its new hub have helped Toll Group reduce manpower costs and ramp up its efficiency by up to 30 per cent. The company is also constantly working on new solutions that will help to maximise the usage of space in its warehouses. When asked if the use of automated equipment has displaced jobs, Toll Group’s executive vice president for global logistics, Mr Vincent Phang, told Channel NewsAsia that, on the contrary, it presents the company and its workforce with new opportunities. Mr Phang said: \"If anything, the opportunity for us to automate allows us to create new and better jobs for our workforce.  \"From an operator standpoint, it no longer is just about operating a single forklift, it could be that such an operator is operating a fleet of forklifts or being a supply chain planner, so that gives us the opportunity to upskill our talent and to create more meaningful jobs for them.\" He said the firm is able to ensure a healthy pipeline of talent through the government's Professional Conversion Programme, as well as working closely with polytechnics to attract its graduates into the industry.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-logistics-firms-urged-to-automate-adopt-new-technology-10541604"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 08:21PM", "tags": ["autism", "education", "schools", "Denise Phua"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Social enterprise cafe Professor Brawn opens at Raffles Institution ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Autism Resource Centre (ARC) has opened its first social enterprise cafe, Professor Brawn Cafe, in a school. The outlet, which is located at Raffles Institution (RI), was officially opened by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday (Jul 18). The cafe provides job opportunities for the special needs community and gives them a platform to showcase their talents and abilities. Under a partnership with Gong Cha, it also offers a selection of drinks from the popular bubble tea brand’s menu. Five of the cafe’s 10 employees have special needs, and are paid competitively based on their job scope. ARC’s deputy executive director Jacelyn Lim said that the centre's main intention in setting up the cafe is to drive the message of inclusion and create jobs for those with special needs. “They get to learn skills, apply their skills and be productively employed,” she said. “Second, there is also dignity – work is dignity, and that’s very important. It also gives them financial independence.” Professor Brawn Cafe was first founded in 2009 by Mr Roland Tay and his wife, ARC President and Member of Parliament Denise Phua. However, in the middle of this year, the couple decided to donate the brand to ARC, as it has the job coaching expertise and network to expand it to benefit more people. With the change, the brand closed its two outlets located at Novena and Boat Quay. The cafe at RI is the first to reopen under ARC’s management.  CAFE SHOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE INCLUSIVE: ONG YE KUNG Speaking at the opening of the cafe, Mr Ong pointed out that the model is an illustration of what it is like to be inclusive. “You see a delicate, artistic and careful balance,” he said. “On the one hand, there’s a lot of inclusiveness because they’re in the middle of a mainstream school, where students will get to be served by them and interact with them.” “But on the other hand, this is also a sanctuary, where they feel safe, and where people know what kind of cafe it is and calibrate their expectations,” he added. “So it’s about striking a balance. And that’s important for the education system as well.” WHY SET UP IN A SCHOOL?  There are obvious benefits to setting up the cafe in the school, with ARC’s Ms Lim explaining that it gives them affordable rental and a “captive crowd”. Previously, she said, the cafe functioned on a “typical commercial model”, with high overheads. Ms Phua, who is also chair of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education, said she has observed that in some schools, volunteer work or community involvement is not done on a daily basis. “It’s usually done once a year, or once a term,” she said. “So having this inclusive workforce, in a mainstream setting, where the students are actively involved and engaged, is really a more effective way of involving the community in supporting them.” She added that the RI students have helped with food tastings, publicity and even co-creating menus for the cafe. RI, she also pointed out, has been one of their earliest partners, and it was “by chance” that the school happened to have a space for them to set up the cafe after a previous tenant vacated. Since the cafe opened for business at the start of the month, Year 5 RI student Rowena Chua has visited “multiple times”. “I think by now, the entire school community has visited the café,” she said, describing her experience as “the same as at any other restaurant or café.” “When we go there, we know we’re interacting with a group of people who are slightly different, so I take a bit of caution when I interact with them,” she said. “But there’s no need to possess any stereotypes or harbour any misunderstandings about them.” “Because after a while, you get to know them, and you realise they’re pretty much the same as us.” Moving forward, ARC also hopes to replicate their model in other places, and Ms Lim stressed that they are not limiting themselves to operating only in schools.  “Ultimately, it’s about the message of inclusion, and that’s not confined to schools.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/social-enterprise-cafe-professor-brawn-opens-at-raffles-10541438"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 08:11PM", "tags": ["national service", "Singapore", "ben davis"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "Ben Davis’ father: It’s ‘unfortunate’ that MINDEF thinks my son would not return to serve NS", "content": " SINGAPORE: Harvey Davis, the father of Singaporean footballer Ben Davis, said in a statement on Wednesday (Jun 18) that it is \"unfortunate\" that the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has an impression that his son would not return to Singapore to serve his National Service (NS).

It also said the teenager's actions were meant to \"further his own professional career, not national interest\". \"There are a lot of variables all dependent on his development and progression, and anyone who understands how professional football and sports works will understand this,\" Mr Davis said in a media statement. \"In my discussions with SportSG and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), I was clear that Ben should do his NS but the question is just when,\" he added. \"This point was reiterated in an email response which was sent to MCCY on May 15.

To be honest, we are still processing the news.\" He added: “We are (operationally) about two years old. We said to each other, if we can get the Bib Gourmand award, then Muthu’s Curry ought to get the Michelin Star! They deserve it, having been around for decades.\"  There’s no star just yet for the popular Indian restaurant but Muthu’s Currinary chief executive officer Kasivishvanaath Ayyakkannu is still pleased with the accolade – even if he wasn’t aware it was happening at all. “We are so happy and quite shocked,” he told CNA Lifestyle. “It was never the intention to get on the list, so we will continue doing what we’ve always been doing, improve where we can and see how it goes”.  The two local food establishments were among the 17 new entrants into the 50-strong list that were recognised by Michelin inspectors this year. The Bib Gourmand is given to establishments with quality food priced at no more than S$45, and a lead-up to next week’s big event, when this year’s Michelin Guide Singapore will be announced. The Coconut Club’s owners attributed their success to having a great team of service staff. “We invest a lot in local human resource. We believe service is very important to the whole experience,” said Lee Chan Wai. What’s next for the restaurant? There are plans to expand their current space, as well as a menu update – plans made way before the Bib Gourmand announcements. “We were discussing about evolving our menu and perhaps adding burung puyuh (Malay for quail) for some time already. We hope people will not think we’re making all these changes simply because of the award!” quipped Lee Eng Su. For one of The Coconut Club’s regular patrons, 40-year-old Is, it’s a well-deserved award – even if he admitted that his first thought was “Oh no, that means the queue will get longer”. That won’t be an issue for Srinivasan Ayyakannu, director of operations for Muthu’s Currinary, the parent company of Muthu’s Curry. “Hopefully it translates to sales,” he quipped. “We’ve been here for 50 years, and this Race Course Road restaurant is our flagship. Most of our old customers and regulars usually patronise this outlet so that could be one of the reasons why this is the one that got the award”. Added Kasivishvannath: “Now that we have the award, we have to maintain the same standard, the food quality, the service and the prices,” he said. For the last 20 years, loyal Muthu’s Curry fan and Malaysian restauranteur and marketing consultant Shankar Santhiram has been dropping by whenever he’s in town – and he’s surprised the recognition took this long. “Muthu’s Curry is the real deal. And I would love to see them win more awards and accolades,” he said. “But like any genuine well-wisher, I’m also selfish because I don’t want the place to be jammed up. I hope that the owners of Muthu’s Curry stay true to form and not make the mistake of other restaurants by tweaking stuff once they win an award. You don’t have to up the ante or be all fancy. Just stay true to the old dude who started it years and years ago.” Continuity is also at the heart of Tai Wah Pork Noodle, another new Bib Gourmand entrant located at Hong Lim Market and Food Centre. If you find the name familiar, it’s because semi-retired hawker 64-year-old Tang Chai Chye used to run Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle with his elder brother Chay Seng at Marina Square. That store then moved to its current Crawford Lane location and has since been awarded the coveted Michelin Star. The Hong Lim Market and Food Centre stall is now being run by Chai Chye’s sons Gerald and Jason who are 38 and 30, respectively. And like the other new awardees, the elder Tang said he did not expect the accolade at all. “Although this news is good for us, it might not be seen as good for my regular customers,” he joked, in Mandarin. “Most of them are the office crowd who can’t queue for too long because they have to go back to the office.”   ​​Tang, who started in the business when he was 20 years old and fresh out of the army, says it’s important to keep the business in the family, whether they get awards or not. “If we ever sell it, then my late father would be very angry,” he said. “My sons don’t need to learn how to make the noodles. They’ve been helping out since they were in primary school.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/singapore-michelin-award-muthus-curry-coconut-club-tai-wah-10541266"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 07:53PM", "tags": [], "author": "Wendy Wong", "title": "Skills framework launched for food manufacturing industry", "content": " SINGAPORE: A skills framework for the food manufacturing industry was launched on Wednesday (Jul 18), as part of the sector’s industry transformation map.

Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday also witnessed the signing of the research collaboration agreement between NUS president Tan Eng Chye and Grab CEO Anthony Tan. Located at the Innovation 4.0 building in NUS, the lab will use data from Grab’s platform – said to have facilitated more than two billion rides – to solve “complex, real-world challenges in Southeast Asia” such as mapping out traffic patterns and identifying ways to impact mobility and liveability in this region, they said. The lab, which will be home to 28 researchers working on various AI projects, will focus on improving the efficiency and reliability of transportation on the Grab platform in Southeast Asia’s cities first, before expanding to research larger challenges such as congestion and liveability. The research includes developing algorithms to “match drivers to the jobs they prefer and improve driving safety through better understanding of driver behaviour”. Researchers will also work on improving \"precision and accuracy in mapping pick-up points and localising moving vehicles to help passengers and drivers get from point to point with greater ease and efficiency\", the press release stated. Grab's Mr Tan shared that its data, for example, shows that travel time from Newton to Tanjong Pagar can be “drastically improved”. “If this route would be better served by more shared transport solutions such as buses, trains, GrabShuttle, GrabShare or GrabHitch, we could bring travel time during peak hour down by one-third or from 40 minutes to 28 minutes,” the CEO said. The lab will also contribute to the development of AI talent through the training of PhD students who will be enrolled at the university, they added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/nus-grab-invest-s-6m-in-ai-lab-for-solving-urban-issues-like-10540918"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 05:16PM", "tags": ["court", "accidents"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Lorry driver who hit elderly man in fatal accident jailed, banned from driving", "content": " SINGAPORE: A delivery driver who ran over an elderly man in an accident outside Bugis+ last year was jailed for four weeks and banned from driving for five years on Wednesday (Jul 18).

Such a business arrangement was brought into the spotlight over the weekend when FTI Consulting, the provisional liquidators for bike-sharing company oBike, shared that the latter’s mobile app is not under the control of oBike Singapore – the entity currently going through the liquidation process. Drew & Napier director Lim Chong Kin said in his email that there is no general prohibition against providing on-demand services that collect deposits as well as user and payment data via an app that is not owned or controlled by a Singapore-registered entity. That said, Mr Lim pointed out that such apps continue to be subject to the laws in place, such as consumer protection laws and the Personal Data Protection Act, where applicable. The laws vary depending on the nature and functions of the app in question. “Whilst it would be tempting to view this as a loophole to be closed, I would view this more as a balance that needs to be constantly recalibrated in light of the societal concerns at stake,” said the lawyer. Another lawyer, Mr Bryan Tan, concurred saying that companies are free to make arrangements for how deposits are collected, provided it is clear to the consumer. Singapore law still applies to non-Singapore entities as they are dealing with data from consumers here, “although it would be more difficult to chase a non-Singapore entity”, the Pinsent Masons partner added.   FTI Consulting had told Channel NewsAsia over the weekend that the app is owned by and under the control of a separate overseas entity within the oBike Group, which the provisional liquidators have no control over or rights in relation to the operation of the app. “As such, the provisional liquidators are presently unable to process any refunds (if any), through the app,” it said.  Consumers in Singapore had asked why the bike-sharing company cannot refund the deposits collected via the oBike mobile app, similar to what another service provider Mobike did. As for whether similar situations currently seen with oBike may happen with other on-demand services that exit the local market, Mr Lim said this really depends on the terms and conditions of that company, its organisational structure and internal arrangements with regards to user deposits. “The foreign ownership of the app is unlikely to be determinative,” he said. With the Land Transport Authority (LTA) currently studying the need for bicycle-sharing operators to place a security deposit or performance bond should they require consumers to place deposits, this may also help avert to some extent a similar messy market exit, the Drew & Napier lawyer said. “In such a case, users of such apps can be assured of the return of at least a part of, if not all, their deposit monies,” Mr Lim said. Ms Anne Petterd, principal at Baker Mckenzie Wong & Leow, added that the new licensing regime for bike-sharing services may lessen the risk of consumers of such services losing their money in similar circumstances again.  As for whether the government determines that similar intervention is warranted for other \"disruptor-type service offerings\", Ms Petterd said it is a \"watch this space area\".  Drew & Napier's Lim cautioned consumers here to take steps to safeguard their own interests. For instance, it is a good practice to read the terms and conditions before signing up for such apps and consenting to their data collection. Users should also be mindful of whom they disclose their personal data and payment details to given their importance, and these should be disclosed only to trusted parties, the lawyer added. “Ultimately, it has to be caveat emptor – let the buyer beware.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-loopholes-to-close-but-more-can-be-done-to-prevent-another-10540696"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 03:04PM", "tags": ["oBike", "ofo"], "author": "", "title": "16-year-old boy assisting police with investigation of youth tossing oBike, ofo bikes into river", "content": " SINGAPORE: Police confirmed on Wednesday (Jul 18) that a 16-year-old boy was assisting them with investigations after video clips of a young man throwing oBike and ofo bicycles into a river went viral online.  The youth, who was wearing an orange T-shirt and black shorts while smoking a cigarette, was first seen throwing an ofo bicycle from a bridge into the river in an Instagram story clip.

Under the Biophilic Town Framework, all new precincts will be developed with the aim of allowing residents to connect better with nature, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on Wednesday (Jul 18). “(The framework) provides a strong foundation for holistic planning and design of neighbourhood landscapes, so that our residents can enjoy a strong sense of place and well-being,” HDB CEO Cheong Koon Hean said in a speech at the International Federation of Landscape Architects World Congress. The framework, which was first developed in 2013, comprises five key elements of the neighbourhood landscape - soil, flora and fauna, outdoor comfort, water and people. Town planners and architects will take into consideration several guiding principles when planning and designing precincts. This includes planting trees which are more effective at providing shade and absorbing heat, and constructing vegetated bioswales to treat rainwater runoff naturally. Biodiversity surveys will also be conducted before construction to study existing natural habitats, and new habitats such as dragonfly ponds, bird sanctuaries and butterfly gardens built to attract diverse species. National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who was present at the event, also stressed the importance of nature-centric design in light of rapid urbanisation worldwide. “It’s easy for cities to neglect their greenery and natural assets. We’ve seen this time and again - trees are cut down and removed, rivers are abused and covered over. “The result is that we end up with a harsh concrete jungle, and a living environment that is stressful and alienating for all,” said Mr Wong. “So we have to change our mindsets - don’t think about urban areas as being separate from nature, but reimagine cities as being part of our natural ecosystem, and coexisting in harmony with nature.” Punggol Northshore was the first nature-centric district when its first HDB project was launched in 2015.

Under its digitalisation masterplan, which was unveiled at the International Federation of Landscape Architects World Congress (IFLA) on Wednesday (Jul 18), NParks said it will focus on leveraging technologies to improve three main areas – arboriculture, horticulture and nature conservation and biodiversity management. To improve the inspection and management of the 2 million trees under its purview, the agency is currently piloting an electronic sensor that can detect early signs of structural instability in trees. This could help identify potential tree failures earlier so that measures can be taken. To allow more timely interventions, the agency is also currently working with various researchers to make use of data models and environmental sensor data for tree analytics.  One such project is a model that will allow NParks to study the impact of environmental conditions, such as wind on a tree's stability.  Called the Finite Element Model, it can estimate how force is needed to break or uproot the tree. This will provide arborists with an additional tool to determine maintenance needs of a tree.  To improve its efficiency in nursery management processes, NParks is piloting a smart irrigation system that can automatically trigger the watering of plants during dry weather conditions.  It is also testing an RFID inventory system to consolidate information such as species name and location on all plants in its nurseries. This will allow NParks to track how the plants have been distributed more efficiently.  Finally, to coordinate and strengthen nature conservation efforts, NParks is currently developing a prototype system that can detect forest fires and automatically activate a drone to provide real-time information of a fire.  Called the Forest Fire Detection System, digital cameras will be installed at various locations to provide continuous monitoring of Singapore's nature reserves.  At the same time, statistical modelling techniques are also being used to better understand ecosystems.  This includes hydrology modelling which will be used to study the impact of changing climate conditions on the Nee Soon Swamp Forest as well as an agent-based modelling to determine marine organism movements in coastal waters.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nparks-unveils-smart-roadmap-to-improve-efficiency-in-tree-10540156"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 11:00AM", "tags": ["digitalisation"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Easy-to-use plan to help security firms adopt technology for routine, manpower-heavy tasks", "content": " SINGAPORE: Local security agency firms can tap on a new plan that outlines clear roadmaps to help them adopt digital technology in their work, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo announced at its launch on Wednesday (Jul 18).  The Security Industry Digital Plan (IDP), developed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in partnership with the Ministry of Home Affairs, identifies a list of technology solutions at different stages of their development. It is a part of the security Industry Transformation Map announced in February. For instance, firms that have barely implemented any technological solutions will start in the first stage of the roadmap. It includes basic technology such as automated visitor management systems, mobile-enabled patrol and incident management systems, and surveillance cameras with analytics.  Mr Kenny Ng, a senior security supervisor at a condominium which has adopted technology into its security measures, said that his job has been made easier with surveillance cameras.  “It’s 12-hour [work] so, with this technology, it has made our job easier. We just monitor our cameras on the screen … Previously we have to chase [after] the vehicles and record the vehicles. Now our vehicle plate recognition camera will allow vehicles to enter and exit smoothly and records are automatically updated in the smart database,” said Mr Ng.  For security agencies that are more advanced in technology adoption, the roadmaps suggest cluster guarding, robotics, artificial intelligence and immersive media to beef up existing digital technology strategies.  SMEs can use an online self-assessment checklist to rate their digital readiness and identify digitalisation opportunities.  To encourage local security agencies to adopt pre-approved solutions identified in the roadmap, Enterprise Singapore will set aside S$7 million through the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG). There are seven pre-approved solution packages available, with more in the pipeline.  The pre-approved solutions, selected by MHA and IMDA, have been proven, market-tested and are cost-effective, said Mrs Teo. It will reduce the effort needed by firms to find their own solutions and give them a peace of mind that the vendor is reliable, she added.  PSG will help support 50 per cent of qualifying costs, capped at S$30,000 per security agency per year. A majority of security SMEs are eligible for the grant. A guide for an “Outcome-Based Security Contract” as a “necessary first step” to guide service buyers in adopting contracts based on outcomes, as opposed to fixed headcount was also launched. The guide includes principles and templates for service buyers to adopt such contracts at every stage of the tender process.  Mrs Teo said that many security agencies in Singapore have not adopted any technology in their work, and about 30 per cent of firms have adopted one technological update in their work. “With these pre-approved digital solutions and support available through PSG, we aim to double the number of security agencies that adopt at least one of these three pre-approved digital solutions by 2020 ... Certainly, by 2025, these basic building blocks should be the norm and no longer the exception,” she added.  TRAINING THE INDUSTRY’S WORKFORCE The IDP also includes a roadmap on training to prepare the security industry’s workforce with the necessary mindset and skills to adopt and benefit from technology.  Developed with SkillsFuture Singapore and the Security Industry Institute, the training is aligned with the Skills Framework for Security.   Raj Joshua Thomas, president of Security Association of Singapore, said that the plan can help alleviate manpower issues in the industry.  “At any one point of time, we have a shortage of security officers so we are helping to right-size the industry with technology. If we have to deploy less people, the shortage will just become lower and lower, and negated. So, I think we should not worry about officers being replaced by technology because structurally there is already a shortage,” Mr Thomas told Channel NewsAsia.  “The image that people have of the industry will also change because previously, people think it’s a jaga (caretaker) job but it, in fact, has already moved up to something of a higher value,” he added.  SMEs that require more help in reviewing their business can approach the SME Digital Tech Hub for business advisors or specialists for more advance digital solutions. These consultancy services are provided free-of-charge.  It is the fourth IDP launched to guide SMEs on their digital transformation efforts. Previously, similar IDPs were launched for the environmental services, logistics and retail sectors.  A Technical Reference (TR) for video analytics systems was also announced at the launch. The TR sets requirements and specifications for the selection, installation, operation, maintenance and data interoperability of video analytics systems.  The TR, which will be ready by end of next year, will help buyers assess the effectiveness of systems. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/easy-to-use-plan-to-help-security-firms-adopt-technology-for-10539972"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 09:14AM", "tags": ["Koufu", "stocks", "initial public offering", "Singapore Exchange"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Koufu serves up lukewarm trading debut after giving up gains to end flat at IPO price", "content": " SINGAPORE: Home-grown food court operator Koufu fizzled in its trading debut on the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) mainboard on Wednesday (Jul 18), closing flat at its initial public offering (IPO) price of S$0.63 apiece.  The counter got off to a good start with an opening price of S$0.65, but soon lost momentum after hitting an intra-day high of S$0.66 and gave up gains to end its first trading session at S$0.63.  It was among the most actively traded stocks for the day with about 34 million shares changing hands. The broader Straits Times Index (STI) also pared earlier gains to finish little moved at 3,240.50, up just 0.03 per cent or 0.86 points. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers by 189 to 182. With a market capitalisation of about S$350 million, Koufu will boost SGX’s consumer cluster to a total of 152 listings with a combined market capitalisation of more than S$135 billion, the bourse operator said in a news release. Mr Simon Lim, SGX’s head of equity capital market for sectors, said this will “provide investors with the opportunity to invest in one of Singapore’s most established household F&B brands”. \"We are excited to be the Group’s choice listing platform as it seeks to strengthen its presence in Singapore and overseas, drive productivity through innovation and automation, as well as expand into the online food ordering and delivery space,\" he added. Founder-CEO Pang Lim described the listing as a “strong vote of confidence” for the 16-year-old company, as well as a “recognition” of its track record and growth plans. Koufu said it received “strong support” from both institutional and retail investors at the close of its IPO on Monday noon.  The public tranche of 6.3 million shares was 17 times subscribed, with application monies of about S$67.8 million lodged.  For the placement tranche of 85.1 million shares, it received “strong” indications of interest for about 552.5 million placement shares, with a total value of just over S$348 million.  The valid acceptances for the reserved shares resulted in all 5.5 million being allotted.  Separately, 21 million shares were taken up by three cornerstone investors, namely Maxi-Harvest Group, One Hill Investments and Qilin Asset Management.  Among the future plans outlined in its prospectus, Koufu is earmarking S$30 million of the IPO proceeds for the building of an integrated facility in Woodlands, which will be home to a larger central kitchen and a centralised dishwashing facility.  Some S$5 million will also be set aside for other expansion plans, such as the acquisition of a major stake in a business-to-business bakery. Slated to be completed in the fourth quarter, Koufu said this will expand its bakery, confectionary and hot kitchen food production business.  Apart from new openings in Singapore, including its first food court in a hospital launching this month, Koufu is eyeing overseas expansion by using Singapore and Macau as “springboards” to enter China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia.  It has also begun negotiations with several commercial landlords and developers to establish new food and beverage (F&B) outlets in Macau.  At the moment, Koufu manages 47 food courts, 14 coffee shops, 81 self-operated food and beverage (F&B) stalls, a hawker centre in Jurong West and the Punggol Plaza. Outside of Singapore, its presence in Macau comes in form of a food court at Sands Cotai Central, as well as two F&B stalls and an F&B kiosk.  STRING OF F&B LISTINGS Koufu’s market debut comes on the back of a string of F&B listings last year, including traditional coffee shop operator Kimly, as well as restaurant chains RE&S Holdings and No Signboard Holdings.  Phillip Securities' research head Paul Chew said the performance of Catalist-listed Kimly has been key in attracting F&B operators to go public. Since the IPO last March, the counter has risen 38 per cent after last trading at S$0.345 on Wednesday morning.  “When you have one bellwether stock like Kimly that pulls up the valuation for the whole sector, it will attract other listings,” he told Channel NewsAsia.  Other listings have had less upbeat performances; RE&S Holdings and No Signboard Holdings have fallen 18 per cent and 33 per cent below their IPO prices, respectively, since their debut on the Catalist board in November.  RHB Research analyst Lee Cai Ling explained: “In general, companies’ first-year performance will be lacklustre following its listing as the companies require time to execute its expansion plans. Secondly, the IPO expenses can be quite significant hence dampening the bottom line.”  Mr Chew also noted that market participants are generally concerned about the lack of organic growth among consumer firms though this has helped by the presence of healthy cashflows and decent dividends.  In the case of Kimly and Koufu, the emphasis on serving up affordable food options at coffee shops and food courts means they are “more defensive consumer staples” that will be less sensitive to economic downturns, he added. Moving forward, Ms Lee expects ongoing trade tensions and slower growth expectations to churn higher volatility in the local stock market. Cautious investors would hence prefer to park their monies with blue-chip companies or defensive stocks, such as consumer staples, she said. Echoing that, CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang said SGX-listed F&B operators, including crab restaurant owner Jumbo and Kimly, have registered a negative 2 per cent year-to-date return as of yesterday’s closing. This compared with a negative 4.7 per cent return for the STI over the same period. “In view of rising trade tensions and uncertainties in the global environment, domestic-focused F&B names are favoured by their defensive nature and stable cashflows,” Ms Yang said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/koufu-serves-up-lukewarm-trading-debut-after-giving-up-gains-to-10539274"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 08:51AM", "tags": ["Dining"], "author": "", "title": "50 Singapore eateries receive Michelin’s Bib Gourmand this year", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos SINGAPORE: Michelin awarded the Bib Gourmand to 50 Singapore food establishments in 2018, a huge leap from the 38 that was given out last year.

According to a letter to parents seen by Channel NewsAsia, SMPS said it would relocate from 2020 to 2021 due to planned upgrading works to equip the school with facilities like redesigned classrooms, a dance studio, an outdoor jogging path as well as an indoor sports hall. Apart from saying that the relocation was made possible due to MacPherson Primary’s impending merger with Cedar Primary in 2019, no other details were given in the letter about the rationale for choosing the holding site.  PARENTS’ CONCERNS: INCONVENIENCE, SCHOOL BUS FARES, CHILDREN’S STUDIES  The distance between the two schools is about 4.5 kilometres, and some parents and family members Channel NewsAsia spoke to said picking up and dropping off their daughters will be a hassle, particularly if they also have other children studying in other schools close to SMPS. One grandfather, for example, says he helps his daughter with the ferrying of her children at times. Apart from one granddaughter studying in SMPS, he also has a grandson studying at a boys’ school in the area, as well as another child in a nearby kindergarten. All of them, he said, start school at around the same time.  “I don’t live nearby, and the children need to leave the house at about 6.30am as it is,” he said. “When SMPS moves to Mattar, I’ll have to run from one end to another. It will be a big headache for me.” “There are some old schools nearer to here,” he added. “I don’t understand why they couldn’t move somewhere nearby.” One mother of three also cited the additional travelling time her daughter will have to face. She explained that while her daughter has a school bus to ferry her to and from school, she takes public transport home when she has extra activities or other CCAs. “My main reason for enrolling my daughter in SMPS was the accessibility,” said the mother, who lives within 2km of the school’s Wilkie Road premises. “She has a direct bus home now, but with the new location, she’ll need to take at least 2 buses, which is an additional 20 minutes bus ride.” Meanwhile, another mother whose Primary 3 daughter takes a school bus to school raised concerns that the bus company will increase the fare when the school moves. The mother, who also lives within 2km of the school, says that currently she pays S$100 a month for the school bus, and expects them to increase it to “at least S$180”. “The new location is really quite far away,” she said. “And to make matters worse, my second daughter will be enrolling into SMPS that year as well, so I’ll have to pay double.” Beyond inconvenience, she is also worried that her daughter’s studies will suffer. Pointing out that her daughter will be part of the first batch to take the PSLE with the new scoring system, she described the issues arising from the school relocation as an “additional burden” she has to worry about. “If it’s a little bit (of inconvenience), I can bear with it,” she said. “But it’s going to be an everyday, routine thing, where she has to wake up earlier to go there and come back later.” “I’m worried that she won’t have the time to complete her homework, and I don’t want this to affect her PSLE results ultimately.” She added that she was “very disappointed” that the school chose to break the news to parents about the relocation via a letter distributed to students. According to her, the letter was given out to students when school re-opened for Term 3 at the end of June. “I went to the school to receive my daughter’s report book during the parent-teacher meeting held just before the school holidays, and no one said anything,” she said. “They could also have emailed all the information to us,” she added, pointing out that student performance updates are regularly emailed to parents. HOLDING SCHOOL THE NEAREST SITE THAT WILL ALLOW SMPS TO REMAIN SINGLE-SESSION In a subsequent letter distributed to parents on Friday (Jul 13), the school explained the rationale for choosing the holding school. For one, it said that it is not easy to look for a holding school as the school’s pupils come from “all parts of Singapore”. Some students, the school said, come from as far as Johor, Sentosa, Tampines and Jurong. Furthermore, the school’s heavy traffic is another factor that has to be taken into consideration, the school said. Traffic assessment by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) noted that around 600 cars travel to the school daily. The school is also “among the few” in Singapore with a “mega fleet of school buses” – about 48 school buses of varying sizes in 2018, according to the letter. The school added that while the Ministry of Education (MOE) has offered the school “a few options”, the holding school at MacPherson Primary is the nearest site which would allow the school to remain single-session. “A double-session model, such as upper primary in the morning and lower primary in the afternoon or vice versa, would mean that children in the same family may need to report and be dismissed from school at different times,” the school said in the letter. “Parents may need to engage two bus companies for two different sessions. Those who ferry their children to school may have to make multiple trips.” As to why parents were not informed earlier, the letter said that information was not confirmed and the upgrading project could be delayed indefinitely if a suitable holding venue for SMPS could not be found. The school explained that MOE and LTA took time to assess the traffic situation at SMPS, and how the move could affect the traffic conditions at MacPherson Primary. “Giving information that is incomplete or premature will cause alarm and frustration as parents will not be able to make any concrete plans for the unclear future,” the school said. “LTA was only able to get back on their approval just before the start of Term 3, 2018. Hence, parents could only be informed in the first week of Term 3, 2018.” In response to Channel NewsAsia’s queries, SMPS principal Pang Wee Mian pointed out that parents were informed of the change, including the location of the holding site, via various communications channels such as letters to parents and the school’s website.  “Parents who intend to register their daughters during the 2019 P1 Registration Exercise were also updated when they went to the school during the 2018 P1 Registration Exercise,” she said. Based on the feedback gathered from parents, the school also provided additional information on the considerations behind its temporary move to the holding site, and the measures it will take to facilitate the move, Ms Pang added.   “For example, we will work with LTA to assess traffic conditions during school arrival and dismissal times, and make arrangements for school bus services,” she said. “There will also be a school-based student care centre at the holding site.” MOE WILL FIRST CONSIDER FEASIBILITY OF ON-SITE SCHOOL UPGRADING In a statement to Channel NewsAsia, MOE explained that when it comes to upgrading schools, it will first consider if it is feasible to carry out upgrading without a temporary relocation, taking into account factors such as the school layout and safety of students and staff. But in the case of SMPS, the upgrading works will be “extensive”, according to its divisional director for infrastructure and facility services Choo Lee See. “This is why, in the interest of the students and staff’s safety, the school will need to move to a holding site,” she said. She added that the holding site was chosen after much consideration, and also has sufficient facilities to ensure that the school curriculum and programmes can continue without disruption. “MOE is working closely with the school to facilitate its move to the holding site, and ensure that teaching and learning will not be affected,” said Mrs Choo. SOME PARENTS STILL THINKING OF TRANSFERRING CHILDREN OUT  The more detailed communication from the school has helped some parents come to terms with what is happening.  One of them is the mother whose P3 daughter takes the school bus. After receiving the letter, she said that while she is still not sure if MacPherson is the “ultimate best choice”, she better understands the school’s rationale. “They did mention that they will source for new bus drivers to facilitate (the move) better. If that does not add on to my financial burden significantly, I will not transfer her to another school.” But another mother feels she will need to transfer her daughter out of SMPS. Her son, she explained, studies in a school nearby, and she plans to move her daughter into the school from next year. Her home, she said, is about 6 kilometres away from the holding site, and her daughter will be taking her PSLE when the school moves in 2020. “It will be a hassle, and she’ll need to adapt to a new school, but I don’t think I have a choice,” she said. “It’s really too far away.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/parents-concerns-st-margaret-s-primary-macpherson-move-10538194"}, {"datetime": "18 Jul 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["work-life balance", "office", "stress", "flexible working hours"], "author": "Carys Chan", "title": "Commentary: Despite flexible work arrangements, work stress has worsened", "content": " MELBOURNE: With technologies enabling remote working, tele-conferencing and instant email access, one would assume stress levels have reduced and work–life balance is now within reach. Yet in a recent study by risk advisory company Willis Towers Watson, 60 per cent of employees surveyed in Singapore admitted to having above average or high levels of stress. Another recent study by recruitment agency Robert Half showed that 25 per cent of Singaporean professionals surveyed revealed they would leave their current job for a better work–life balance. WORK STRESS, THE WORLD’S SILENT KILLER Regardless of our actual job or rank, we have all experienced stress at work. When managed appropriately, work stress has a positive impact on our work performance - think about the burst of adrenalin that carries you through a major project. Work stress becomes harmful to our health and performance when the stress experience is prolonged. Factors that intensify the stress experience include working long hours in a week, facing work–family conflict (i.e., when demands at work interfere with family life and vice versa), having relatively low control over one’s work and work environment, having a lack of supervisory support, and facing high work demands such as a pressure to meet tight deadlines. For example, prolonged intense work pressure drove an accounting lecturer at Cardiff University to commit suicide in February. His workload had increased significantly after he was made deputy section head, meaning he dedicated long hours to his work even during family time and vacation. In studies of British, Australian and New Zealand police officers led by Professor Paula Brough at Griffith University, work stress was found to have both a physical impact (leading to difficulties with relaxing and sleeping, fatigue, migraines, stomach and heart problems) and a psychological impact (leading to people feeling constantly “on edge” or nervous, being irritable with colleagues, or perceiving core work such as assisting the public as a nuisance). Although the stigma associated with stress is declining, many employees prefer to seek professional assistance for work stress through their own general practitioners than an employer-sponsored scheme. Many employees and managers in Singapore also tend to keep their mental health issues under wraps for fear of losing out in promotion opportunities. FLEXIBLE WORK Technology-enabled flexible working has only exacerbated this problem. Work now extends far beyond the office. Most people will put in time late at night, on weekends, and even on vacation. The boundaries between work and non-work are blurred as employees struggle to “switch off”. Employees who work remotely have also been shown to have increased mental health risk, primarily due to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Employees who thrive on feedback and encouragement would also struggle with flexible working, as they require regular social interaction and connection with their supervisors and co-workers. However, as technology continues to push into new areas, it is likely that flexible working will continue. But that doesn’t mean that work stress has to increase. Research has shown that flexible working is not always bad. Working mothers around the world have benefited greatly from flexible working and are now able to fulfil their professional and personal responsibilities. Increased autonomy and control over work can potentially help employees to achieve work–life balance. There is also a difference between having technology and managing technology. Technology should be managed effectively to ensure that its benefits aren’t outweighed by increased work stress. Employees who set boundaries set clear expectations for those around them. For example, not answering work e-mails on the weekend or on holiday reinforces the boundary between work and non-work and ensures that your time off will not be encroached upon by others. In the healthcare industry, millennials are using technology to craft the jobs they desire, including working different shift patterns and job-sharing with colleagues. GIG ECONOMY NOT SO LIBERATING The “gig economy”, comprising mainly of freelance and contracted workers, has emerged as a result of technology-enabled flexible working. The promise of being able to choose when to work is an attractive one, particularly for low-skilled workers whose jobs can be low-paid and inflexible. Yet the “gig economy” has proven to be more inflexible than liberating. As there is no shortage of ride-sharing drivers or food delivery couriers, there are emerging reports of overworked drivers and couriers who clock in at least 12 hours a day just to get by. The isolation and daily work stress faced by this group of workers have driven many to depression. “Gig economy” jobs that do not give workers control and offer low, unstable income are expected to be the leading cause of stress-related illnesses in the next decade. WHAT WE CAN DO  Part of alleviating work stress comes down to changing the workplace culture. Both employers and employees have a responsibility to set parameters and actively dissuade the development of a round-the-clock work culture. Employees need to know that taking a break and not working over the weekend is alright. Employers need to walk the talk. Seeing employers lead by example and encouraging self-care is the best way to ensure employees are comfortable taking the same liberties. Having open, consistent dialogues about work stress and mental health will also encourage employees to speak up and share about their own experiences. Technology can bring both benefits and possibilities, but employers and employees would have to work together to adapt. Otherwise, the advantages of technology-enabled flexible working will quickly become disadvantages. Carys Chan is Lecturer/Assistant Professor of Management at RMIT University.

In the statement, the FAS noted that while it wholly agrees that NS is of vital importance to the nation, it also believes that Davis' case merits serious consideration as it is the first time a Singaporean has been offered a professional contract by a club from one of the top six leagues in the world. A Singaporean playing at the highest level would benefit the \"community and nation\", it added. The FAS said it had made known its support for Davis' request to defer his NS obligations through its communications with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth when the application was first made. \"At age 17, Benjamin has been given a contract to play football at a professional level with Fulham FC, in the English Premier League, and we believe that the support for a Singaporean to play at the highest level will have benefits to the community and nation,\" FAS said. \"We will work with Benjamin and his family ... with a view to seeking to persuade MINDEF of the merits of the application and to assuage MINDEF’s concerns over Benjamin’s national service commitments, and to find a balanced solution to the issue which best serves our nation’s interests,\" added the FAS. The 17-year-old midfielder has signed a two-year contract with Fulham, the newly promoted Premier League (EPL) club announced on its website on Friday (Jul 13). Davis, the first Singaporean to ink a professional contract with a top-tier English club, turns 18 in November. However, in a statement on Sunday (Jul 15), MINDEF confirmed that Davis' application was not approved as he \"does not meet the criteria for long-term deferment from full-time NS\". \"As all male Singaporeans liable for full-time NS put aside personal pursuits to dutifully enlist and serve their NS, it would not be fair to approve applications for deferment for individuals to pursue their own careers and development,\" MINDEF said. Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How on Tuesday also stressed that MINDEF is likely to reject Davis' application to defer NS should there be no new facts presented in his appeal. But, Singapore football's governing body stressed the need for a balanced approach to be taken in the decision of Benjamin's appeal. \"The FAS believes that this is one such case which merits serious consideration even within MINDEF's current framework. We wish for a balanced approach to be taken, to promote and enhance burgeoning talent without at the same time compromising the integrity of the national service agenda.   FAS added that the professional contract offered to Davis by Fulham \"is a reflection not only of the fact that Singaporean footballers have the potential to rise to the top of the profession, but also a recognition of the local coaching and development framework which Ben has come through\". While FAS understands MINDEF's position that requests for deferment should only be in exceptional circumstances, it also said that it believes that a balance can be struck. \"The obligation to serve is universal, and we understand MINDEF's position that requests for deferment from service should be the rare exception for sportsmen rather than the norm,\" said the statement. \"The FAS ... believes that a balance can be struck between player development and national service obligations in this unique case. We also believe that any deferment cannot be open-ended, and that any deferment has to be matched with an assurance to see through Benjamin's national service obligations and a commitment to use this opportunity to enhance the development of national football,\" it added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fas-strongly-supported-ben-davis-ns-deferment-request-10538976"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 10:31PM", "tags": ["Mediacorp", "President's Design Award"], "author": "", "title": "Mediacorp Campus honoured at President's Design Award", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mediacorp Campus, the home of Singapore's key broadcaster, was honoured at the prestigious President's Design Award (P*DA) on Tuesday (Jul 17), after being named Design of the Year.

This is the fourth time that SIA has been named world’s best airline by the London-based research firm, after wins in 2004, 2007 and 2008. “A key 'wow' factor for customers is consistency and this proved to a real asset for Singapore Airlines who scored highly across both product and service,” said Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted. Accepting the award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday, SIA CEO Goh Choon Phong said: “I dedicate it to the 26,000 SIA Group employees who focus every day on delivering the world’s best travel experience to our customers.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-airlines-named-worlds-best-airline-in-skytrax-awards-10538720"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 08:25PM", "tags": ["SCDF", "Auditor-General's report", "AGO"], "author": "", "title": "SCDF says will 'do better' after AGO report finds serious lapses", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Tuesday (Jul 17) said it will “do better” to ensure proper documentation for vehicle maintenance after three of its officers were found to have backdated some paperwork in actions SCDF described as \"serious\". SCDF’s comment came after the release of a report by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) earlier on Tuesday which found that 104 vehicle maintenance records were recreated and backdated by three officers and the contractors to meet AGO’s request for records. The AGO report also found that SCDF had paid S$120,000 to contractors for services not provided. “SCDF had errors/lack of proper documents in respect of five per cent of the maintenance records. This five per cent includes records for decommissioned vehicles where the documents had been disposed off,” said SCDF in a statement.   “SCDF will ensure the proper maintenance of records. The erroneous payments flagged out by AGO have since been recovered.”  The three SCDF officers involved have been disciplined for their “serious” actions, SCDF said.

Should I go to A&E?\" - chatbots that can answer questions such as these may soon be a reality. If you have to make a trip to the emergency department, the chatbot could even give you a queue number based on the severity of your symptoms. In the future, bots powered by artificial intelligence may even be able to diagnose illnesses and tell a patient if their chest pains were due to a heart attack or heartburn. Such chatbots are one of the healthcare solutions that Singapore is exploring to battle an ageing population, a rise in chronic disease and a shrinking workforce. To ease users into the chatbot system, director of Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) Chua Chee Yong said the system could first be used during visits to the doctor.  \"While waiting to consult the doctors, this could mean doing a questionnaire, but behind the questionnaire is a smart chatbot that will ask you a few questions,\" he said, adding that this could build confidence in using chatbots. Mr Chua was speaking on Friday (Jul 13) during a media briefing on new national HealthTech initiatives, which IHiS later unveiled during the National Health IT Summit held at the Singapore Expo on Tuesday. By end of this year, a panel of accredited health chatbot solution providers will be made available to public sector healthcare professionals, IHiS said. These professionals could then work with partners to develop chatbot solutions and pilot them within their institutions. GETTING THE LANGUAGE RIGHT The chatbots will also be customised to understand the Singapore's healthcare system, colloquialisms and Singlish. Terms such “GP”, which is commonly used to refer to general practitioners here, could be something that needs to be specified, as “family physician” or “doctor” is used in other countries, Mr Chua said. “We need to make the chatbot simple, so consumers can accept it, and make it easy to use, and obviously understand some of the local colloquial language and terminology,” Mr Chua said.  Dr Ali Parsa, chief executive of babylon Health, which has a chatbot that can diagnose, said getting users to accept the technology was a challenge. “We have many who accept it, and embrace it, and some who find it suspicious, who need more time to adjust and to accept. The reality is that waiting for innovators and laggards to agree to use the technology takes a long time,” he said. FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE ROBOTICS MORE SEAMLESSLY The healthcare sector will also be developing a Robotics Middleware Framework (RMF) for Healthcare, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced on Tuesday. The RMF will quicken the adoption and coordination of robotics innovations, sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, he said. “By enabling different technology systems within and outside of healthcare to ‘talk’ and work with each other, it creates more opportunities for innovation, cross-sector collaborations, and the deployment of IoT to bring care closer to our citizens, at scale,” Mr Gan said. The initiative is a research and development effort led by the Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology (CHART) and IHiS, involving government and industry partners. There is a need for the healthcare sector to collaborate more widely to solve difficult common problems, Mr Gan added. “In some of these collaborations, we can involve private sector players. We ought to think how we can apply technology and innovate at the systems level, beyond individual institutions which invented it,” he said. NATIONAL HEALTHTECH CHALLENGE At the summit, healthcare concepts by the top 20 finalists from the inaugural National HealthTech Challenge were also on display. Among them: A vending machine to dispense medicines such as allergy and diarrhoea medicines that require the approval of a pharmacist; a wireless call button that can be used by warded patients who do not have the use of their hands; and a scanner that can help prevent foot ulcers and limb amputation for patients with diabetes.  Dr Lee Kheng Hock, medical director of community hospital Bright Vision Hospital, said the foot-screening scanner, which checks for poor blood supply, pressure points, and ulcers, would not require a high level of training to use. “This would take a big load off overworked doctors and nurses,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chatbots-robotics-to-help-ease-manpower-crunch-in-healthcare-10537438"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 07:15PM", "tags": ["SMRT", "Land Transport Authority"], "author": "", "title": "Commuters to undergo security screening at Holland Village MRT station during SMRT-LTA exercise", "content": " SINGAPORE: Commuters taking the train from Holland Village MRT station next Sunday (Jul 29) will have to go through a screening detector and put their belongings through an X-ray scanner before they reach the fare gates.  This is part of an emergency preparedness exercise jointly conducted by train operator SMRT and the Land Transport Authority (LTA).  The exercise will be held from 12.30pm to 6pm, and commuters are advised to cater for additional travel time, said SMRT and LTA in a joint news release.  This is the second such exercise to be carried out at a public transport space this year, after the one conducted at Downtown Line’s Newton MRT station in February.  SMRT CEO Lee Ling Wee said that next Sunday's exercise, code-named \"Exercise Station Guard\" is necessary to put into practice \"established response protocols and maintain vigilance\".  \"It also builds up the confidence and proficiency of our staff so that response plans can be mobilised quickly and effectively during an emergency,\" he added.  LTA's chief executive Ngien Hoon Ping said the public can expect more of such joint exercises in future, in line with the SGSecure movement. \"We would also like to seek their understanding and cooperation to familiarise and prepare themselves in playing a part to prevent and respond to an attack,\" he said.

Previously, users had to book a ride at least 10 minutes in advance. The RydeX service was launched in May by local start-up Ryde Technologies, which started off with carpooling services in 2015. RydeX's new feature will reduce the average wait time for passengers to under five minutes for each booking, Ryde said, placing the service on par with its competitor and ride-hailing giant Grab. It will also enable drivers to take home 20 per cent more earnings, as they spend less time idling between jobs, Ryde added. The feature is available on all services on the Ryde app, including carpool, private-hire and taxis, the company said.  Commenting on the launch, Ryde founder and CEO Terence Zou said that the on-demand feature was launched \"earlier than expected\" because of \"overwhelming market response\". The company, which now has 10,000 private-hire drivers, has been conducting trials for the new RydeX on-demand feature over the last fortnight.  “We (Ryde) have arrived. We picked up from where Uber left off in double quick time. Technology helped us to onboard drivers quicker, match riders faster and ultimately deliver a better experience,” Mr Zou said.  According to Ryde, 80 per cent of the firm's drivers used to work for Uber or Grab, including 33-year-old Kenny Cheah, who was an Uber driver before the company ceased operations in Singapore in March. Mr Cheah, who participated in RydeX's on-demand trial, told Channel NewsAsia that the new feature has reduced his average idling time on the road to about 15 minutes from 30 minutes.  He added that he now gets an average of seven passengers during the morning shift, compared with four passengers previously. Ryde takes a 10 per cent commission from its drivers, while Grab, currently the biggest ride-hailing company in Singapore, takes 20 per cent.  Consultant and regular RydeX user Michelle Lim, 27, said that the new on-demand service is a great addition to the Ryde app. “This service creates greater efficiency and reduces the waiting time taken for commuters.

Chan Mya Aye, a 39-year-old Singapore permanent resident, had hired Ms Ei Phyu Tun in April 2015.  This was done without going through a maid agency, as Aye got to know her through a friend of Ms Tun's relative.  Ms Tun, then 22 years old, came to work in Aye's Choa Chu Kang flat where she lived with her mother, husband, baby daughter who was born in March 2015 and a tenant.  A month after the employment, Aye started scolding Ms Tun for making mistakes in her household chores and for taking too long to complete them. This turned to physical abuse towards the end of June 2015. MAID HIT WITH METAL ITEMS Sometime after Aye's daughter was discharged from hospital for gastroenteritis in early July, Aye started assaulting the maid with items such as metal poles, the metal handle of a duster and an improvised metal hanger. In September 2015, while Ms Tun was washing the dishes, Aye used a metal hanger to hit her multiple times on her face, neck and chest, leaving a 2cm-long laceration on her face. A few days later, Aye was unhappy with how Ms Tun did her chores. She slapped the maid multiple times on her face, before using a metal pole to hit her on her back, hip, arm and legs. Ms Tun would self-medicate by applying traditional Burmese ointment on herself after the beatings, but this angered Aye. After discovering that Ms Tun had used the ointment on Sep 21, 2015, Aye again used a metal pole to hit her multiple times.  After this incident, Ms Tun fled the unit when she saw that her employer was busy. She took a taxi to the Manpower Ministry (MOM) with some help from passers-by. Ms Tun reported the abuse and an MOM officer called the police. INJURIES INCLUDE FRACTURED RIB, LACERATIONS AND BRUISES She was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where a medical report showed that she sustained multiple injuries, including bruising on her forehead, swelling on her cheek, laceration on her ear and back as well as bruising on her legs. She also had a rib fracture. Aye pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means and one charge of voluntarily causing hurt in January last year. Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. On Tuesday, District Judge Sarah Tan sentenced Aye to 25 months' jail, saying that she took cognisance of the fact that Aye suffers from major depressive disorder, as established by two doctors. \"However, I will not be able to agree that her culpability is diminished to the extent that is sought by the defence,\" she said. \"The accused was not suffering depression at the most severe end of the scale.\" \"For each incident, she dealt not just one strike. For each proceeded charge, she had struck the victim multiple times on various parts of the body,\" said the judge. \"Some were in vulnerable parts, such as the face, neck and chest. There were at least six incidents over a three to four month period.\" The judge also noted that the law allowed for enhanced penalties for offences against domestic maids, with the sentence going up to one-and-a-half times the amount of punishment that the accused would have been liable for. For voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons, Aye could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned, or given any combination of the three penalties. After Aye was sentenced, Ms Tun burst into tears outside the courtroom. She told reporters that she felt \"very sad\" as she had to relive what happened in the courtroom. She had flown in from Myanmar to attend the sentencing, and now works at a garment factory in her home country.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-who-abused-myanmar-maid-sentenced-to-jail-10538026"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 04:37PM", "tags": ["football", "Ben Davis", "national service"], "author": "Ahmad Khan", "title": "Ben Davis' NS deferment appeal will be rejected if same facts presented: Heng Chee How", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) will reject Singapore footballer Benjamin Davis' application to defer his National Service, should there be no new facts presented in his appeal, Senior Minister Of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday (Jul 17). Speaking on the sidelines of his visit to the 188 Squadron, Mr Heng said that MINDEF will re-evaluate Davis' case, should an appeal be launched. \"We have conveyed the decision with regards to the earlier application, and all applications, all appeals will have got to be based on facts and we'll have to evaluate the facts, and if the facts are no different then our position will be consistent,\" he said. \"For a country like Singapore, we want to value every Singaporean and we want to develop our talent of course, but at the same time, we must also remember that the purpose for all this development is that we have a country and that all of us actually have a duty to one another and this country.  \"So we have got to make a good balance between our duty to this country and our very genuine urge to enable everybody to reach their highest potential.\" Mr Heng also stressed that MINDEF has been transparent in the way it assesses NS deferments. \"The criteria that MINDEF uses to assess applications has been transparent and has been consistent over time so there's no movement of the goal posts on the part of MINDEF or SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) - this is known to applicants, certainly in this particular case, the family was informed of the considerations beforehand,\" he noted. In a previous statement, MINDEF had said that Davis' application was not approved as he \"does not meet the criteria for long-term deferment from full-time NS\". \"Very few applications have been approved over the years and based on criteria which are made known to the public. In sports, deferments are granted only to those who represent Singapore in international competitions like the Olympic Games and are potential medal winners for Singapore. In the last 15 years, only three have met this criteria,\" MINDEF said. The 17-year-old has signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Premier League club Fulham, the club announced on its website last Friday. Davis, the first Singaporean to ink a professional contract with a top-tier English club, turns 18 in November. Davis had initially joined Fulham on a two-year scholarship deal in July last year, but his performances for the Cottagers' Under-18 side impressed the club which decided to hand him a new deal. Davis made 10 appearances in midfield during his first season. ​​​​​​​In a note sent to NS commanders on Tuesday seen by Channel NewsAsia, the ministry had explained its rejection of Davis' deferment application and said it considered the Fulham contract a \"personal pursuit\". \"Davis’ signing of a senior contract with Fulham FC is a personal pursuit, no different from the personal pursuits by other pre-enlistees like university studies or working in other professional fields,\" the note read. \"We know that football is popular among Singaporeans and the EPL has a keen following here.

The audit covered the financial statements of all 16 ministries and eight organs of state, five government funds, nine statutory boards, four government-owned companies and three other accounts. Ministries and agencies singled out in the AGO report for lapses include the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Ministry of Education (MOE), the People's Association (PA), the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). LAPSES IN CONTRACT MANAGEMENT The PA was flagged for lapses in procurement and contract management for major events such as Chingay 2017 as well as Chinese New Year 2017.  For instance, AGO's checks found that the PA had allowed an officer to make overseas purchases for costumes and accessories worth S$142,200 for Chingay Parade 2017, using cash or through a remittance agent.  \"AGO found that some of the cash sales receipts submitted by the officer had tell-tale signs which cast doubts on their authenticity,\" said the report.  \"Thus, there was no assurance that the amount of reimbursement claimed by the officer was the actual amount of cash that was paid by the officer to the overseas vendor.\" The AGO also found that the PA did not properly manage welfare assistance schemes which included vouchers and groceries to needy residents. Irregularities in contract management were also observed at MINDEF, MOE and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), according to the report. In the case of MOE, lapses were found in school development projects managed by consultants engaged by the Education Ministry.  There were delays in payments to contractors ranging from three months to more than three years for 30 school construction projects. The final amount due to the contractors totalled S$13.61 million, AGO said.  There were also cases where modifications to construction contracts were not properly managed, resulting in an estimated overpayment of S$154,900, said the AGO. \"Given these lapses, there was no assurance that MOE had exercised adequate oversight of its consultants on issuance of final accounts and management of contract variations as well as financial prudence in the use of public funds in these development projects,\" it added. In a statement on Tuesday, MOE said it is addressing the concerns raised by the AGO and is improving its internal processes. \"MOE acknowledges the importance of prompt issuance of final accounts in our school development projects. We are working with our consultants to issue the final accounts of all 14 outstanding contracts by end 2018,\" it said.  The ministry is also recovering the overpayment of S$154,900 arising from contract variations, it said. SCDF OFFICERS BACKDATED RECORDS FOR VEHICLE MAINTENANCE One of the lapses which the AGO described as \"serious\" was the backdating of records at SCDF relating to vehicle maintenance contracts.  The AGO noted that from the documents submitted for audit, records for 104 vehicle servicing jobs were not authentic. They included duplicated servicing records for the same job, as well as discrepancies between the two sets of records.  Said the AGO report: \"SCDF investigated and found that these 104 servicing records had indeed been created and backdated to meet AGO's requests for the records. They were created by three SCDF officers and the contractors.\" The officers responsible have been disciplined and the contractors taken to task by SCDF. In addition, the audit found that SCDF did not have adequate procedures to ensure that two contractors had provided the required maintenance that cost a total of S$1.8 million a year. AGO's test checks found that S$120,000 was paid out for services that were not provided. SCDF had relied on servicing schedules provided by the contractors and did not have procedures to establish whether vehicles had been sent for the required servicing at the right frequency, AGO said. It also did not ensure that vehicles due for servicing had indeed been checked. SCDF acknowledged that more checks were needed and said that an integrated logistics management system will be introduced by 2020. It will be recovering the wrong payments and tightening internal procedures so that it only pays for services rendered, according to the report. WEAKNESSES IN IT CONTROLS As in previous years, the audit found common weaknesses in IT controls which included lapses in user accounts and access rights. The Education Ministry, for instance, was flagged for lapses in the monitoring of IT administrators' activities. This was for the two IT systems that support the management of financial transactions of student's Edusave and Post-Secondary Education (PSE) accounts. \"AGO noted that MOE did not log and review the activities of seven IT administrators who were responsible for scheduling and executing computer scripts to perform financial transactions on students' Edusave or PSE accounts,\" said the report, adding that the activity logs of 16 servers for the two systems did not capture details of the administrator's activities. In the case of MINDEF, the AGO found that there were instances where 33 authorised users with rights to perform procurement activities might have shared their accounts with unauthorised individuals.  \"All these lapses in IT controls exposed entities to the risk of unauthorised operation of the IT systems and of compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the data in the IT systems,\" said the report, noting that similar weaknesses were found in other public sector entities audited last year. RENTAL NOT CHARGED FOR PHOTO BOOTH AT ICA The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) was found to have let a recreation club set up photo booths on its premises without charging rental. The checks were conducted after a complaint alleging that money received from the public by the club was diverted to fund welfare activities and functions attended by ICA staff members. ICA explained that the practice was a historical legacy and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) had given approval for the club to operate photo services back in the early 1980s. Funds were mainly used for sports and recreational activities for current or retired ICA staff, AGO found. Given changes in government policy since, MOF advised that ICA should seek to recover about S$6 million in forgone rental dating back to 2002. ICA said it stopped allocating its space to the recreation club from Jul 1 and would use up club funds of S$2.45 million to pay for rents owed. R&D FUNDS This year's report also focused the management of research funds in a thematic audit, or in-depth examination, of research and development grant projects managed by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the National Research Foundation (NRF). AGO observed that the Government's total R&D expenditure has expanded and the five-year grant budget for A*STAR was S$5.26 billion while that for NRF was S$3.65 billion.  It audited 286 of more than 1,000 projects with a value of S$1.48 billion, or 61.2 per cent of S$2.42 billion awarded in total. It found that while A*STAR had adequate processes for inviting and approving grant proposals, as well as for monitoring grant utilisation, it was slow to recover underutilised funds and did not obtain audit reports for some projects. Meanwhile, NRF had \"significant control weakness\" for the disbursement, monitoring and review of grants, AGO said.  Grant management practices among its directorates were inconsistent and most of them relied on annual declarations by grant recipients for fund requests and project deliverables. It was lax in verifying fund requests totalling S$52.2 million and in some cases, discrepancies in project deliverables were not detected or not followed up on, AGO said. The two agencies said in a joint release that they will address all of AGO’s findings and \"will take the necessary action to enhance the processes for R&D grant management\". In response to AGO's observation that grant management practices were inconsistent, NRF added that it already has a guide to guide all its partners on the management of R&D grants and a \"positive affirmation framework\" established by NRF's audit committee.  However, it will now implement a system of selective checks to \"provide stronger assurance\". In general, Auditor-General Willie Tan noted that some observations in this year's report were similar to those highlighted in the last few years, although the lapses involved different entities. \"More should be done to address these concerns so that the financial governance and controls of the public sector as a whole would be strengthened,\" he said.  The AGO added that it will continue to work with the public sector entities to ensure that follow-up actions are taken.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/auditor-general-finds-lapses-in-management-of-contracts-gaps-in-10537180"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 02:23PM", "tags": ["Ministry of Defence", "Auditor-General's Office report"], "author": "", "title": "Auditor-General report: Overpayment of grass-cutting fees; lax procurement controls uncovered at MINDEF", "content": " SINGAPORE: Instances of overpayment for services and weaknesses in the management of IT accounts have been found at the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) said. In its annual audit report released on Tuesday (Jul 17), the AGO flagged lapses at several ministries and government agencies. Besides MINDEF, other cases singled out include the People's Association, the Ministry of Education, the Singapore Civil Defence Force and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research. Its checks on MINDEF uncovered overpayments on grass-cutting fees for six years, amounting to a total of S$200,000. The overpayments were mainly due to overstatements of grass-cutting areas, and were not detected by the ministry’s facilities management agent (FMA) and contract manager Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), AGO said. “The repeated failures to detect the errors made by the contractor cast doubts on whether the FMA and DSTA had carried out their duties diligently,\" the report said. Further checks by the AGO found that DSTA would not check the accuracy of land areas declared by the contractor unless it was alerted by the FMA to disparities. No checks were conducted by DSTA from Oct 1, 2011, to Sep 30, 2017, and DSTA was unaware of the discrepancies until AGO's query.  Although the role of monitoring the contractor’s services was outsourced to the FMA, AGO said DSTA is still responsible for proper contract management and payments. MINDEF – which paid for the services – is responsible for the use of government funds and should have ensured that DSTA performed its roles effectively, it added. The ministry has informed AGO that the overpayment will be recovered from the contractor after the amount has been determined. Contractual penalties will also be imposed on the contractor for over-claiming and the FMA for failing to check the claims. SHARING OF USER ACCOUNTS FOR PROCUREMENT The audit also found 197 instances involving procurement value totalling S$2.83 million, where 33 authorised users of the Electronic Procurement System (ePS) might have shared accounts with other users. This was based on checks from Apr 1, 2015, to Jul 31, 2017. Nineteen of those instances involved four users who were on overseas leave, AGO said. The accounts of the four users were used by unauthorised persons for procurement activities, violating MINDEF's IT security policy, AGO added, noting that it was difficult to pinpoint who had performed a particular activity when accounts are shared.  MINDEF has informed AGO that disciplinary actions had been taken against three of the four users while the fourth user had left the service.  MINDEF also indicated to AGO that it would continue to educate and emphasise to users the importance of safeguarding IT accounts and take disciplinary actions for non-compliance. It would also enhance the system to prevent sharing of accounts, AGO said.   WEAKNESSES IN MANAGEMENT OF ACCESS RIGHTS Following checks on MINDEF'S ePS, AGO also found that the system owner and all the five units audited \"did not carry out the periodic reviews on user access rights as required”. The required six-monthly reviews of accounts and associated access rights had not been done since April 2013. MINDEF also delayed the removal of unneeded access rights for 41 of 219 user roles checked, AGO said. Fourteen of the roles had access rights to perform procurement activities such as raising purchase requisitions and approving fund commitments, while the remaining 27 had access rights to view information on transactions.  Following AGO’s queries, the ministry removed the unneeded access rights from September 2017 to January 2018, when they should have been removed 53 days to 10.7 years earlier. \"Such weaknesses would expose the system to unauthorised access, thereby increasing the risk of unauthorised procurement activities and risk of the integrity and confidentiality of the date in ePS being compromised,\" AGO said.  MINDEF said it will stress to its units on the importance of conducting regular reviews and maintain proper documentation of reviews conducted.

The new measures include raising the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) and loan-to-value ratio in an effort to \"cool the property market and keep price increases in line with economic fundamentals\", said the government.  Mr Tan said that market indicators had been trending up until the government’s announcement, which had the effect of curbing the housing market and altering market sentiments.  He was speaking at the association's property market update seminar, which was attended by around 260 participants, including developers and property consultants. “With improved market sentiments, home prices gained 1.1 per cent in 2017, compared with the 3.1 per cent decline in 2016 and a 3.7 per cent fall in 2015,” Mr Tan said.  “Although there is no visibility on how the economy will pan out for the rest of 2018 and in 2019, demand for non-housing property will be further dampened as the measures continue to bite, exacerbating the high supply situation.\" LARGE SUPPLY OF PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL UNITS Analysts have also called the move \"heavy-handed\", as launch and sale activities were starting to pick up. Mr Tan noted the large supply of private residential units coming in from various fronts, including uncompleted private residential units in the pipeline with planning approvals that remain unsold, potential units from the second half of the 2018 Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme, as well as a potential supply of units from GLS sites and awarded en-bloc sale sites that have not been granted planning approval yet. “All in, an estimated 36,030 private residential units could be available for sale in 2018 to 2019,” he said.  Mr Tan also added that the latest measure has raised the cost of home ownership, and cooled demand from investors and foreigners.  For example, Singaporeans buying a second home will now pay ABSD of 12 per cent instead of 7 per cent previously, and 15 per cent for their third and subsequent properties. In response to this, crowds of potential buyers flooded showflats across Singapore shortly after new cooling measures were announced in the hope of avoiding a hike in stamp duty or tighter loan limits. “The market is barely into its first year of recovery and has not been allowed time to find its own course and reach a sustained supply-demand equilibrium,” said Mr Tan. Earlier REDAS also said that there was no rationale for the new housing curbs while the market is in the early stages of recovery.   While REDAS “shares the government’s interest in maintaining a stable and sustainable property market”, Mr Tan said developers would have to take stock and reassess the imbalance supply-demand situation.  Despite the backlash against the measures, some experts believe that the government introduced them after keeping a \"watchful eye\" on the property market amid the slew of en bloc sales, record breaking land prices and strong residential price recovery. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/property-cooling-measures-could-worsen-high-supply-situation-10537184"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 01:23PM", "tags": ["People's Association", "Auditor-General's Office"], "author": "", "title": "Auditor-General report: Lapses in People's Association's procurement, welfare assistance management ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The People's Association (PA) was flagged for various lapses in the latest report by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) for the financial year of 2017/2018 released on Tuesday (Jul 17).  These included lapses in procurement for festive street light-ups and the management of welfare assistance schemes.  The AGO report also said there were \"serious weaknesses in controls over overseas purchases and payments which could be exploited.\" LAPSES IN PROCUREMENT FOR STREET LIGHT-UPS PA and one of its grassroots organisations failed to adhere to Government procurement principles of open and fair competition, transparency and value for money for two tenders and four quotations, AGO noted in its report.  The tenders, worth S$500,000, were for the manufacture of decorative items for street light-ups for Mid-Autumn Festival 2016 and Chinese New Year 2017.  The two tenders for both street light-ups were awarded to the same overseas manufacturer, who had been awarded the contracts every year since 2014.  In its proposal for the Mid-Autumn Festival 2016 light-up, the company had listed additional costs including accommodation for its workers during their stay in Singapore, transportation charges for materials and the provision of a site for assembling lanterns.  However, the grassroots organisation did not consider these additional costs on top of the tender price in its evaluation when comparing the price for the proposals.  The same company was also the sole bidder for the Chinese New Year 2017 light-up, and similarly included additional cost items that the grassroots organisation did not mention when seeking approval for the tender.  AGO found in its report that the grassroots organisation should have included the costs of the additional items in the price comparison so that all tender offers could be evaluated on the same basis.  \"Besides the issue of fairness, there was also no assurance that the contract was awarded to the tenderer which could provide the best value,\" it stated.  In addition, the grassroots organisation accepted the proposal from the company after the specified closing time for the Chinese New Year 2017 light-up tender, and allowed the company to revise its proposals and bid price after the tender had closed.  While AGO noted that there was only one bidder for this tender, it said that accepting the submission of late tender proposals and allowing the company to amend its proposals and bid price after the closure of the tender went against the principles of open and fair competition as well as transparency.  \"Such lapses could lead to allegations of unfairness,\" it said.  The contracts signed with the overseas tenderer were also based on the laws of the company's country, and required any unresolved disputes to be filed for litigation in the courts of that country.  As the other country has a different legal system, such provisions in the contracts may not safeguard the Singapore agencies' interests, AGO said.  PA explained that the contracts were prepared by the company and the grassroots organisation without the advice of PA's legal department. Moving forward, the grassroots organisation will prepare contracts, PA said.  PA informed AGO that the procurement lapses were largely due to the procuring team having an inadequate understanding of Government procurement guidelines and operating under time constraints, according to the report.  PA also said it would take measures to improve its staff's understanding and compliance with Government procurement requirements as well as ensure proper contract management documentation, the report noted.  OFFICER SUBMITTED CLAIMS WITH DUBIOUS AUTHENTICITY AGO's checks also revealed that a PA officer's reimbursement claims for overseas purchases and payments for costumes and accessories worth S$142,200 for Chingay Parade 2017, were supported by some supporting documents with \"tell-tale signs\" that cast doubt on their authenticity.  The officer paid for the purchases in cash or through a remittance agent and claimed for reimbursement using cash sales receipts.  There was no assurance that the reimbursement claimed by the officer was the actual amount he paid for the items, AGO said. It added that while he was accompanied by at least one other staff during the sourcing and purchasing trips, he had made two additional personal overseas trips at his own expense to make purchases, settle final payments for earlier purchases and obtain cash sales receipts. This exposed PA to the risk of duplicated and inflated claims, according to AGO.  PA had also posted Invitations to Quote for the items in the Government's electronic procurement system, GeBIZ. It subsequently posted \"no award\" announcements in GeBIZ even though it had awarded the contracts to overseas vendors not registered under the system separately through manual quotations.  AGO said conducting parallel manual quotation exercises are not allowed; as obtaining manual quotations from overseas supplies are not subject to the more stringent controls of GeBIZ, PA could be exposed to risks from the manipulation of bids as well as allegations of discriminatory practices and a lack of transparency.  PA has informed AGO that it has stopped all overseas direct purchases by staff and procured the costumes and accessories for Chingay through GeBIZ since April 2017, as well as reviewed past purchases for Chingay to determine if there were similar weaknesses, AGO said.  Preliminary findings by PA indicate that the purchases and payments made were genuine, PA said in a statement in response to AGO's report.  It added that an independent investigation panel led by a senior officer in the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth was also set up in June this year to provide a second round of checks on the procurement for Chingay 2017 as well as review past overseas Chingay purchases and payments for any indications of fraud.  The officer involved left PA's employment last year, it said.  RECURRING FAILURE TO GET PROPER APPROVALS FOR CONTRACTS AGO checked 189 purchases worth S$6.03 million by 18 grassroots organisations, and found that 13 grassroots did not obtain proper approvals for the award of contracts and variations in these contracts for 25 purchases totalling S$619,900.  Of these, 19 purchases were made with only verbal approvals or approvals after the goods and services had been delivered, while the rest were made with approvals from parties that did not have the authority to grant them.  AGO noted that PA's failure to obtain proper approvals is a recurring lapse, with a similar observation noted in the report for the financial year 2014/2015.  PA's explanation was that some of the lapses resulted from unexpected requirements that arose at short notice.  Nonetheless, it acknowledged that proper approvals should have been sought for the contracts and said that it would review its financial procedures and strengthen the approval processes to cater for contingencies and ensure proper approvals are sought. It also said it would step up procurement training for grassroots organisations, according to the report.  MANAGEMENT OF WELFARE ASSISTANCE SCHEMES AGO test checks also revealed that cash gifts and assistance-in-kind given out under grassroots organisations' welfare assistance schemes from April 2016 to June 2017 were not properly managed.  As a result, there was no assurance that the assistance, which included supermarket vouchers, food vouchers and groceries for needy residents, were given to only eligible applicants and properly accounted for, the report said. For example, three grassroots organisations did not have documentary evidence to substantiate residents' eligibility for cash and assistance-in-kind at festive events.  PA said the applicants were interviewed and assessed for welfare assistance but that it was not documented, and said it would put in place procedures to standardise the evaluation process across grassroots organisations.  AGO also found that there were weak controls over reimbursement claims for food vouchers, with some grassroots organisations failing to invalidate vouchers that had already been used, and not tagging them to the reimbursement claims. One grassroots organisation also did not keep records of authorised representatives who could claim reimbursement, exposing itself to the risk of paying to unauthorised individuals.  In addition, some of the groceries purchased for distribution to needy residents were not the same in type and price as those stated in the contracts with a vendor, or could not be accounted for.  PA said that it would strengthen its procedures on the stock-taking, packing and distribution of groceries, the report stated.  In its subsequent statement, PA said it had reviewed the welfare disbursements and confirmed that all funds were used for their intended purposes.  The association said that welfare assistance schemes are meant to help vulnerable residents in a timely way and that as the needs and circumstances of residents differ, grassroots organisations need to be sensitive and flexible in the way they render help.  \"In disbursing assistance, our grassroots organisations have to strike a balance between strong financial controls, flexibility and responsiveness, while upholding the dignity of our residents,\" it added.  STEPS BEING TAKEN TO REDUCE LAPSES: PA Since AGO's audit, PA and the grassroots organisations involved have taken immediate steps to rectify the lapses by validating purchases, seeking proper approvals and completing documentation, the association said, adding that it will also \"deal with the officers responsible for lapses\". Further steps include improving its online procurement platform for grassroots organisations, centralising the management of high-value contracts by specialised procurement staff at PA headquarters and deploying specialised staff to assist grassroots organisations in their procurement by mid-2019.  In April this year, PA also rolled out e-learning for grassroots volunteers, which includes training on financial procurement matters, it said.  \"PA acknowledges and takes a serious view of the observations of the AGO,\" it said in the statement.  \"PA has put in measures over time which have shown signs of progress. While addressing lapses among the grassroots organisations is a work in progress and cannot be achieved overnight, PA headquarters will continue to have oversight and is confident of making improvements over time.\" In a statement on Tuesday, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said the Government is firmly committed to ensuring accountability and transparency in its use of public resources and has been stepping efforts to address the issues identified by AGO.  \"We agree with AGO that it is important for public agencies to exercise due diligence in managing their contracts,\" it said.  For example, the PA has taken steps to address the financial controls lapses highlighted by AGO and is enhancing its systems to strengthen its procurement and contract management functions, MOF added.  The report covered AGO's audit of financial statements incorporating the accounts of all 16 Government ministries and eight organs of state, the financial statements of three statutory boards, a Government fund, four Government-owned companies and three other accounts.  Other lapses found in the report include weaknesses in Information Technology controls and gaps in the management of research and development grants. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/auditor-general-report-lapses-in-people-s-association-s-10537076"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 01:02PM", "tags": ["JJ Lin"], "author": "", "title": "More tickets to be released for JJ Lin's sold-out concert in Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: An additional 500 tickets per night will be released for Singaporean Mandopop star JJ Lin’s concert here, organiser Unusual Entertainment announced on Tuesday (Jul 17).

His speed when approaching a bus stop near Block 541, Pasir Ris Street 51, was about 14kmh to 15kmh, and he did not slow down, court documents said. He also did not sound the horn on his device to alert pedestrians and commuters that he was approaching. At this point, housewife Ang Liu Kiow, 55, stepped out from the bus stop onto the footpath. Ting applied his brakes but collided into her. His girlfriend managed to jump off just before the collision. Ting hit Madam Ang on her left side. She fell and hit her head on the ground and vomited yellowish fluid.  Ting called the police for help and Madam Ang was taken to Changi General Hospital, losing consciousness in the ambulance on the way.

Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) grew just 1.1 per cent last month, slowing significantly from a 15.5 per cent expansion in May and 11.8 per cent in April, according to figures released by the trade agency Enterprise Singapore. This was less than the 7.6 per cent rise predicted in a Reuters poll of analysts. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports fell 10.8 per cent in June after growing 10.3 per cent the month before. The poll tipped a contraction of 8 per cent. Pharmaceutical exports grew 19.1 per cent in June from the year earlier, slowing from 32.1 per cent growth in May. Shipments of electronics fell by 7.9 per cent, after declining 7.8 per cent in May. The growth of non-electronic exports slowed to 4.6 per cent in June, following a 26.2 per cent expansion in the previous month. Overall, shipments to four of Singapore’s top 10 markets grew, with growth led by the US and Indonesia. Shipments to China, Singapore’s biggest export market, fell by 15.8 per cent after declining 6 per cent in May. OCBC Bank’s head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling described that as “lopsided effects” from the brewing trade tensions between the US and China thus far. “NODX rose to only 4 of our top 10 NODX markets in June, with the largest declines seen in South Korea and China, which could be partly due to the rising trade war concerns,” she wrote in a note.  Citing how growth for NODX in the first half came in at 5.4 per cent year-on-year, down from 9.1 per cent over the same period a year ago, Ms Ling expects the growth momentum for exports to further decelerate into the third quarter.  This will mean “some downside risk” to the full-year NODX growth forecast, “assuming potential further disruptions to regional supply chains if the next leg of US$200 billion of US tariffs on Chinese imports materialises in September”, she added.  Echoing that, DBS economist Irvin Seah said the marginal rise in NODX for June is in line with expectations “of a drop back to reality”. In addition, the big decline in the seasonally adjusted month-on-month figure is the “bigger worry”, which suggests that the “underlying trend is heading downwards”.  Noting how the modest rise in NODX was driven largely by ad hoc items, such as “civil engineering equipment” and the ever-volatile pharmaceutical products, Mr Seah said \"sustainability was always in question\" with risk on the downside. “Moreover, the PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) over key markets have been easing and leading indicators for electronics were also pointing to a softer patch in global electronics demand,” he added.  INCREASINGLY CLOUDY ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Given the slowdown in the external environment, Mr Seah is expecting “an even slower GDP growth” for the Singapore economy in the third quarter.  \"Although the economy had held up well in the second quarter, the impact from the slowdown on the external front will only manifest in the third quarter figures,\" he said. Coupled with the effects of trade protectionism and tighter liquidity conditions, Singapore's economic outlook in the longer horizon is \"turning increasingly cloudy\", Mr Seah added. While holding on to their full-year GDP forecast of 3.5 per cent, Maybank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye also warned of “emerging downside risks” in the second half of the year.  These include the recent property cooling measures, which appear “ill-timed and overly harsh, coming on the back of a visible growth slowdown and an escalating US-China trade war”, Dr Chua and Ms Lee said.  “Property transactions actually fell 42 per cent in June from May, with few signs that foreign purchasers are back in any significant way. Mortgage growth is moreover still slow,” they said, while adding that these suggest existing measures like the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) rules are already keeping household debt in check.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-exports-june-rise-3rd-straight-month-10536766"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 06:35AM", "tags": ["housing", "property", "cooling measures", "en bloc", "collective sale"], "author": "Janice Lim", "title": "The Big Read: Property cooling measures — examining the case for a ‘sledgehammer’  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The latest round of property cooling measures may have caught the market by surprise with its speed and severity, with an analyst describing it as \"a sledgehammer to kill a fly\". However, the warning signs were there: High land prices, a jump in the number of new housing loans, and a wage growth lagging behind economic expansion were some of the red flags which prompted the authorities to take pre-emptive action, several experts said. Add to these the increasing external risks which dampened the economic outlook, and there was an urgency to curb \"euphoria\" in the property market, as Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) chief Ravi Menon put it. \"Economic growth is healthy in 2017, and also in the first quarter of 2018, but there are potential macroeconomic and external risks that are not to be ignored. The rising interest rates, the low inflation rate, political instability and the trade war,\" said Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo, who is the Director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at the National University of Singapore (NUS). WHERE THE NUMBERS STAND According to experts, there are several indicators that guides the Government's decision making on the property market: Gross domestic product (GDP), wage and income levels, banks loan growth, property price index, volume of transactions as well as land prices. Over the past year, land prices have gone up by 15 to 20 per cent, said CBRE head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia Desmond Sim. The surge was fuelled by the en bloc frenzy and record-breaking bids in the Government land sales programme. A Colliers report in April estimates that the total value of collective sales transactions last year to be at S$8.13 billion – the best showing since 2007 – with S$5.83 billion already raked in for the first quarter of this year from 17 successful residential en bloc sales. Meanwhile, record-high bids for Government land sales sites were received, including a Cuscaden Road site which sold for S$2,377 per square foot per plot ratio. If the cooling measures were not introduced, the pace of increase in land prices could go unabated and this would likely lead to upward pressure on property prices, said Mr Sim. Ms Christine Li, senior director of research at Cushman & Wakefield, reiterated that rising land prices would mean developers have to launch new projects at higher prices. This would, in turn, lift the resale prices of other properties in the vicinity, and possibly lead to an unsustainable pace of price increases, she added. Earlier this month, just two days before the cooling measures were announced, MAS said at a briefing on its annual report that new housing loans over the last 12 months had risen by 34 per cent year-on-year. Calling the jump \"worrisome,\" Professor Sumit Agarwal from NUS Business School said that these rates of bank lending \"mimic\" the situation in the United States before the subprime mortgage crisis struck. At the time, housing loans grew 50 per cent between 2004 and 2006, before the housing market crashed in 2007 and spiralled into a global financial crisis. The dramatic rise in lending could \"destabilise the banking system and the economy in whole\", Professor Sumit said. The situation is compounded in a rising interest rate environment, with expectations for further rate increases as the market forecasts the United States' Federal Reserve to increase its rates two more times this year. However, Mr Alan Cheong, senior director of research at Savills, noted that the 34 per cent spike was a cumulative increase over 12 months. He added:  Housing loans growth over time have come down … It's not a good reason to use loan growth as one of the reasons to curb the market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While private property prices currently have not matched previous peak levels in 2013 and 2014, Professor Ong Seow Eng from NUS' real estate department said that back then, the environment of higher interest rates was absent. As a result, the Government's fear that home buyers would find it increasingly tough to repay their loans might have gone up a few notches, the experts said. \"The interest rate may also expose the vulnerabilities of the banking system, if the concentration of loans in real estate in the bank portfolio is too high. Real estate market and the banking and finance market are highly interrelated,\" said Assoc Prof Sing. Nevertheless, the cooling measures were pre-emptive, as data from MAS and the banks showed that the banks' exposure to property-related loans are well within safety limits. Based on MAS statistics, housing and bridging loans in May stood at S$203.1 billion, accounting for slightly more than 30 per cent of total loans. This is in line with MAS regulation which limits the banks' property-related exposure at 35 per cent of their total eligible assets. DBS head of secured lending Tok Geok Peng said home loans \"form a large part of\" the bank's consumer loans. DBS' latest financial report showed that housing loans make up 22 per cent of its total loan portfolio across all the markets it operates in. OCBC's total exposure to housing loans across all its markets is 26 per cent, while UOB's is slightly higher at 27.6 per cent. All three banks did not provide data specific to the Singapore market. Nevertheless, MAS data showed that the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) has remained stable from January to May, hovering between 86 and 87 per cent. LDR is used to measure banks' liquidity, where a 100 per cent ratio means that the bank loans out a dollar to a customer for a dollar of deposits it receives. Market convention generally dictates that an ideal LDR is usually between 80 and 90 per cent. Turning to housing loan growth, MAS statistics showed that this grew by 4.8 per cent in May year-on-year. Mr Paul Chew, who heads research at Phillip Securities, noted that the current level of housing loan growth is conservative. \"It is not irrational lending on (the part of) bankers,\" he added. Mr Sim also noted that the strong growth in transaction volume would automatically lead to a rise in new housing loans. While the indicators in the banking system may not have set off alarm bells on their own, they could be of some concern when one looks at the bigger picture. Singapore's economic growth has generally hovered above 3 per cent over the last few quarters, with latest flash estimates for second quarter GDP growth coming in at 3.8 per cent. While economic growth has been generally healthy, it is \"not as bullish as private property prices\", noted Mr Sim. Assoc Prof Sing also pointed out that wage growth has not kept pace with GDP growth, and this may widen the housing price to income ratio. Based on latest available statistics, real median monthly household income from work grew 1.5 per cent last year, the lowest growth rate since 2009 when the Republic was hit by a global financial crisis Economists had attributed the lower growth in median household income from work to higher inflation in 2017. In contrast, the Republic experienced deflation in 2015 and 2016. MAS expects inflation this year to be similar to last year's level. At the same time, the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) price index showed that private property prices went up 9.1 per cent since its trough in in the second quarter of last year. In comparison, private property prices declined 11.6 per cent over a period of four years from mid-2013 to mid-2017. Mr Sim said that the concern lies not so much in the magnitude of the price increase, but its pace. \"The 11.6 per cent decline took four years. This (9.1 per cent jump) took four quarters,\" he said, adding that prices would jump more if the Government did not act. The experts, however, were split over whether the momentum was too fast. Some noted that if left unchecked, the run-up in prices could be faster than the previous boom cycle from mid-2009 to mid-2013. Others pointed out that what the market has seen over the last year pales in comparison to the start of the previous cycle, where quarterly price increase reached as high as almost 16 per cent. Likewise, the 25 per cent jump in the number of property transactions over the last 12 months divided opinions as to whether it was a cause for concern. This could imply that demand have been coming mainly from investors, he said. Others felt the spike could be a result of a low-base effect from the previous year, and not necessarily an indicator of an overheating market. Ms Li said the increase was significantly lower than the 98 per cent increase in volumes between 2008 and 2010. Then, the number of private residential units sold hit 40,000 over a year, compared with the current 25,000. In raising the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates and tightening the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits, the Government said these were done to \"cool the property market and keep prices in line with economic fundamentals\". It added: The sharp increase in prices, if left unchecked, could run ahead of economic fundamentals and raise the risk of a destabilising correction later, especially with rising interest rates and the strong pipeline of housing supply. COOLING MEASURES: 9 ROUNDS IN 9 YEARS This latest round of cooling measures — the ninth in nine years — comes on the back of several others that have been rolled out progressively since 2009 when private property prices started skyrocketing. Apart from increasing the ABSD rates by five per cent for individuals and 10 per cent for entities, the LTV limit has been tightened by five percentage points. This is not the first time the Government has tightened the LTV limit. It was reduced from 90 to 80 per cent in 2010. That was also when the Seller's Stamp Duty (SSD) was introduced for properties that were sold within one year of purchase, in a move aimed at deterring speculative activity. Between 2010 and 2011, some of the measures were tightened to curb the persistent rise in prices. The ABSD was first introduced in end-2011. More rounds of Government intervention ensued, which saw loan tenures cut and ABSD rates raised as prices continued ticking upwards. In 2013, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework was introduced, requiring banks to ensure that the monthly debt obligations of home buyers cannot exceed 60 per cent of their household monthly income. Prices peaked in the third quarter of 2013, and went on to decline gradually for 16 straight quarters. The Government eased some measures in the first quarter of last year. Under the changes then, the SSD will be payable if a homeowner sells his property within three years of purchase, down from four years previously. BUT DEMAND STILL HOLDING UP Despite several rounds of property curbs, Singapore's property market has proved to be resilient, as prices rose quickly over the past year. On the day the latest cooling measures were announced, thousands of prospective homebuyers flocked to the showrooms, after property developers brought forward the launches to beat the midnight deadline. About 1,000 units across all three projects – Riverfront Residence at Hougang, Park Colonial at Woodleigh and Stirling Residences at Queenstown – were sold under five hours. \"What happened that Thursday night was the fear of missing out,\" said Mr Sim, as he attributed the frenzy to the familiar Singaporean \"kiasu\" trait. In land-scarce Singapore where people are increasingly affluent, it is no surprise that demand for properties has been relatively strong, except during economic downturns. The Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s sent property prices on a free fall, dropping by 35 per cent in 1998. Prices climbed back up but remained relatively subdued until 2005, due to a series of events such as the dot-com bubble burst and the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis, which kept demand at bay. Prices started rising faster after 2005 but in 2008 and 2009, the property market was hit by the onset of the global financial crisis, with prices falling 24.9 per cent. But the down cycle was short-lived, lasting only two years before the market started recovering. Notwithstanding a period of slow decline in prices from 2013 to 2017 as a result of Government intervention, the market has generally been holding up well as the Singapore economy grew steadily. \"It's a sign that the Singapore economy … and the job market is working. Economy is doing well, so people have the ability to buy,\" said Mr Cheong on the resilience of the property market. He added that affordability has increased for certain segments of the population. Income levels of the top 30 percentile of Singapore residents went up between 13 and 18 per cent during the recent four-year period when private property prices were declining. Experts also pointed out that there has been an abundance of liquidity post-global financial crisis. Until last year, the US government had been increasing money supply through quantitative easing and keeping interest rates low. Part of the money is starting to flow back from overseas buyers into the Singapore property market after they had focused their attention elsewhere as a result of earlier cooling measures, some experts said. With places such as Hong Kong, China and Australia implementing their own cooling measures to tame their residential property markets, and a clampdown on corruption in China and India, \"their money has to be parked somewhere\", said Prof Sumit. Domestically, Singaporeans tend to have greater faith putting their money in real estate than in other asset classes like equities or bonds, Mr Cheong noted. \"The market is sending this message … It's ingrained,\" he said. The idea of having a tangible asset that can be bequeathed to the next generation is also etched into the Singaporean psyche. ZACD Group executive director Nicholas Mak added: Quite a few generations of Singaporeans have been conditioned to think that it's good to own your own home … If it's good to own your own home, it's good to own another home because of capital appreciation\" To many Singaporeans, property is a \"sure-win\" investment. There is the general perception that the value of properties would go up in the future, said Mr Ku Swee Yong, chief executive of International Property Advisor. He noted that the strong overall demand has kept prices resilient in the Singapore property market, and this is aided by banks giving out loans based on the valuation set by the value appointed by the developers. He believed that the market would be less exuberant if banks rely on independent valuation. EN BLOC ASPIRATIONS ON HOLD? As part of the latest cooling measures, the authorities also imposed a non-remittable five per cent ABSD on developers buying residential properties for housing development, effectively putting all collective sales projects on the line as the cost for developers has gone up significantly. It has already claimed at least one casualty. JLL regional director of investments, Tan Hong Boon, said that a collective sale committee has pulled the plug on an en bloc bid, after it felt that the gains may not be attractive. Mr Tan, however, declined to reveal more details. At Waterloo Apartments, its collective sale committee has reverted to its original plan of getting the authorities' approval for the site to be zoned for hotel developments. Ms Christina Sim, who heads collective sales at Cushman & Wakefield, said the committee had wanted to launch the development for sale as a residential site, after seeing the higher prices fetched by en bloc residential projects. Since the cooling measures were announced, en bloc bids across the island have been plunged into uncertainty. \"(Is it) game over?\" That's what many residents who are trying for an en bloc had on their minds,\" said Mr Terence Lian, investment sales head of Huttons Asia. The real estate company is the marketing agent for the collective sale of 15 sites. Last week, Mr Lian held separate meetings with the collective sales committees of Kensington Park and Pine Grove, to address any concerns which residents might have, and to discuss the way forward. Given the large size of the two sites, Mr Lian said they were more vulnerable to the impact of the property cooling measures, as developers might not be confident that they can sell all the units before the five-year deadline in order to apply for the remission of the 25 per cent ABSD. After their meeting with Huttons, residents remained upbeat about their en bloc prospects, even though they acknowledged there are causes for concern. \"We were taken aback, didn't expect the cooling measures to come out so fast,\" said Mr Phua Thye Hin, chairperson of Kensington Park's collective sale committee. The secretary of the committee, Ms Tee Lee Lian, said they received feedback from residents that they were concerned how the cooling measures could hamper their en bloc prospects. The 314-unit condominium at Serangoon Gardens has garnered 70 per cent of owners agreeing to the collective sale at a reserve price of S$1.05 billion, and they hope to get the required 80 per cent consent by the fourth quarter of this year. Over at Pine Grove, its collective sale committee chairperson Kogi Murthi said that some owners stopped asking for higher prices after the cooling measures were announced. The current asking price is S$1.72 billion. Her team believes that Pine Grove still stand a strong chance given its location in the Holland-Bukit Timah area. So far, 77 per cent of owners at the 660-unit development have signed the collective sales agreement. Mr Vincent Teo, who chairs the Mandarin Gardens collective sale committee, said they are \"not giving up\", although there is still some way to go to achieving the requisite consent. Currently, 60 per cent of owners of the 1,006-unit development at East Coast have agreed to sell it at an asking price of S$2.48 billion. For residents who are opposed to the en bloc attempts, they are hoping that the government intervention could put the brakes on. Mr A J Leow, who is a resident at Ivory Heights, said he felt \"a sense of relief\" when the cooling measures were announced. Cashew Heights resident Andy Goh was, however, sceptical about any lasting impact from the cooling measures. They would be \"effective temporarily\" only, and the momentum will come back few months down the road, he lamented.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/property-cooling-measures-en-bloc-collective-sale-uncertainty-10533966"}, {"datetime": "17 Jul 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["world cup", "Croatia", "Ben Davis", "sports"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "Commentary: Singapore, don’t let this World Cup lesson go to waste", "content": " SINGAPORE: The dream was nearly complete, the quest for the greatest World Cup result of all time nearly accomplished. In a tournament ruled by underdogs, a pup of a country - not yet 27 years old - hoofed, hared and hustled to the very last, only to fall short against a supremely gifted French outfit. Even then Croatia refused to stay down, as has been their story for the last five weeks in Russia, and what a narrative it was. Back home their small and declining population continue to suffer the effects of economic and political uncertainty, with a football federation awash in corruption scandals that have directly impacted players - including one now recognised as the best at the World Cup, Luka Modric. Like many of his teammates, the captain was made a refugee during the Balkan War, after rebels torched his house and executed his relatives. But Modric and his cohorts flourished partially because of such challenges, not in spite of them. And at the World Cup, their indefatigable nature came to the fore in group matches I had the fortune of witnessing in person, through three straight gruelling knockout games which stretched into extra time, and all the way to the final itself. Here their legs burned and chests hurt but having known worse pain, they pushed and pressed to keep their dream alive, far past the limits of their abilities, until one goal behind became two became three became the end of the line. Croatia did not learn to do this from an elaborate blueprint presented on animated powerpoint slides. They did not practise this on stylishly-pruned grounds of a fancy million-dollar facility. This was as basic a football - and sporting - principle as it gets: Team work, hard work, pure and simple, pays off. HEY SINGAPORE, DO YOU EVEN DO SPORTS? It would appear this message has not been lost on Singaporean fans, both hardcore and casual. Throughout the competition, Croatia’s gutsy displays have won online hearts in the thousands, and at a public viewing party for the final I overheard plenty of keywords like “determined” and “fighting spirit” every time a checkered red-and-white shirt threw himself at the ball. All of which has made me wonder: Why can’t we convert this consumption, this awareness into advancing Singapore’s football and sporting culture? Hold up first - do we have one? Let’s bring it back to our de facto national sport. Parents who want their kids to make a career out of football - few and far between. Void deck and street soccer court culture - fast disappearing, if not disappeared. Youth academies - forced to relocate after residential complaints about noise.  Oh, and there’s that national team stuck in a loop of damnation. All this, while Singaporeans sit glued to their couches, devouring football in the EPL and other European football divisions every weekend, and the World Cup every four years. High-quality, first-rate sporting spectacle taking place not halfway across the world, but on a screen in front of you: Is this not how all athletes - from weekend warriors to professionals to greats - are influenced and inspired, too? I’m no footballer, but football is how I started. Arsenal vs Man Utd on the telly, with the imperious Patrick Vieira - Vicks patch and all - storming from box to box, just running and going at it hard, just doing whatever it takes to propel his side to victory, just like the Croats of today. Watching him, I wanted to kick about with the other kids downstairs, so I started jogging to improve my stamina, got hooked on endurance sport, joined kayak racing as a CCA, then rode the endorphin wave into the national squad for dragon boat and later, rowing. This is, in essence, about loving sport, a journey that can start in a living room and be nudged along by supportive parents, PE teachers and the like. Because in the absence of a dedicated sports ministry and the rapid dissolving of local sports media, the onus is truly on us, the people, to kickstart a genuine sporting culture. How we respond to the news of the day matters, too. Take the unfolding Ben Davis saga: Enough with the finger-pointing and blame-laying, there are only so many instances where online outcry brought actual change. The best response, I feel, is to take real action - get out there and kick a ball, get your kids to kick a ball, and don’t stop until Singapore has a critical mass of footballers doing well enough to warrant a change of deferment criteria. It will take time but we are young, not even as young as a certain World Cup finalist, and the years can be used to slowly wean mindsets to embrace a more conducive attitude and ambition when it comes to sport. Take one argument on the Davis situation which I came across on Twitter. It lost me from the get-go using phrases such as “not a guarantee” and “return on investment”, but regained my attention with the claim that Davis’ chances of playing in the EPL are “romantically dreamy”. I’m sorry but football, and sport, is all about dreaming - and the keeping on of dreaming.

Firms that use such technology are now getting a leg up, as Southeast Asia’s first geospatial industry centre, GeoWorks, was launched in Singapore on Monday (Jul 16). Developed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), the 15,000 sq ft centre houses 22 international geotech start-ups, and aims to connect them with sectoral users and government agencies. This is to match solution providers with companies facing problems, thus driving business growth. Senior Minister of State for Law and Health Edwin Tong, who officiated at the launch, said that such technology is valuable both to businesses and the economy. \"It accelerates the growth of markets, it promotes the economy. Using geospatial services and technology, businesses learn to optimise processes and create innovation,\" he said. The centre will also support the start-ups by providing open data compiled by the Government and expertise from more established companies. One start-up that has benefitted from a collaboration within GeoWorks is United States drone management platform AirMap. It requires information about the physical terrain of cities, which it has obtained using OneMap, a detailed map of Singapore. \"SLA actually has all that data and when we leverage the power of the OneMap platform, we’re able to integrate that data into our systems so we can perform those calculations to simulate what the environment will look like for drones,\" said Head of APAC Business Operations at AirMap Hon Chu. Apart from giving geotech start-ups a boost, SLA said that GeoWorks is aiming to help boost business from the real estate, retail and logistics sectors. More sectors will be targeted in the future. The centre is one out of the 13 initiatives under the Singapore Geospatial Masterplan, which was released earlier this month. The five-year plan aims to improve business processes, make people’s lives easier and enhance government policy-making using new technology. Apart from GeoWorks, initiatives within the plan include the launch of Virtual Singapore, a 3D city model, which will be released at the end of this year. According to Mr Ng Siau Yong, director of the geospatial and data department at SLA, Singapore’s geospatial industry is currently valued at about half a billion dollars.

The 38-year-old teacher, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, taught art to students in Secondary 2, 3 and 4. He was the teacher in charge of the Higher Art O-Level subject at a school, which cannot be identified, and was the victim's art teacher. He had claimed trial to three charges of outrage of modesty - he squeezed the boy's chest, touched the boy's buttock and his groin in the school's art room on Feb 17, 2016. The victim, then 13 years old, was passionate about art and considered it his favourite subject before the offences were committed, the prosecution said.  In Secondary 2, the boy was elected the art representative of his class. He saw the teacher at least once or twice a week, both during classes and to conduct his duties as art representative. BOY STAYED BACK TO WORK ON ART PROJECT ON DAY OF OFFENCES On the day of the offences, the victim had stayed back to work on a group art project. He had been with two other students, but they left early at about 2.30pm. There were other students in the room, but they were not seated near the victim. Sometime after 3pm, the art teacher went to the boy and squeezed his chest. He told the boy that he looked like a character from Japanese hentai manga, or pornographic comics. The boy was shocked and felt uncomfortable. At around 4pm to 5pm, the boy carried the sculpture he was working on into the Higher Art room to ask his teacher for guidance. While helping the boy with the sculpture, the teacher asked him whether he had a girlfriend.  He followed up by asking him a sexual question, making the boy feel uncomfortable. The teacher then slid his hand up the boy's leg and molested him. The boy later said he was \"shocked beyond words and ... stood rooted to the ground\". \"WHY? TOO SHY?\" The teacher asked: \"Why? Too shy?\". He then withdrew his hand from the victim's shorts. The boy backed away from his teacher, but the teacher pulled the boy towards him by his wrist and molested him again. The boy was shocked and did not say anything, but used his hand to try and push his teacher's hand away. He left the room carrying his sculpture, while the teacher repeated: \"Why? Too shy?\" Later that night, he told his mother and sister what happened. His mother called the form teacher, who alerted the school's management. On Feb 18, 2016, the principal of the school had a meeting with the art teacher and the vice-principal.  According to the principal, the teacher appeared \"shocked and remorseful\" and told her \"he knew he was overboard\" in his interactions with the victim. BOY NOW WARIER OF TEACHERS After the molestation, the boy has been \"more wary of others, especially teachers\", the prosecution said.  He also feels very uncomfortable when in a room with only a teacher, as he is concerned that the incident may repeat itself, and does not like art as much as before, due to his \"bad memories of the incident of molest\". The prosecution said the victim was an unusually convincing witness who gave credible and consistent testimony, while the teacher was \"a disingenuous and evasive witness whose testimony was incredible and rife with inconsistencies\".  District Judge John Ng on Monday found the teacher guilty of three charges of outrage of modesty, saying that he had \"no doubt based on the totality of the evidence before me\" that the teacher was guilty. He will be back in court for sentencing next month. In a statement to Channel NewsAsia on Monday evening, the Ministry of Education said the teacher was suspended from duty in February 2016. Disciplinary action will be taken against him, the ministry added.  \"Educators who fail to comply with our standards of conduct and discipline will be subjected to disciplinary action.

Shi, 73, had stopped her car between the third and fourth lanes of Orchard Road, just after Claymore Road, on Jun 29, 2016 at about 5.40pm.  She had been driving in front of a private bus, which was carrying about 20 passengers from Scotts Road to Depot Road. Shi was travelling at a very slow speed, the court heard, causing the 41-year-old bus driver behind her to travel at 5kmh.  He sounded his horn twice to alert Shi. When they came to the T-junction of Claymore Road and Orchard Road, Shi began turning left, with the bus driver following behind.  However, she suddenly came to a complete halt in the middle of Orchard Road, occupying the third and fourth lanes. The bus driver, Mr Wu Xiaokui, could not complete the turn as his bus was blocked by Shi's Ferrari. His vehicle took up the third, fourth and fifth lanes of the five-lane road. Both Shi and Mr Wu alighted from their vehicles, and Shi began shouting at him. Among other things, she told him that he should return to China if he wanted to sound the horn of his bus. Mr Wu told Shi to move her car to the side of the road, but she refused to. STILL INSIDE HER CAR WHEN POLICE ARRIVED Officers in a police patrol car that was going down Orchard Road noticed that there was a traffic jam and drove down to find out what happened. When they arrived, Shi was sitting inside her car which was still parked across two lanes. The officers asked Shi to move her car, but she said she did not want the bus to move off because she was calling the police to report Mr Wu's behaviour. She eventually complied and drove off. Another charge of using insulting words on Mr Wu was taken into consideration in her conviction on Monday. For stopping her vehicle on the road in a manner to cause obstruction to other road users, Shi could be jailed for up to three months and fined up to S$1,000 for the first offence, with the penalties doubled for subsequent convictions. Shi faces six more charges, which she intends to plead guilty to. These include drink driving and removing the ignition key from a crane bucket, locking a man inside for more than an hour. She will return for a pre-trial conference later this month.

Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), developers sold 654 private homes in June compared with 820 units in the same month last year. This was also a 41.7 per cent decrease from the 1,122 private homes sold in May - a nine-month high fuelled by a deluge of new launches.  Including ECs, 706 units were sold in June, a drop from the 1,259 sold the previous month and 1,064 homes sold in June last year. In June, developers launched 726 units, down 41.7 per cent from May but up 356.6 per cent from June last year. The Outside Central Region proved most popular with both buyers and developers last month, with 474 units launched and 374 homes sold. This compares with the 67 units launched and 66 sold in the Core Central Region, and 185 units launched and 214 sold in the Rest of Central Region. The private residential projects that sold the most units in June were Margaret Ville (121 units), Affinity at Serangoon (107 units), Twin Vew (64 units), The Gardens Residences (64 units) and 120 Grange (42 units). Earlier this month, the Government announced new property cooling measures, including a 5 percentage point hike in Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for citizens and permanent residents buying second and subsequent homes, as well as a 5 percentage point tightening for loan-to-value limits for all housing loans granted by financial institutions.  The measures are expected to have the largest impact on the en bloc market as well as the private residential market, analysts have told Channel NewsAsia. Top executives from some of Singapore’s biggest developers have also said the local property market is likely to see some slowing on the back of the surprise cooling measures, although a crash is unlikely.  \"We expect new home sales to decline significantly in the next few months as the market takes stock of the potential implications,\" said Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International. \"Developers and buyers are also likely to shun the month of August due to the Ghost Month which starts on Aug 11.\" Huttons Asia's head of research Lee Sze Teck said 3,508 units were launched and 4,000 units sold in the first half of 2018, compared with 3,960 units launched and 6,039 units sold in the first half of 2017.  Mr Lee said Riverfront Residences, Park Colonial and Stirling Residences were launched for sale in July, while Daintree Residences will be launched this weekend. He noted that after more than 1,000 units were estimated to have been sold at Riverfront Residences, Park Colonial and Stirling Residences in one night after the new cooling measures were announced, double-digit sales continued to be registered at the three projects.  This is \"a testament to the adequate liquidity and fundamentally healthy demand in the market\", Mr Lee said.

MealPal, which was founded in 2016, on Monday (Jul 16) launched its subscription service for meals in Singapore – its first market in Southeast Asia. For a monthly fee of S$95.88, users will get 12 restaurant meals, which works out to S$7.99 per meal.  For S$2 more, MealPal will throw in two additional hawker meals, its general manager of International Markets Paul Clifford told Channel NewsAsia during an interview before the launch. These prices are generally 40 per cent less than if you dine in the restaurant, he added.  The start-up said it has signed up more than 250 food and beverage (F&B) partners to its platform, and these include restaurants like Teppei Syokudo, Tuk Tuk Cha, Soup Spoon, Grain Traders and Folks Collective, as well as half a dozen hawkers each at Amoy Street Food Centre, Maxwell Food Centre and Lau Pa Sat. The service will launch at four business hubs in Singapore – Buona Vista, Central Business District (CBD), Novena and Orchard – for lunch and dinner every weekday, it added. What sets it apart from other meal delivery services like foodpanda, Deliveroo or GrabFood is that it doesn’t deliver. Users will make their orders before 10.30am for lunch and 4pm for dinner, and set the time they will turn up to pick up the food. Another distinctive feature is that these F&B partners will only offer one dish each day with no customisations allowed, Mr Clifford explained, which brings economies of scale. “By identifying which dish to serve, restaurants are able to prepare the orders in advance without having to hire more people or change their processes,” he said. “The service is on top of their usual business, as they will continue to serve walk-in customers … so they can expect additional revenue.” Mr Clifford said in markets like Australia, its partners typically see “thousands of dollars every week” on top of their usual earnings and he hopes Singapore partners will see similar earnings. PREDICTABILITY IS MONEY One hawker who is keen to see what benefits MealPal will bring to his business is Mr Chan Heng Tong, owner of Spinach Soup at Amoy Street Food Centre. Mr Chan, whose stall has been there for the past three years, said the unique challenges of doing business in the Central Business District means he is willing to try new things to help monetise the stall’s lull periods. “Here, there are only three hours (at lunchtime) when the crowd is here,” the hawker told Channel NewsAsia in an interview. “As a stall owner, we like to see people queuing up to buy our food as it creates awareness; but it also means we lose business when we can’t meet the demand.   “So, the only way is to increase manpower, increase the stall space or extend the available time we have to sell food,” he explained. MealPal’s offering helps with the last option, as the preorders that come in would allow his workers to use the otherwise lull period of 10am to 11am “when they do nothing” to prepare the food, Mr Chan said. The subscription model also has another advantage: Customers who preorder will tend to turn up for their food since they have already paid, the hawker said. Office workers from nearby office buildings may stay away if it is raining heavily, as there’s no shelter to the food centre, or shun it due to the tropical heat, said Mr Chan. “Hot weather, we die. Cold weather, we also die. So if they pay already, they die die will come.” As for fast-food restaurant Grain Traders, MealPal allows it to bring its food to office workers who might have decided against eating there due to its higher prices. Grain Traders general manager Joel Ong said that its “restaurant-quality food” has a higher price point - with bowls starting from S$16 - because “we do everything from scratch with only the best possible ingredients”. As such, he recognised that not everyone wants to pay that premium for lunch. “With MealPal offering our meals for almost half the price of a typical bowl, we hope to open up great quality food to more consumers,” Mr Ong said. Mr Ong also pointed out that MealPal is different from existing food delivery services, as the service is not just about convenience - \"skipping queues and making food choices easier with just one food option per restaurant\" - but also about adding value to customers. \"That's the key difference for MealPal - they help to create efficiencies in the restaurant which means customers can save money,\" he told Channel NewsAsia.  CATERING TO SINGAPORE MARKET MealPal’s general manager acknowledged that Singapore is a dynamic F&B market with a strong food culture and, as such, it had localised some of its features to suit the local market’s palate. For instance, it chose to do away with communicating with F&B partners here using email and went with SMS notifications instead. Mr Clifford explained that following a market research this April, the team found out that not many hawkers here own an email account, much less know how to use one. They do, however, all own mobile devices and are familiar with SMS and WhatsApp, he added. Another characteristic here is that lunchtime is a social affair for many office workers and they would head out as groups, the executive pointed out. This is the reason why Singapore is the only market MealPal is launching its WorkPals feature together with its subscription service, he said. WorkPals allows users to opt in and see what another colleague may be ordering for the day and at what time, so they can coordinate their lunch plans, he explained. It is also the only market the start-up is introducing QR code scanning when customers pick up their food orders, as these codes are prevalent here, Mr Clifford said. There are currently five staff here, including former HonestBee head of Food Reece Wee who will be the Singapore country manager, and Ms Joanne Lu, the Partnership and Community associate who was formerly from rival provider Flashmeal, he added. “Singapore has without doubt been our most exciting launch of any other market,” said co-founder Mary Biggins. “The nuances and unique qualities of the food culture here, how work colleagues cherish their lunchtime as an important social part of the day, and the incredible variety of food options from grain bowls to hawker lor mee means our launch couldn’t have come at a better time.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/mealpal-monthly-fee-restaurant-meals-hawker-10526600"}, {"datetime": "16 Jul 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["climate change", "sustainable development"], "author": "Thomas Holenia", "title": "Commentary: The private sector must be new champions of sustainable development", "content": " SINGAPORE: In recent years, we have seen an increase in international and national initiatives to promote a shared focus, empower greater collaborative actions and drive stronger progress towards sustainability. For example, the 17 UN’s Sustainable Development Goals chart the road ahead on major global challenges and focus areas for the next years until 2030.  They represent a significant step forward in understanding the joint efforts that politics, business and society must make towards ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity. In November 2015, major cities, regions, companies and investors from around the world signed the Paris Pledge for Action – a collective statement by non-state actors to ensure that the level of ambition set by the Paris Agreement on climate change is met or exceeded. Meanwhile, Singapore is strengthening its stand by designating 2018 as the Year of Climate Action. So far, the movement has gathered more than 230,000 pledges from individuals, organisations and educational institutions to fight climate change for a sustainable Singapore.  BUSINESSES MUST STEP UP COMMITMENT Noticeably, there is a greater call for businesses around the world to step up their commitment, increase their contributions and take the lead. Together with their employees, suppliers and business partners, companies play an important role in advancing sustainability not only within the company and along the value chain from suppliers to customers, but also within relevant industries and in local communities. Companies can no longer remain passive. The fact is that humankind already has a global environmental footprint that is greater than the planet’s resources can sustain. Continued growth in the world’s population and global economic activity will inevitably lead to rising consumption levels and resource depletion. As sustainability becomes a matter of urgency, companies must do more. However, putting sustainability initiatives into action is not without challenges, when we consider the costs of investment and complexity of engaging multiple parties with different interests, for example. Hence, companies must prioritise goals, balance interests and define their contributions across all areas of the businesses and towards social engagement. A SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT Beginning with their products and solutions, companies have the task to deliver greater performance and improve living standards, but with a smaller footprint. In this situation, achieving more with less is possible only through innovation in a holistic manner. This requires not only developing individual “green” products, but also optimising their footprint across the source, produce, use and disposal phases. As such, more and more companies are offering eco-friendly products and complementing their marketing efforts with consumer education on how to save energy and water during everyday use. In this equation, suppliers are important sustainability partners throughout the entire value chain. The goal is to secure the right suppliers for the long term by applying the same stringent selection process worldwide, regardless of whether they are based in developed or emerging markets. A comprehensive evaluation covers sustainability performance and risks, as well as performance relating to safety, health, environment, social standards and fair business practices. A successful example is the global chemical industry’s Together for Sustainability initiative, where 20 leading companies have joined forces to set the sustainability benchmark for supplier evaluation and build a strong community of sustainable suppliers internationally. EMPLOYEES AS AGENTS OF CHANGE Notably, employees are the most important asset and success factor for any company. When it comes to implementing sustainability strategies, it is people who make the difference – through their dedication, skills, and knowledge. They contribute to sustainable development, both in their daily business lives and as members of society. To increase employees’ engagement, a viable first step is sustainability training on the company’s sustainability strategy, targets and initiatives, history of sustainability, and global challenges. The objective is to equip employees with deep knowledge and understanding, and enable them to contribute and engage various stakeholders through dialogue and collaboration. Additionally, in an international environment, online and classroom training can be conducted using standardised training materials to ensure consistency. With this approach, Henkel has trained more than 50,000 employees as Sustainability Ambassadors globally. The next step is to motivate employees to make their contributions in their work and beyond. For example, employees can act as ambassadors at their sites through various initiatives, such as bring-your-own-cup, using centralised bins, and observing a daily earth hour during lunch time. They can also visit schools to teach young children about sustainable behavior in their homes and in daily lives. Besides imparting knowledge, these school initiatives can encourage children to be an influencer among their family members and prepare them to be future sustainability leaders. Additionally, companies can support employees in volunteer and community projects that make a positive social impact, by providing funds and granting paid days off from work. In a comprehensive survey in 2014, our stakeholders’ responses highlighted the importance of integrating sustainability in all activities and ownership in addressing environmental impact. It is thus clear to us that sustainability must be an integral part of corporate strategies and anchored in corporate cultures. This is fundamental to positioning companies and their employees at the forefront of driving sustainable development.

The 17-year-old midfielder has signed a two-year contract with Fulham, the newly promoted Premier League (EPL) club announced on its website on Friday (Jul 13). Benjamin, the first Singaporean to ink a professional contract with a top-tier English club, turns 18 in November. Former Hougang United coach Philippe Aw told Channel NewsAsia that if Benjamin has to juggle serving NS and playing football, his growth as a footballer will be hampered. \"It is guaranteed that his development will be curtailed for sure,\" said Aw.  \"It's not easy to serve NS and play football. A young player who trains in Singapore versus a young player who trains in Fulham - it's a big, big difference. The environment here is not positive enough, not challenging enough for a young player to develop faster.\" A former Singapore international who declined to be named agreed with Aw. \"This responsibility has always been a hindrance to the development of Singaporean footballers,\" he said. The experience of playing abroad is a crucial one for a young player, said Albirex Niigata midfielder Adam Swandi, who spent almost two years at the academy of French club FC Metz. \"It helped me to mature as a player, that was the vital age for me to change from an aspiring player to a professional player,\" stressed Adam. He returned home for the 2015 Southeast Asian Games and later served his NS, and said he understands the rationale in having to do so. \"Of course as a footballer, you won't want to waste the two years which could be an important period, but NS is a part (of life) which you cannot escape and there are some positives that you can take away from it,\" he said. \"There are so many benefits of being a Singaporean - this is part and parcel of life, you have to go through it.\" In MINDEF's statement, the ministry said that very few applications have been approved over the years and for sports, deferments are granted to those who represent Singapore in international competitions like the Olympic Games and are potential medal winners for the nation. Only three have met this criteria in the last 15 years - swimmers Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen, as well as sailor Maximilian Soh. But Aw believes that the criteria for deferment should also take into account the level of football at which Davis could soon be playing. \"It is a gold medal in football - to play football in the top five leagues in the world,\" quipped Aw.\"There's never been a Singaporean who has done this.\" Former national coach Vincent Subramaniam, however, disagrees that Benjamin's development could be severely affected. \"The hampering (to his footballing growth) is minimal,\" he said. \"There's definitely a possibility that he can continue to train. Talent doesn't go away, it stays with you.\" He pointed to the example of South Korean star Son Heung-Min, who could still have to serve mandatory military service despite being one of the biggest Asian stars in Europe. \"That kind of sacrifice is one that has to be made for the country,\" insisted Subramaniam, who had several full-time NSmen under his care when he was coach of Singapore Armed Forces FC from 1996 to 1998.  \"Ben could find that it might be best to serve NS as early as possible, get it out of the way and then he can pursue his career in football.  \"That would be the best option for him, because if he has to serve at the peak of his career, that would be even worse.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ben-davis-ns-fulham-midfielder-progress-football-community-10532210"}, {"datetime": "15 Jul 2018 04:51PM", "tags": ["Josephine Teo", "Lawrence Wong", "Ong Ye Kung", "Jurong"], "author": "Deborah Wong", "title": "More ministers hit the ground at constituency visit", "content": " SINGAPORE: Issues related to jobs, education and housing were among the concerns raised by Jurong residents who met Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Sunday morning (15 July). The three ministers were on a Ministerial Community Visit, the first time three ministers have conducted it together. It is typically conducted by one minister. Speaking to the media, Mr Ong said this will be the new format going forward as the ministers were able to attend to residents' concerns more effectively as a team. “So as we were walking just now, you can see residents with children going to school, they will come and talk to me about their school work, tuition, about applying for polytechnics.  “Those who are looking for work, they will talk to Minister Josephine Teo, and those facing issues with HDB they will talk to Minister Lawrence Wong,” Mr Ong explained.  “So I think it's useful.

But the scale of our consumerism – leading to more plastic than fishes in our oceans in 2050, and microplastics from disintegrating plastic waste contaminating our water, food chain and us – demands a similarly robust response. Addressing our plastics problem requires tackling it at its root – the use of plastics, in particular single-use plastic. If we do not want to be nourishing our families with plasticised food and water, or have more sea animals die because we “need” straws to drink, then minimising plastic usage seems logical. Merely attempting to recycle, amidst this avalanche, is as effective as stopping sea level surges with a wine glass. Complementing plastic use reduction is circular economy design – worth the investment in producing thoughtful, well-made products that stand the test of time, and potentially a sector of opportunity for Singapore going forward. China’s decision to stop being the world’s rubbish dump, resulting in our plastic “recycling” simply getting burnt and taking up limited landfill space, should provide further impetus. Plastic can be essential, in limited and specific situations, such as medical purposes and assisted living for the physically challenged. But the bulk of the 9 billion tonnes of plastic ever created do not stem from essentials. Rampant and indiscriminate plastic usage does not only injure or kill sea creatures; microplastics taint breast milk with which we nourish babies, and even donor organs. Allowing this to continue could mean plastics rather than AI transforming humans in the future. IRRESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES MAY BE RESPONSIBLE The challenge may be more fundamental - do businesses have the right to force society to bear their negative externalities? Would plastics companies guarantee that microplastics from their products are safe for human or animal consumption? Privatising profits and socialising costs is a surefire way of escalating the tragedy of the commons. Encouraging corporate irresponsibility, ensures that the rest of us – government, civil society and responsible businesses – have to invest time and other resources to help corporate babies clean up their own mess. Obviously, this is not sustainable. There are innovative ways to collect and even liquefy plastic waste, but should society bear this cost? Beyond plastics, Obike is just one of the more public and recent examples of the pain that corporate irresponsibility could cause. KFC’s move in particular, seems to have prompted significant attention. Its scale and the siren call of fast food in general, means an estimated “reduction of 17.8 metric tons of single-use plastics in a year”. McDonald's in contrast, has not extended its UK civil action to replace plastic straws with paper ones to Singapore. If businesses cannot regulate themselves, it may prompt regulatory action ala the EU. For an advanced nation aware of climate change’s impact, why do we still allow caviar environmental standards to muddle through? HOMEGROWN COMPANIES RISE TO THE CHALLENGE Forward-thinking small enterprises such as homegrown Plain Vanilla Bakery are taking responsibility – and even more holistically. Without a huge public relations budget, it is serendipitous that their green policies came up in my newsfeed. They chose not merely to forego plastic straws completely, but bottled water sales too.  Combined with a decent discount to encourage you to bring your own bag and reduce takeaway waste, they might be seen to have taken on some financial risk – though it is likely to be more than offset in the medium and long term by increased customer goodwill and business. What heartens me at least as much is its food waste reduction programme, including importantly, redistribution of unsold food to those in need in Singapore. MOVE THE NEEDLE, GIVE THE PUBLIC SKIN IN THE GAME The current war on plastic may have stemmed from the injuries or deaths of sea creatures, but the way to move the needle is for the public to understand their skin in the game. US journal Science notes that 8 million tonnes of plastic are dumped into the earth’s water system per year, with toxic particles ingested by fish and up the food chain. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world, is only the size of France because the rest have disintegrated. Microplastics taint our food and water; which good parent wants to feed their children with plastic-laced food? The rising accrual of microplastics and toxins in our bodies should concern policymakers responsible for the well-being of citizens, particularly given Singapore’s imperatives of health, fertility and productivity. We have other major national priorities that demand mental bandwidth, design thinking and other resources, so I hesitate to recommend an all-out strategy to tackle plastic given our hierarchy of needs. Moreover, the largest part of oceanic plastic waste – fishing nets – does not stem from Singapore. But here are a select few recommendations for thought. MAKE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE The most important actions our Government can take to mitigate the health risks is a focus on water distillation instead of filtration, as distilled water is free of microplastics.  If micro-filtration to remove microplastics can be deployed at lower costs, that could be a less disruptive and more desirable way of achieving mass microplastic-free water. Another significant move we should take is to enhance and accelerate plans to have water dispensers publicly available, with at least one in each building, including MRT stations, bus interchanges and malls. While that is targeted at reducing the need for sugary drinks, the presence of water dispensers reduces the need for the purchase of bottled water, and makes it sensible to carry one’s own. A Whole-of-Government approach might also see Singaporeans use an app that pinpoints the locations of water dispensers, giving the public assurance of access to drinking water everywhere – a bonus as temperatures soar and keeping hydrated becomes a health imperative. To encourage Singaporeans to be environmentally conscious, the same app could highlight F&B outlets that have abolished single-use plastic completely. A challenge is how to compensate current drinks sellers – be it in malls or in hawker centres. Rental rebates commensurate with bottled water sales, and helping them pivot to healthy drinks by enlisting the help of universities or social impact enthusiasts through hackathons for instance may be some ways. More available fresh juices free of artificial sugar, are likely in Singapore’s health interests and also help raise the profit margins of entrepreneurs versus bottled water. STOP USING PLASTIC UTENSILS Protecting our culinary heritage in hawker centres, would seem to dovetail with serving food in actual plates and utensils, rather than plastic ones, which is not known to be heat-stable. Many of us have been concerned with cafes and restaurants serving food in plastic disposables even for dining in. If this is because of staff costs involved in washing utensils, why not invest in a dishwasher with bulk purchase deals, so that we can have clean utensils that are cheaper in the longer run economically and environmentally? TACKLE SCOURGE OF PLASTIC USE There is much that can be done to tackle the scourge of plastic use in our part of the world. Five Asian countries – China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand - account for 60 per cent of plastic waste leaking into the ocean, according to Ocean Conservancy and the McKinsey Centre for Business and Environment. Singapore could leverage its ASEAN Chairmanship – in its Year of Climate Action – on evaluating and building the case for the minimising of plastics for our greater good, beyond plastic to climate action overall, and beyond the plastic sector to the entire corporate sector.

And as the ASEAN coordinator for ASEAN-EU relations after this August, he said that Singapore hopes to establish a framework to identify areas with potential to work out deals. Mr Lee was speaking to the media after attending France’s National Day Parade in Paris, where he was the guest of honour - the first Singaporean leader to receive the distinction. On the Jul 14 every year, France holds a military parade in Paris to commemorate the storming of the Bastille prison in Paris in 1789, and the beginning of the French Revolution. And every year, France invites a country to participate in its National Day Parade.  Last year, President Emmanuel Macron invited US President Donald Trump, who now wants to hold a similar parade in the United States. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was also invited this year, but he had to pull out due to natural disasters in his country. In a symbolic gesture of strong bilateral ties, jets from the Singapore and French air forces soared over Paris in a combined flypast. Troops from Singapore and Japan also marched alongside more than 4000 members of the French armed forces and other participants. Speaking to the media after the parade, Mr Lee said the bilateral cooperation between Singapore and France is very good. And he elaborated on the France-Singapore Road Map for Deepening Cooperation in Digital Innovation, Internet Governance and Cybersecurity which was issued on Friday. “Their last presidential election they got hacked by some black operators and they had a very effective counter operation which neutralised and prevented it from interfering with their domestic political process,” said Mr Lee. “We are also developing our own cybersecurity because we are talking about having a smart nation and having all our systems go online and in the cloud.  \"You must have your defences up, otherwise you are naked, so it’s an area where we can both work together and the cybersecurity roadmap spells out how we can further this cooperation, and it reflects the intent on both sides to do a lot more together on this issue.” Mr Lee also said that the EU and ASEAN have agreed to restart the process of establishing a free trade agreement between the two blocs. The EU and ASEAN launched talks towards a pact in 2007 but abandoned the process two years later, with the EU opting instead to conduct bilateral negotiations with individual states. “As coordinator we hope to be able to establish a framework to identify where are the areas where we have the potential to work out deals,” said Mr Lee. “Working out the deals will probably take longer than the end of this year, almost certainly. But if we can identify what the shape of the deal can be like, where the major opportunities are, our trade-offs are, then I hope we will have better successes there.” Turning to the wave of populism sweeping the world, and also the uncertainty over the US administration’s policies under President Donald Trump, Mr Lee said it means that Singapore will have to work with like-minded partners around the world who agree that the multilateral system is important, and that there is a need to work within an international framework of rules. He added, “One of the things we hope for is that the European countries are able to manage their social and political tensions, so they do not end up with radical governments. And then they can play a role internationally. Otherwise, the governments may be likeminded with you but if they can't hold their own domestically, I think they will not be on a strong platform.” With France playing in the finals of the World Cup on Sunday against Croatia, Mr Lee also said he had wished his host well. France has deployed 110,000 members of the security forces across the country for the back-to-back celebrations of its National Day and a hoped-for victory in the World Cup final.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/eu-and-asean-to-restart-fta-process-pm-lee-10531412"}, {"datetime": "15 Jul 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["SDP", "Singapore Democratic Party", "PAP", "Workers' Party", "Paul Tambyah", "Chee Soon Juan"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Policies, politics and paranoia: Singapore Democratic Party chairman Paul Tambyah goes On the Record", "content": " SINGAPORE: Paul Tambyah exudes a good-natured amiability befitting any good doctor and teacher. But the Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore and Senior Consultant at the Division of Infectious Diseases at National University Hospital dutifully reminds me that he is here in a completely different capacity. “I have to get the disclaimer out of the way. Everything I say here is my personal opinion and has nothing to do with the university or hospital,” he says with a smile.  For good measure, I ascertain that his “personal opinion” encompasses his opinions as Chairman of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), a post he was elected to in September last year. “Of course,” he says with a grin. At first glance, one may not detect the impassioned politician and activist that Dr Tambyah embodies. This facet of his personality emerges gradually as we talk about the state of Singapore's politics, democracy and various policies. But through it all, while critical of the PAP Government, Dr Tambyah maintains his affable demeanour and gives credit where credit is due.   For instance, while he feels that MediShield Life is inadequate in terms of making healthcare affordable to the masses, he acknowledges that it is “a huge advance in that it took in people with pre-existing conditions”. Before we discuss his political career though, he tells me what attracted him to medicine. It was the “combined influences” of his parents. His father was a doctor and his mother, Leaena Tambyah, is a well-known advocate who was instrumental in starting Singapore’s first school for students with multiple disabilities. To listen to the full interview click here. CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIVISM - “THREE STEPS FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK” In a way, it was his profession as an infectious diseases specialist that led to his activism and later, his political awakening. “Worldwide, one of the most common infectious diseases is HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. It’s a disease which is associated with a lot of stigma and discrimination.” He became involved in an advocacy group, Action for AIDS Singapore. “They are activists who take steps to reduce stigma and discrimination. I saw that people in Singapore can make a difference if they feel strongly about something and if they can gather the evidence and the data, eventually the Government will change.” His involvement in civil society intensified and later he became one of the founding members of human rights advocacy group MARUAH. “But one of the things I realised is that there are limits to what civil society can do. Civil society can give feedback but ultimately, all the levers are still with the Government. If you really want to effect change, in fact, former prime minister Goh Chok Tong said that you have to join a political party.” Dr Tambyah doesn’t entirely agree with this argument even though he has accepted “that’s the way it is in Singapore”. He compares civil society here to that in other developed countries where activists play a more significant role. “There are fewer restrictions on civil society and civil society actually is encouraged. They often get grants from the government for various projects. There is a give-and-take with the government. “You win some, you lose some, but you are treated with mutual respect and I think that is perhaps slightly lacking in civil society today in its interactions with the Government.” He describes progress as being “three steps forward, two steps back”. For example, MARUAH was gazetted as a political association and that, according to him, “severely limited” their ability to work with other civil societies or organisations outside of Singapore. They were also not allowed to accept foreign funding. “MARUAH was set up for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) human rights mechanism. But if they wanted to hold an event and invite human rights activists from the Philippines, they’d have to apply for permits. These are just barriers which make it difficult to move forward towards an ASEAN human rights mechanism.” He also points to more restrictions on Hong Lim Park’s Speakers’ Corner in terms of “having to check IDs, to make sure we don’t have foreigners attending events”. I ask him if he can see it from the authorities’ standpoint that there is a case for putting in place measures to guard against foreign interference. “Definitely. You don’t want foreign interference and I think the worst thing is covert foreign funding. But when you are talking about something like ASEAN where there is, by its very nature, a collaborative effort amongst countries, I think that there has to be a place for transparent, well-documented foreign funding, if necessary, on a case-by-case basis and I think the blanket ban forces people to jump through hoops.” “SPEAKING UP SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NATURAL … NOT AN ACT OF BRAVERY” Dr Tambyah started getting involved in SDP activities in 2010. While he spoke at SDP rallies during the 2011 General Election (GE), his first GE as a political candidate was in 2015. He was part of the SDP team contesting Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC). One of the main areas in which he wanted to effect change was healthcare financing. “I was looking for a party with a very clear-cut ideology and the SDP is very much left-of-centre. It was in line with my own personal views on basic human rights, like housing, healthcare and basic education.” I ask why he didn’t consider the Workers’ Party (WP), which had a presence in Parliament then. “The WP haven’t published the same number of policy papers. I’m pretty sure they share very much the same views as we do on many of these issues but the SDP seemed to be willing to go out there and be heard.” He admits his friends and family were worried that joining an opposition party would put his career in jeopardy. “Lots of well-meaning people said to me, “Oh, you have to be careful”. He recalls how after he gave a speech at an SDP rally in 2011, he went to Mount Elizabeth Hospital to visit a friend and people asked him if he was there to buy a clinic. “They thought my days in the university were numbered and I think that when I got my promotion in 2013 to full professor with tenure, everybody was pretty shocked.” He says while he, too, was worried initially, he “was tremendously reassured by the senior leadership of the university”. “I think there are elements within the university who strongly feel that there is a need to speak up about issues which are important, as long as you do it in a responsible and rational way. “The university has changed; I think it’s a lot more open but also social media has come into play. And you’ve seen what happened with Cherian George when he was denied tenure (at Nanyang Technological University, NTU). He had a voice and he was able to talk about it and I don’t think that NTU came out very well from that whole incident.” But I wonder if he would have gone ahead and joined an opposition party if it meant losing his job. “First of all, I don’t think that anyone should lose their jobs or have their careers put in jeopardy for speaking up or championing an alternative narrative in a democratic society. At this stage in my career, I am fortunate to have options that many Singaporeans may not have. I am now an internationally well-known academic clinician who could possibly work in private medical healthcare in Singapore or in academic medicine overseas. But to reiterate, speaking up should be considered natural for citizens of a democracy, and not an act of bravery.” THE PROBLEM WITH SELF-CENSORSHIP While his own experience has been positive, he says it is still very hard for the SDP to attract candidates because of fears that involvement in an opposition party would jeopardise their livelihoods.  “We’ve had individuals within the SDP who are very talented, very capable. There’s actually an individual who was very active in the SDP and she said that she was told by people in her organisation that they are grassroots leaders and they don’t think it’s appropriate for her to be involved in an opposition party. “I said, 'That’s ridiculous. You should complain.' But she said that they are the senior management so who can she complain to? You will get good people who have courage of their convictions but it is very hard to move people from the centre because they are just too afraid for their bread-and-butter.” When I put it to him that this is possibly a function of self-inflicted fear, rather than people reacting to Government directives to discourage involvement in opposition politics, he agrees, but points out that “self-censorship is so much more effective than actual censorship”. “Even though the Government doesn’t sack people because they are involved in opposition politics, there’s often that perception about that.” He illustrates the power of perception with another example. “You don’t have to lock people up. All you have to do is make them think that you are going to lock them up or think of somebody who was locked up 10 years ago or 15 years ago and when they censor themselves, it’s much more effective.” Considering that he agrees this could be partly a manifestation of self-censorship rather than the ruling party issuing directives to organisations to discriminate against opposition party members, I ask him whether he thinks there’s anything the PAP can really do about it. “The PAP Government is amongst the best in the world at running campaigns. All they need to do is run a campaign to say, join the opposition and your career in the civil service will take off. I mean that’s an extreme example but they could say, the civil service is independent. We’ve got people from the Workers' Party. We’ve got people from the SDP. Feel free to speak up. Singapore is a diverse place which encourages views from all ends of the political spectrum. “We could have little mascots and we could have bumper stickers and posters on buses and it’ll be tremendously effective.” For a moment, I think he’s being facetious, but when he raises the suggestion again later in the interview, it dawns on me that he is serious.  He does feel certain actions by the authorities continue to fuel a climate of self-censorship. He cites as an example, the 2017 arrest of activist and artist Seelan Palay for presenting a performance art piece in tribute to political detainee Chia Thye Poh outside Parliament House.  POLITICS AND PARANOIA The climate of “walking on eggshells”, as he describes it, is exacerbated by how the Government handles parliamentary debates. He describes how he thinks the ruling party can better engage the opposition.  “Every time the Workers' Party asks a question in Parliament, the Government could turn around and respond the way I might to a student who asks a question, and say, 'Oh, that’s a really good question', and start to deal with it. “Instead, they turn around and they chide them. If you don’t have all the information and you ask a question, then you’re slammed and you’re asked to apologise like Sylvia Lim was asked to - that puts a certain amount of fear into individuals.” He is referring to WP chairman Sylvia Lim being asked to apologise to the House earlier this year for alleging that the Government had floated “test balloons” before announcing an impending Goods and Services Tax hike. I put it to him that most ruling parties would consider it a natural instinct to defend their policies and make a point of it if they feel the other parties are trying to cast aspersions on their intentions.  “But still, there has to be some degree of balance because otherwise it’s going to backfire. The whole Sylvia Lim example, I think it won Sylvia a lot of sympathy points - the fact that people are trying to make her apologise for asking an honest question. You can say that the question is a stupid question, you can try to criticise her for that, but trying to make her apologise for asking a question seems to be a little bit like shooting yourself in the foot because it makes you come across like a bully. “In a parliamentary democracy, if somebody asks you a question, you can make them look small or really silly, but to treat every question as an attack on your own personal integrity, to me, that's bordering a little bit on paranoia.”   CAN THE SDP CONVINCE VOTERS? We move on to talking about why the SDP has not made any headway in winning parliamentary seats, not even in the 2011 election. “You must remember, we were going from a state where the party was almost non-existent. It was the subject of several lawsuits. It was on the verge of bankruptcy and to get over 30 per cent of the vote, I think, was a pretty significant achievement.” I wonder why the party’s baggage didn’t discourage him from joining it. “The fact that they persevered despite all of the slings and arrows that had been flung against them, that was very impressive because that shows a certain kind of courage of your convictions.” But he feels that media coverage favouring the ruling party has worked against them. “In 2015, on Cooling-off Day, the front-page headline on The Straits Times was Mr Khaw Boon Wan saying you may not get a PAP government. There were these WhatsApp messages going around with fake bookie odds. No one has ever owned up to propagating trying to scare people into thinking that the PAP would lose the 2015 election despite all indicators pointing in the opposite direction.” He also cites the difficulties the party faces in holding community events as securing venues run by town councils and the People’s Association is challenging. He puts this down partly to the “self-censorship” phenomenon we discussed earlier. “But I’m an optimist. I don’t think that this self-censorship is going to be able to continue forever and if social media develops and as people become more open, then I think the PAP will realise that they need to come down on these people who are second-guessing them and tell them 'Hey, loosen up. We are not going to give you a phone call and tell you to not allow them. Let them have their event in some basketball court'.” But the PAP’s ability to mobilise state resources in other ways is “very, very difficult to try to go up against”, he says. “During my first clinic session after the election, a patient of mine who I’ve been treating for many years wheeled himself into the room in his motorised wheelchair and he said, 'Doc, you guys ran a good campaign. Too bad you all lost.' I said, 'Thank you. By the way, where do you live?' Then he said, 'We live in Yuhua, but you know, (Minister) Grace Fu gave us this wheelchair.' Then I said, 'She didn’t give you the wheelchair. This is paid for by your taxes'. “He said, 'No, no no, she came to my house with an entourage of people, with her photographers and she gave me the wheelchair'.” Even though Dr Tambyah says he reiterated that 'it’s your money that went into this wheelchair', his patient 'refused to accept' it. “This was a guy I’d been looking after for 10 years. He knew me. We got on with each other very well. But at the same time, he felt indebted to the ruling party politician because she was able to, in his mind, provide him with mobility.” However, I put it to him that if the PAP Government lets Singaporeans down, and if the opposition manages to come up with better policies, they could get the votes regardless of the PAP’s party machinery. Considering the way Singaporeans have voted in the last two elections, I suggest to him that Singaporeans don't see the point of an opposition party or don't consider the opposition parties, including the SDP, as being worthy of a vote or as being able to govern. But he reiterates that the various hurdles prevent the SDP from truly convincing voters of the party’s merits, even thought they \"have really dedicated volunteers, and for Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) they can cover almost every household at least twice\".  “The administrative constraints, the media constraints and the self-censorship issues affect people. Even social media is constrained by the licensing issue and the various actions that have been taken against individuals for crossing the poorly defined Out of Bounds or OB markers. This deprives Singaporean voters of essential information we need to allow us to cast a ballot for the people most able and willing to take care of our interests and well-being.” AN INDEPENDENT ELECTION COMMISSION AND MORE SMCs However, could upcoming changes help? For instance, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said Singaporeans are likely to see smaller GRCs on average and more SMCs in the next election. Some analysts have said this could help opposition parties who generally have fewer resources to put together large teams, but Dr Tambyah is “cynical” about this. “You can design three-member GRCs very strategically. You could arrange it such that these three-member GRCs are all in constituencies that you could win.” He says what he would like to see instead is “an independent Election Commission” that could ensure that “electoral boundaries will be drawn up with all the parties and civil society and all the individuals involved”. At this point, the Election Commission is under the Prime Minister’s Office. He also suggests “a return to all single-member constituencies”. “Before the GRCs came up, Singapore has always had a multi-racial parliament. We’ve always had members of parliament from the Malay and Indian communities, and the proportion of people from the minority communities actually was highest in the earliest years when we were all single-member constituencies. So, I don’t buy the argument that GRCs are essential for racial representation.” I point out a survey that showed when it comes to deciding who should hold the nation's highest positions, Singaporeans prefer it be someone of the same race as they are. “But obviously that was not borne out by the facts. Like in the Bukit Batok by-election, Mr Murali Pillai won handily against SDP Secretary-General, Dr Chee Soon Juan. It was the first by-election the PAP has won since 1992 and it was quite obvious that there was somebody from a minority race who was able to win. I think those surveys have to be taken with a pinch of salt.” HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING Aside from the politics though, the policies matter. From the very beginning of his political life, Dr Tambyah has been campaigning for a better healthcare financing system. He still feels that MediShield Life, for instance, needs to be improved. Most notably, the high deductibles concern him. “Healthcare is a right, not charity”, he says and cites research that showed the state of healthcare financing in the early days of Singapore. “In 1960, the World Health Organization sent a delegation to Singapore in Malaya to study the healthcare system. Our health minister at that time was Ahmad Ibrahim and he pointed out that Singapore had a pretty decent healthcare system in 1960. The unique thing about it was that it was all free at the point of care. They introduced the S$1 charge at the Outpatient Dispensaries (OPDs) and I think it was a S$5 charge for the inpatients.” That was how, he says, Singapore’s healthcare system operated right up till the mid-80s. “In 1983, when we had the blue paper on Singapore healthcare, Singapore had an infant mortality rate that was lower than the UK and the US. So we had really good health outcomes with very cheap healthcare and that I think shows that it’s achievable. If you wanted to pay a bit more to stay in some private hospital, you could but basically, you should not have to worry about getting your cancer treated or your bypass done because it could be done for a really cheap price if the government was the sole proprietor.” He feels that the privatisation of healthcare was a \"mistake\", but wouldn’t an entirely state-run system run the risk of being inefficient? He acknowledges this and suggests instead a national universal health insurance system where the government takes over administering insurance, but not the provision of services.   “The government is the financier but not the provider. This is what happens in Australia and France. Also Germany to a certain extent.” His vision includes basic healthcare with minimal deductibles and co-payments. When I raise the risk of overconsumption under such a system, he says it may not be a direct effect of enhanced insurance.   “There is no direct evidence that significant numbers of patients are going out of their way to subject themselves to unnecessary surgeries or treatments just because these are paid for by insurance riders or free. Most people do not like to see the doctor or subject themselves to chemotherapy or injections or to take bitter medicines.” He says that cases of overconsumption that we are seeing today could be due to other reasons. “There is an asymmetry of information. Most people have a very limited knowledge of medicine or medical procedures and depend on their healthcare providers for the information that they need to make decisions about what procedures and treatments are best to deal with their ailments. “Healthcare costs have risen in Singapore for many reasons including, primarily, the commercialisation of healthcare which has led to the need to provide returns to shareholders who own major healthcare providers. This leads to incentives which distort the market by rewarding overconsumption of resources.” For example, he says some patients do certain tests and procedures as inpatients to “claim insurance benefits” and thus maximise profits for the owners of the healthcare infrastructure, rather than as outpatients which would have been cheaper. \"The doctor becomes an employee who has to answer to the shareholder while at the same time, maintain an ethical practice towards his patients. So it's a huge challenge.\"  He also points out that the medico-legal environment in Singapore and elsewhere may encourage doctors to potentially over-investigate patients for fear of litigation or being accused of negligence. “A well-run, evidence-based national health insurance scheme similar to what is proposed in the SDP Healthcare Plan would avoid the problem of overconsumption by restricting benefits to those procedures which are proven and supported by solid scientific evidence,” he says. To finance Singapore’s future needs such as healthcare, naturally, more funds will be required. I ask him how best he thinks these can be generated. “In Singapore currently, you don’t have pay estate duty, you don’t have to pay capital gains tax, you don’t have to pay tax on dividends, you don’t have to pay tax on fixed deposits interests.” He thinks it’s time Singaporeans do. But might this make Singapore less competitive as a wealth management hub? “I don’t think so because I think we have the skillset, individuals with the talents, the infrastructure, so if we just went back to some kind of a more equitable, a progressive taxation system, I don’t think that we’ll undersell ourselves. These are people who are just parking their money here. If they paid a little price, I don’t think they would feel it that badly.” Among the other policy issues that concern him is housing. “Somewhere along the way, public housing lost its focus. Instead of becoming a basic human right to have a roof over your head, with the asset enhancement policy, it became a tool for multiplying your wealth or a vehicle for speculation.” He calls it a “misguided” approach to public housing. When I remark that many Singaporeans have, in fact, benefited from this, he says it’s just a “short-term gain”. “If you’ve got more money, then you should invest in private property.” He also points to how the Ministry of National Development has recently highlighted the limits of HDB leases. “I think the Government is going to deal with it. They’re probably going to extend the lease. It’s too much of a political time bomb.” THE FUTURE OF SINGAPORE’S OPPOSITION As we progress to talking about the future of the opposition in Singapore, something that he says is “on the cards\" is an opposition alliance. The SDP recently invited members of all the other political parties to a private event where it became apparent to him that their ideologies could be aligned. “We recognise that we probably have more in common than actually what separates us. Most of us are in favour of transparency, accountability, more social justice. “Dr Tan Cheng Bock was invited and he was going to come for our event but something happened at home, so he couldn’t make it but he sent three of the senior members of his team and they were there. So we think that a figure like him, who has been in Parliament, who has run election campaigns successfully, could be a catalyst to bring people together.” When asked what role Dr Tan could formally play, Dr Tambyah doesn’t seem certain.   “I don’t know what he’s going to do but all he needs to do, if he decides to form his own political party, is to draw all the other parties to form a coalition. There are many different possibilities as to what he could do.” This and the idea of an alliance is \"an ongoing conversation\", he says. I wonder how his party plans to convince voters of its merits in the next election considering the PAP’s performance in the last election and the new policies it has introduced since 2011. “There have been schemes such as the Silver Support Scheme and the MediShield Life which are baby steps towards a national old-age pension and a comprehensive national health insurance policy respectively. However, both are limited severely in terms of the quantum provided (up to a maximum of $250 a month) for the Silver Support Scheme or the high deductibles for MediShield Life.” He also raises other issues that Singaporeans seem concerned about. “Prices were raised across the board for water and electricity. We in the SDP consider healthcare, affordable housing and equitable quality education as basic human rights which should be guaranteed to everyone not dispensed as charity or traded as commodities. The one-party system is a dinosaur which is overdue for extinction in Singapore.” His ideal vision of a democracy is one that includes many political parties. “I think what’s important is that there will be a free discussion of ideas, a thinking-through of plans of what’s good for Singapore.” I ask him what he thinks of suggestions from some quarters that Singapore doesn’t need a multi-party system in order for good governance to be the order of the day. “I think history tells us otherwise. What’s happened in Mexico, Taiwan and Malaysia is that single-party rule cannot survive for too long because it becomes fossilised.

Outside, changes have swept the landscape, old buildings falling and new ones rising – skylines and shorelines of a 21st-century nation transformed.  But in his mind’s eye – and in his bold-stroked acrylic and watercolour paintings – Mr Sim’s homeland is one where bumboats still crowd the Singapore River, ferrying goods and passengers; and where Chinatown’s open-air markets thrive and its five-foot ways are bustling with locals, not tourists. They are pictures, frozen in time and memory, from early childhood when his father used to take him to these places. “My father brought me outdoors (for) painting. I saw the Singapore River and all the artists,” the 50-year-old said, words spilling out without pause in a torrent of English and Mandarin, sometimes incoherent and muddied, like the river of his paintings during monsoon season. It’s through his art that he finds order, focus and clarity in expressing himself. \n\n\n\n\n Along the IMH corridors are hung some of his paintings. We counted 15 on our short tour, and there were more, including renditions of the old Woodbridge Hospital off Yio Chu Kang Road where he used to live. More of his artworks are stuffed into cupboards in two rooms – and he bashfully takes them out one by one to show us, such as one of a Chinese dragon and another of a tiger. His sister Cindy Sim later lets on that he paints these predators when he is feeling angry or moody. AS A CHILD, LEARNING FROM THE MASTERS Her brother was four when he started doodling and painting. “He was really good,” Ms Sim recalled. “He could draw a very precise animal.  For me, drawing a cat is like two balls, two ears and a tail. For him, he could draw the whole cat. Recognising his potential, his father took him to the Singapore River and Kampong Glam to paint and learn from the artists who used to congregate there. Those veterans were generous in sharing their knowledge of stroke techniques, different mediums and colours. The young Kah Lim was even under the tutelage of renowned local artists Ong Kim Seng and the late Ong Chye Cho. “There were a few artists who thought his painting was very nice so that’s why they advised him,” said Ms Sim. “He didn't go through any other proper training.” Their father had also wanted to dissuade his son, the eldest of three, from drawing too many pictures of Chinese deities, as he thought that “drawing scenery and buildings was more meaningful”, added Ms Sim. Those childhood visits became the strongest and happiest memories of her brother’s life. “He enjoyed those days. That's why he could remember those days better. Ever since then, he has kept drawing those (landscapes),” she said. He also does still life (while CNA Insider was with him at IMH, he painted the garden); tackles portraits, and paints from photographs. His flair for painting was rewarded at a young age when he won cash prizes at a couple of art competitions, and he seemed destined to be a professional artist. WARDED AS A TEEN When he was 14, however, his behaviour started to change. He started talking to himself, refused to leave the house and wanted only to paint. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Then when he was 17, he fell from their sixth-storey flat but miraculously survived. “I don’t know why, but I believe he felt sad on that particular day, and he just looked down and fell,” said Ms Sim. He was subsequently warded long-term at the mental hospital. His family were at a loss for what to do, but he seemed to adapt well. “At the old IMH children’s unit, he was doing quite okay and was quite happy there because every day he was drawing,” said his sister. Long-stay patients are classified as those who have been warded for more than a year, where all possible discharge options have been explored and failed. And Mr Sim is now one of the longest-staying residential patients at IMH. Over the years, his art has been a record of sorts of his emotions. “When he was in a bad shape, he drew more of the (Chinese) gods,” said his sister, adding that he would paint landscapes when he is in a good mood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When asked why he liked to paint, he went off at a tangent once and broke into a National Day song. But another time, he said with a smile:  My work is my expression … It’s my dreaming world. It’s my dream to create the picture. When he paints or draws, he is focused. He constantly shifts the easel to adjust to changes in the lighting. Holding a pencil loosely, he makes broad strokes on the canvas, with seemingly little purpose to the untrained eye, but the result is an impressive sketch of IMH with its garden in the foreground. WATCH: His gift unfettered (6:16)  BIG-HEARTED, PROLIFIC ARTIST While some may think him a little odd, most people are more fascinated by his artwork. “Because he just draws, he doesn't disturb anybody,” said Ms Sim, who thinks her brother has faced “not so much” stigma. But he is generous to a fault, which got him into trouble before. He’s so generous he could take anything from our home to give to anybody, since young. His sister added that whenever she visits him with food, he would share it with other patients. He has a hearty appetite, and often requests for local fare such as char kway teow and roti prata. On special occasions, like Chinese New Year and Mother’s Day, Ms Sim – who moved near to  IMH so as to visit him more regularly – brings him home, as their mother has difficulty walking and their father is still working. “He brings all his paintings, and puts (them) all over the place. And he can remember all his paintings,” she said. “He’d say, “Where’s my pigeon?’ Then I’d say, ‘Oh, upstairs. I’ll go and take it.’\" He is such a prolific artist that he has paintings stored in a warehouse, and his sister doubles as his curator, framing those works she deems worthy. Her home and office are also scattered with his art. Some of his pieces are displayed in the offices of other healthcare institutions like the National University Hospital. He also sold two paintings to non-profit organisation BizLink for its range of These Abled People greeting cards. And now, some of his works have been selected for the 'One of Us' exhibition, organised by T-Touch – Temasek's staff-driven volunteer initiative – to highlight the importance of mental health. Ms Sim is grateful for this chance to showcase his paintings, as he has been requesting for his own exhibition for some time. “He keeps asking me to keep all his art pieces before they disappear, so that when he gets an art exhibition, he (can) show them. Of course, he also wants to sell his paintings,” she said. BECOMING AN OBSESSION Mr Sim said he also likes “singing, swimming, table tennis, badminton”. But he has a tireless commitment to painting, to the point of it becoming an obsession. And that is cause for concern, said IMH occupational therapist Lee Shu Hui, who works with schizophrenia patients on social skills such as interacting with others and behaving in a group setting. When she was first introduced to him, it was in a room full of his paintings, and there was not much space for them to move about. While painting is his strength and should be encouraged, his goals all revolve around painting, and “it shouldn’t be the only part of his life”. “We’re also looking at other aspects of his life: Whether or not he can take care of himself … whether he can overcome some of the conflicts he faces in the ward itself,” said Ms Lee. While painting helps to calm Mr Sim down, he gets frustrated at those times he does not get to paint. And this is not helping his condition. “We have to have a balance; we need to be able to pace ourselves also. Therefore we have to set structures for him,” added Ms Lee.  We can have that allowance (for painting). But we can’t do that every day. Mr Sim recognises Ms Lee’s point, even though he has told her before: “I can paint without food – I can don't eat; I can don't sleep.” When he spoke to CNA Insider, he said: “Must rest. I every time continue to paint, never take a deep breath – cannot.” His sister still dreams of reintegrating him into society, and even hopes that he can sell his paintings and help their parents buy a bigger home. There is always hope. But as with all IMH patients, it is a matter of assessing their mental condition, whether they are ready and whether such a move is beneficial for them. Said Ms Lee: “If we’re able to find that support in the community, and they’re able to manage, of course we’re more than happy to help them reintegrate.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/schizophrenia-imh-sim-kah-lim-artist-singapore-mental-health-10530970"}, {"datetime": "15 Jul 2018 12:35AM", "tags": ["football", "Ben Davis", "MINDEF"], "author": "Nigel Chin", "title": "MINDEF rejects Fulham signee Ben Davis' application for NS deferment", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singaporean footballer Benjamin Davis' application to defer his national service (NS) enlistment has been rejected by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF). In a statement on Sunday (Jul 15), MINDEF confirmed that Davis' application was not approved as he \"does not meet the criteria for long-term deferment from full-time NS\". \"As all male Singaporeans liable for full-time NS put aside personal pursuits to dutifully enlist and serve their NS, it would not be fair to approve applications for deferment for individuals to pursue their own careers and development. \"Very few applications have been approved over the years and based on criteria which are made known to the public. In sports, deferments are granted only to those who represent Singapore in international competitions like the Olympic Games and are potential medal winners for Singapore. In the last 15 years, only three have met this criteria,\" MINDEF said. MINDEF added that the decision was made in consultation with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and was communicated to Davis and his parents on Jun 11. \"Mr Davis was also notified that he is due for enlistment and must dutifully serve NS along with others in his cohort,\" the statement said. It was earlier reported that Davis had signed the first professional deal of his career with newly promoted English Premier League (EPL) club Fulham FC.  The 17-year-old joined Fulham on a two-year scholarship deal in July last year. Davis turns 18 in November. He is the first Singaporean to sign a professional contract with a top-tier English club. The contract runs for two years, until June 2020. Speaking to Channel NewsAsia earlier, his father Harvey Davis said they were informed by the Football Association of Singapore that it will help to put in an appeal to MINDEF and that they were working on the appeal. \"As the father of Ben, I really hope that common sense can prevail so that Ben can be given the opportunity to not just pursue his dream of playing in the EPL, but also the dream of every young Singaporean footballer and to make Singapore proud by being the first Singaporean to play in the EPL,\" said Davis. When Davis learned about the contract, he had told Channel NewsAsia that the deal was \"fantastic news for Singapore football\". \"It shows that Singapore can produce footballers who can play at the highest level in the UK,\" he said. \"Ben has been trained here in Singapore and shows to all Singaporeans that you can be coached in Singapore and achieve the highest level for a 17-year-old on the international stage,\" his father said, echoing his son's sentiments. \"If Ben is not deferred then the message is clear and simple; that there is no chance or opportunity for team sportsmen to compete on the World stage. What message does this send to our children and young Singaporeans who dream of playing professional football in Europe and the EPL or any other team sport,\" he added. Davis also said that the authorities had been informed of his son's professional contract with Fulham as well, noting that his son would eventually serve his NS. \"We have been completely transparent with the authorities who were immediately informed of his scholarship contract back in 2016 and his professional contract back in May this year.  \"We fully understand the importance of serving your country and my older son has already served and so will Ben, as will my younger boy.\" Drawing comparisons between his son and Olympic swimmer Joseph Schooling, Davis also commented on Schooling's deferment. \"If Joseph had not been given the deferment and opportunity he would never have won the Olympics.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mindef-rejects-fulham-signee-ben-davis-application-for-ns-10530834"}, {"datetime": "14 Jul 2018 11:05PM", "tags": ["National Archives Singapore", "history"], "author": "Wendy Wong", "title": "Old TV scripts, footage among 400 items donated to national archives", "content": " SINGAPORE: Scripts from the once popular television series Friday Background were among more than 400 items donated by members of the public to the National Archives of Singapore (NAS) on Saturday (Jul 14), as part of a donation drive calling for historical materials related to the city's past. The scripts for the 1980s current affairs programme were donated by a former producer, who worked for the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation - the predecessor of Mediacorp - for almost a decade. Other historical treasures also surfaced during the one-day drive, including never-seen-before footage of 1950s Singapore filmed by a young British soldier stationed in country from 1952 to 1956. His great grand-nephew Nigel Sumner, who has lived in Singapore for the past seven years, came across it by chance when he visited the now 87-year-old in London.  \"It was a casual conversation.  I actually had no idea he’d been in Singapore. We were talking about my experience living in Singapore and he mentioned he’d shot some film while he was there,\" said Mr Sumner, 42.  \"For me it’s really interesting to see the locations I can still identify as part of Singapore , like Boat Quay and Beach Road, and to see how they’ve changed over time,\" the creative director said. \"I’d really like to see something done with it - I was trying to think of something interesting I could do with it. I take a lot of photos on my phone and they stay there and nothing really happens to them. So I thought if (NAS) was able to do this for some good, hopefully there can be a way it can be utilised,\" he added.  In conjunction with its 50th anniversary, the NAS hopes to receive historical materials preceding 1970, such as photographs of old landmarks and organisations that have since ceased operations, as well as copies of broadcasted events - in particular the first television broadcast on Feb 15,1963 and the 1969 National Day Rally Speech, which are believed to have been lost in a fire in the 1960s. \"We know Singapore has undergone major urban development since the late 1960s,\" said Ms Noor Fadilah Yusof, assistant director of records management at NAS. \"The city landscape changed during this period.  \"We want to collect photos before the 1970s, mainly to help Singaporeans rediscover the sites and scenes that are gone or lost after the major urban development.\" \"These are the untold stories that we should be keeping or retaining for current or future generations,\" she said.

They will then glide at a speed of up to 200km/hr towards the Marina Bay floating platform before experiencing a minute-long free fall, which is double the time taken for their normal jumps. \"We've been doing (the free fall segment) for many years, so we've been looking ... how we can improve in the show and how we can even excite the crowd even more,\" said First Warrant Officer (1WO) Ivan Low, team leader of the Red Lions for this year’s NDP.\"We decided to stretch the benchmark a bit higher so we can have a better show for the audiences. We have the challenge of bringing the whole group right to the middle of the show area. The responsibility is a lot, but we have practised more than enough for this show,\" he added.  Before the Red Lions performance, the eight-member Naval Diving Unit (NDU) will free fall more than 1,800 metres towards the water from a Super Puma helicopter - an operational capability that it utilises for actual operations.  \"The showcase gives an insight to the maritime operations conducted by the divers when they need to enter an area of operation that is not easily or quickly accessible by other means,\" the NDP organising committee said in a press release. \"During actual operations, an accompanying sea boat is also first deployed from the air into water, serving as a platform for the divers to move off quickly for their mission.\"  In their debut NDP free fall performance, the divers will deploy their parachutes at about 1,200 metres in the air before descending to a designated drop zone in the waters around the floating platform.  \"We have to do a lot of competency training to make sure we are able to fall stable and fall as a team,\" said Master Warrant Officer Eric Tay, who is the team lead of the NDU's free fall water jump. Landing in the water means the divers have to battle water currents on top of the wind changes from all directions. They also have to do more than carry a parachute on their descent. They have to wear tactical vests, and carry an assault rifle and dive fins, all amounting to about 50kg.\"When you are at a free fall, approximately at a speed of 120km/hr and with the big flap behind your legs, it catches a lot of wind,” he said. “That is the difficulty we face apart from the equipment that we wear that change the aerodynamics.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-2018-red-lions-to-perform-record-wingsuit-jump-from-3-800m-10530646"}, {"datetime": "14 Jul 2018 03:00PM", "tags": ["Humanities", "education", "technology", "Tommy Koh"], "author": "Tommy Koh", "title": "Commentary: Humanities at the heart of a holistic education in a tech-driven world", "content": " SINGAPORE: We are living through the fourth industrial revolution.  The first was the Agrarian Revolution which happened about 10,000 years ago. Humans stopped foraging for food for survival. They learned to grow food and domesticated animals. Food production improved and human settlements grew in size, leading to the emergence of villages, towns and cities. The second revolution, called the Industrial Revolution, began in the 18th century and accelerated in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was powered by the invention of the steam engine, electricity and mass production. The third revolution began in the 1960s, with the invention of the computer, semi-conductors, personal computers and the internet. That is the world we have been living in. The fourth revolution began at the turn of the 21st century. It builds on the third industrial revolution as it is also being driven by technology and digitalisation. New technology and innovation have given rise to companies which disrupt the status quo, for example, Airbnb, Grab and Alibaba.  The world is being transformed by robots, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, big data, smart cities, block chain, the sharing economy, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, nanotechnology and financial technology. The fourth industrial revolution is remarkable for its speed and breadth. It is affecting every sphere of human activity.  Singapore must therefore prepare its young people with the knowledge, skills and mindset to take advantage of the new opportunities. This is why the Government has emphasised what is called STEM - meaning science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  This is not wrong but it does not tell the whole story. Many founders of new and innovative companies are not graduates of STEM. Founder and CEO of Razer, Tan Min-Liang, for example, is not a graduate of STEM but law. He is our youngest self-made billionaire. CASE FOR HOLISTIC EDUCATION What the world needs is to educate our young people both in the sciences and the humanities. We need technologists who understand the humanities and humanists who understand technology.  When Steve Jobs, who attended but dropped out of a small liberal arts college, was asked what was the most important course he took in college, he said it was a course on calligraphy. His knowledge of calligraphy enabled him to design a keyboard for the Macintosh computer, which distinguishes it from its competitors. When unveiling a new edition of iPad, Steve Jobs said:  It is in Apple’s DNA that technology is married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yield us the results that make our hearts sing. Mark Zuckerberg was a psychology major at Harvard but he also dropped out of college. Mark has said that:  Facebook is as much about psychology and sociology as it is about technology. I think I have made my point. What is changing the world is not technology alone but innovators and entrepreneurs who have been able to marry technology with design, psychology and sociology. WHY STUDY HISTORY? When parents ask me what their children should study if they aspire to join our foreign service, I tell them that it doesn’t really matter but I hope some of our diplomats would have studied history.  Ignorance of history can get you into trouble and the knowledge of history can empower you. A Singapore developer had secured a site in Hanoi for development and was confronted by protesting Vietnamese veterans when the developer had wanted to demolish the prison standing on it.  The prison had been built by the French. During the long colonial rule, many Vietnamese freedom fighters had been imprisoned there, and some were tortured and killed.  To these Vietnamese veterans, the prison was sacred territory. In the end, a compromise was arrived at and a section of the prison has been preserved and turned into a museum. As Chairman at the National Heritage Board for nine years, one of my initiatives was to put up markers to honour great men and women who had visited Singapore during their lifetimes.  The first marker was to honour the great Polish-British writer, Joseph Conrad. A British merchant Seaman before becoming a writer, Singapore was his base as he worked on ships which sailed between Singapore and the Indonesian archipelago and the island of Borneo.  The success of this first marker encouraged me to put up markers to honour Ho Chi Minh, Jose Rizal, Deng Xiaoping and Jawaharlal Nehru. Our gestures have touched the hearts of the leaders and people of their countries.  In diplomacy, I have learned that, as human beings, we think with both our heads and our hearts. WHY STUDY LITERATURE? One of the subjects I studied for my O-levels in 1955 was Literature. 63 years later, I consider the study of Literature one of the best investments I have made.  Through Literature, I acquired a love of books and the joy of reading. Reading is an educational, joyful and liberating experience. You are transported from your circumstances, no matter how difficult and challenging, to another world, another time and another civilisation.  Reading is the key that unlocks the door to the treasury of the world. At the inaugural Book Summit, held in Washington, I was moved by the testimonies of several famous American writers who said that reading had saved their lives.  Reading literature helps you to think, write and speak clearly. Clarity of thought and expression is a virtue which should be cultivated.  Reading literature gives one a better understanding of human nature and the complexity of the human condition. It makes one less judgmental and more sympathetic. Literature complements non-fiction in helping us to understand another country and its people. In the case of Singapore, we should encourage our students, whether they are studying literature or not, to read the works of our poets, playwrights and authors.  I am an admirer of our poets, Edwin Thumboo, Lee Tzu Pheng and Leong Liew Geok. My favourite playwrights are Kuo Pao Kun, Robert Yeo, Haresh Sharma and Alfian Sa’at. I recommend the short stories and novels of Goh Poh Seng, Lim Chor Pee, Catherine Lim, Suchen Christine Lim, Philip Jeyaretnam, Simon Tay and Meira Chand. CASE FOR THE HUMANITIES The fourth industrial revolution has not made the study of the humanities irrelevant.  We should study the humanities because it will help us to think analytically, to write clearly and to speak persuasively. Apart from acquiring domain knowledge in the law, my legal education taught me how to think analytically and how to communicate my thoughts coherently, clearly and persuasively, both orally and in writing.  Norman Augustine, the former CEO of Lockheed Martin, when asked what was the most important qualification for advancement in his company, said that it was the ability to express one’s thought clearly in writing. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos requires his senior executives to submit written memoranda for their meetings. If proposing a new product or strategy, the memo must take the form of a press release. It must use simple, jargon-free language so that a lay person can understand it. My good friend, Professor Lily Kong, the President-elect of SMU, has written that:  It is in studying the humanities that we learn about humanity, or what it means to be human, in all its beauty and all its foibles. “Through literature and history, we see, for example, the martyrdom of self-sacrificing leaders as much as we see the viciousness of ambition. We gain insights into what it means to have a kindred spirit but also a cruel enemy. We witness the tenderness of human love, the pain of loss and the joy of reunion.”  “In an age of hyper-technology, all the more reason why we need the humanities – to remind us of the glory and frailty of humanity, to retell the meaning of being human … Where robots can dispense medicines, and chatbots replace human conversations, the jobs that will withstand the fourth industrial revolution are precisely the ones that require an understanding of human nature and a reliance on human empathy.” What we should aspire for is holistic education. We want our humanists to understand technology and our technologists to understand the humanities. An education in the humanities train us to think, write and speak clearly.  As long as we are human beings, the humanities will always be at the heart of civilisation.  Professor Tommy Koh is Ambassador-at-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Centre for International Law of NUS, and Special Adviser to the Institute of Policy Studies.

Even police intervention could not guarantee her safety if she remained. Madam Tamilvaannii already had obtained a Personal Protection Order against her abusive husband – it allowed the couple to live in the same home but separate rooms. Still, officers responding to her call advised her to leave for her own good. “What if he stabs me to death after the police leave?” she thought to herself. So in the middle of the night, she and her 18-year-old daughter Vinothinnii found themselves on the streets. That was when Mdm Vaannii saw the true value of being a homeowner in a new light: It wasn’t just a roof over her head, or a place to decorate as she liked. It was about having a haven where nobody could turf her or her children out. Said the 46-year-old:  I felt the pain of (having to leave). I saw that I must have my own home. But it was to take eight years of anxiety as a single mother, and the unexpected boon of a second chance, before she found that security for her children, with assistance from the Housing and Development Board (HDB). SO NEAR, YET SO FAR The night she was chased out, Mdm Vaannii sought shelter with relatives. And so began a “very, very tough” transition from a full-time housewife to a sole breadwinner. When her divorce was granted in 2011, her son went with her ex-husband, while she gained custody of her two daughters. To make ends meet, she started working two shifts as a healthcare assistant. In urgent need of housing, she rented a four-room flat on the open market for about S$2,200 a month – a steep price given their financial situation. It was a decision she made “in a rush”, because her daughters were in schools near the flat in Bukit Panjang. And, she thought, it would only be for a short while because they had something better to look forward to: She had applied successfully for a new flat under a 2012 Sale of Balance Flats exercise. But then, she was dealt another blow by her ex-husband: He refused to declare that he would not buy a subsidised flat within three years of their divorce. At the time, only one party of a divorced couple could buy or own a subsidised flat within those first three years. The policy has since been lifted as of March 6, 2018, to help divorcees with children through an “already difficult period of transition”. But back then, her ex-husband’s intransigence dashed her hopes. Her daughters’ entreaties on her behalf could not move him, and her application had to be cancelled. “If anything happens to me, where are they going to go?” fretted the “very disappointed” and “lost” mother. FROM FOUR-ROOM TO TWO-ROOM FLAT After over a year of renting, her savings were running low, even with her 40-per-cent share of the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial four-room flat in 2012. That and her S$900 monthly salary as a patient care assistant in a polyclinic would not cover both the rent and her daughters’ education, as well as their living expenses, for long. So in May 2012, the family applied for a public rental flat from HDB. While the policy then generally debarred people from applying within 30 months of selling their HDB flat, the housing authority looks at applicants’ needs and options on a case-by-case basis. In Mdm Vaannii’s case, she was assessed to be financially unable to buy a flat and without other options – and so the requirement was waived. They were allocated a rental flat in December. Her elder daughter, Ms Vinothinnii, who is now 26, recalls the day she first saw their current two-room rental flat in Clementi. It was a reality check after staying in a four-room flat with her own bedroom. We walked in, and I just sat in a corner, with my hands on my head. \"How small it was. How were we going to live here?” she thought. She remembers that they cried as they packed their belongings, such as photo albums and soft toys, for storage in a warehouse. For Mdm Vaannii, having to put away items of sentimental value, chiefly two boxes of saris, was the most painful part of the move. “All of the saris have meaning,” she said. “Most of them my father bought for me.” Still, though they felt as if they were in limbo over the next five years, they made do with the temporary home they had. And in early 2016, it seemed like things might look up when Ms Vinothinnii began working full-time as an operations manager, and could help with the bills. The snag: Their monthly rental, which was pegged to household income, was adjusted from S$275 to S$495 after she was a year into her job. The trouble was that a chunk of her pay of S$2,500 a month was going to her part-time studies at the Singapore Institute of Management. The rent increase wasn’t something they could afford. Ms Vinothinnii even considered splitting up the family and moving to a relative’s home, in the hopes the rent would remain as it was. But the idea and the uncertainty of their situation affected her mother so much, that she decided it was time to try again to own their own home, and apply for a flat jointly with her mum. “I always wanted a house under her own name,” she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A FRESH START, AND HAPPINESS The turning point in the family’s search for a permanent home came not quite in the way they had expected. While they were submitting a Sale of Balance Flats application in November 2016, an HDB officer suggested to Mdm Vaannii that she apply for a flat under the newly-minted Fresh Start Housing Scheme. The scheme is aimed at families with children below the age of 16, who are living in public rental flats and have owned subsidised housing previously. It provides them with a chance to own a home again – specifically, two-room flats with flexible leases ranging between 45 and 65 years, which are more affordable than standard two-room flats with 99-year leases. It was a significant opportunity for the family because of their tight financial situation. The flat would also come with a grant of up to S$35,000. And so, in December, Mdm Vaannii applied for the scheme with her two daughters, one of whom – Ms Visalini – was 15 at the time. Within a month, the family received a letter from the HDB: Their Sale of Balance Flats application was unsuccessful because their balloted queue position was beyond the available flat supply. But the Fresh Start application went through. Three months later, they received the official letter of approval. Mdm Vaannii could proceed to apply for a flat – and be a homeowner again. Said her elder daughter: “When she got accepted under Fresh Start, she was the happiest woman.” HELP TO MAKE A DREAM COME TRUE But she had lived with uncertainty for so long that, even amid her joy, Mdm Vaannii could not quite shake off the feeling of disbelief. Not even when they were choosing their two-room flat. I kept asking, ‘Are you sure I’m choosing my flat? Am I really going to buy a flat?’ Fresh Start applicants must meet a set of criteria to “ensure that they’re committed and ready for homeownership”, according to the HDB. They must, for example, qualify for a Letter of Social Assessment from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which would assess their family stability, ability to manage their finances, and the children’s regularity of school attendance. Mdm Vaannii made the cut. Hers is one of 70 families who have found a home under the scheme so far. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n And for her to make the most of this “dream come true”, HDB and MSF officers were on hand to offer assistance. As she put it, “From nowhere, someone popped up and said, ‘Hey, I’m here to help.’” For example, HDB senior estate manager Johnson Lim helped her to work out her housing budget, which consisted mainly of her Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings, an HDB concessionary loan (subject to credit assessment), and the Fresh Start Housing Grant, where of which S$20,000 would be credited to her CPF account upfront. “One of the key aspects of this scheme is financial sustainability,” Mr Lim said. “What I try to do is understand the applicants’ situation and come up with a housing plan according to their circumstances.” The flat cost Mdm Vaannii about S$133,000, after incorporating a reduced resale levy of S$16,700 based on the 60-year lease period. And she opted for a flat with all the finishes, which will help her save on renovation costs. As they waited for the day they could finally move in, her family were hardly able to contain themselves. They went for drives in her brother-in-law’s van to see their new block in Bukit Batok take shape. “Every week, without fail,” said Ms Vinothinnii with a smile. “They have to see whether the house is okay, if the construction is okay. They even inspected the car parks.” HOME SWEET HOME, FINALLY When it came time to collect her new set of keys, Mdm Vaannii was visibly nervous – but above all, deeply moved. As were her daughters. Ms Vinothinnii burst into tears as she walked down the corridor to their flat. “Tears of joy,” she managed to say. “The struggle has finally paid off.” With her family cheering behind her, Mdm Vaannii opened the door of her new home. Bare as it was, excited squeals filled every corner as the family flooded into the flat. Taking a moment for herself, Mdm Vaannii stood by the window to admire the greenery outside. “I’m starting anew – after a very long time, having our own home,” she said, teary-eyed.  I’m so happy. No words to talk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In fact, this will be their home for at least 20 years, the minimum occupation period under the Fresh Start scheme. Ms Visalini, now 17, is looking forward to holding family gatherings here, while her older sister is chewing over renovation ideas. Their mother is planning on doing one thing first: Moving her saris out of the warehouse for good. “There’s a storeroom (here), so we can put a cupboard in there,” she said. “I’ll hang the saris. Only the saris.” In the place she can finally call her own home, sweet home.

It's opening its first outlet overseas in Osaka on Saturday, with plans to expand to Tokyo in 2019. With interest from Russia, England, Indonesia, Philippines and more, Maki-San’s decision to venture into Japan – a market saturated with sushi chains – may turn heads. Mr Wong and his partner, Mr Omar Marks, who co-founded the food chain, have been set on Japan ever since Maki-San’s new franchise owner, Mr Yamamoto Masayoshi, approached them. Mr Wong said it “felt like we managed to sell ice to the Eskimos”. Mr Masayoshi said: “I was looking for unique concepts to bring to Japan when I came across this brand. Most sushi in Japan uses very traditional ingredients.” Maki-San stood out for using “special ingredients from around the world, not just typical Japanese ingredients”. Maki-San has three defining features: untraditional ingredients, make-it-yourself sushi and loud, colourful marketing with an affinity for social media.  In its brightly coloured stores, customers make their own rolls from ingredients including spicy chicken jerky and tempura mushrooms, and sit on pastel stools. The chain has enjoyed marked success with its concept, especially with a younger crowd, with 18 stores in Singapore. In most sushi restaurants in Japan, Mr Wong said, “everything is already pre-configured, you already know what to expect.” Maki-San is where  “consumers have the chance to customise their sushi to reflect their taste buds\". He is convinced that \"it’s quite a safe bet\". But he is not dismissing the risks. “It’s always a different market. Things that register with customers here may not register there,” Mr Wong said. To cater to the Japanese palate, Maki-San tweaked their menu and recipes. The menu at its Osaka outlet will have a menu that is about 80 per cent similar to the Singapore version. Following taste tests in Osaka, the company has developed a better sense of Japanese customers’ taste profiles, including, notably, an aversion to salted egg yolk and chimichurri. Recipes for staple items will differ between countries too. The Japanese outlet’s sweet plum sauce, tartar sauce, and yuzu sesame sauce have been tweaked to reflect the differences in consumers’ taste profiles. The sweet plum sauce, for example, is sourer in Osaka. “We’ve seen other shops that have gone through the fad-ish period. A couple months after they open, sales dip quite a bit.” Maki-San has avoided the trap in Singapore so far. Mr Wong believes the company has shown the concept has a lasting appeal. He said, “We look at ourselves as a brand that’s here to stay.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/makisan-new-outlet-japan-osaka-10528166"}, {"datetime": "13 Jul 2018 10:58PM", "tags": ["Singapore University of Social Sciences"], "author": "", "title": "SUSS scheme rewards part-time students free modules if they marry or have children", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) is offering its part-time adult students free modules if they get married or have children during their study.  The Marriage and Baby Bonus Scheme, the university said in a press release on Friday (Jul 13), is in support of \"Singapore's continued focus in encouraging marriage and parenthood\".  To be eligible, the student must also be a Singaporean or Singaporean Permanent Resident and has registered his or her marriage, or the child's birth or adoption, on or after Jul 23.  If a candidate qualifies either through marriage or by having children, he or she will be able to redeem two bonus modules of five credit units each, or one 10-credit module.  The scheme is open to all SUSS students enrolled in its part-time conferred programmes, including undergraduate, law and post graduate programmes.  Students on SUSS or company sponsorships are not able to qualify for the scheme.

The Singapore U-19s suffered heavy losses to Thailand, Indonesia and Laos, earning just one point in five matches.  The 5-0 thrashing to Laos was what drew attention to the issue, with former Singapore international R Sasikumar telling Channel NewsAsia earlier this week that it was an \"embarrassment\" and a \"major issue\".  FAS had said in a press release before the tournament that the team were missing some of their better players, but still had \"adequate experience\". On Friday, Fox Sports Asia reported that the Laos team had been put together just five weeks before the start of the tournament.  Queries sent by Channel NewsAsia to FAS at the start of the week have gone unanswered so far.  Steve Darby, who has had stints with Singapore Premier League club Home United and the Laos national team, said he was surprised\" that Servais was allowed to leave.  \"If you are contracted to have a major role in a team, such as head coach, the professional thing to do is to complete the task or resign and undertake the other task,\" the 63-year-old told Channel NewsAsia.  \"If there was plenty of time before the AFF tournament then I can see the benefits to the individual coach and possible benefits to FAS if he completed a report and shared it with the local coaches. \"However, the timing appears to be the key issue here ... I am surprised that permission was given as it must have an effect on the U-19 team. If it didn’t then he wasn’t being effective as a coach.   \"You can’t have it both ways accept praise for success and avoid blame for defeat.\" Aide Iskandar, who was previously in the Singapore national setup as head coach of the Young Lions and Singapore U-23 team, said he was appalled by it.  In a Facebook post on Thursday, Aide wrote that \"a dignified coach will stick with his team whether the team wins, lose or draw through any competition and his tenure as a coach\".  \"When you make a commitment to develop young players, please do it with your fullest commitment and integrity! Don't just do it for your own personal development to get somewhere! \"I may not be the best person to comment but at least I have the integrity to do my best for the youths during my time as a youth coach,\" Aide added.   SERVAIS SHOULDN'T BE BLAMED FOR RESULTS But one coach said he was puzzled by the negative reaction towards the whole development and said he was disappointed by it.  Alex Weaver, who led Warriors FC to the S.League title in 2015 and is now with Switzerland's FC Lausanne-Sport, said it was imperative to look at the big picture.  \"It's about asking the question, 'What is best for Singapore football medium-long term? Is it an under-19 tournament now or what Robbie can give to these players and coaches for the rest of their careers as a result of what he gains from working at a World Cup?,\" asked Englishman Weaver. He's still a Singapore coach working for the FAS to improve the development for the young players, he's going to come back and share his experience (with the rest).\" \"It's the World Cup, where the best players are competing. he is able to bring all that back and share that knowledge and experience which will benefit them for the rest of the career. But I think people other than FAS and Sablon are looking as though it will only benefit Robbie Servais, as if it's some vacation he's taking.\"  Weaver added that the poor results in the tournament should not be pinned on Servais solely. \"It's not because Robbie went to work with Australia in the World Cup. It's because of what happened seven, eight years ago - youth development is a whole process that takes a lot of time,\" Weaver explained. \"He's not a club coach where he gets to spend every day with the players ... the quality he gets to work now is the result of what the previously technical director and youth coaches were doing years ago. An U-19 coach can only influence so much within a 12-month period.\"  The questions that should be asked then, according to Weaver, is why did FAS fail to publicise about having a coach who was going to work at the World Cup. \"Knowing the bad reputation it has at the moment, which for me is unfortunate, I would have been all over this,\" Weaver offered.  \"Maybe if they had done that, it might have influenced people's opinions. The fact that they didn't say anything maybe has played a part ... they should be proud of him.\"  That thought was echoed by Darby as well.  \"I agree development is long term. But it is measured by results of teams or individual players progressing to higher levels - neither seems to be happening at the moment in Singapore.\"  \"I would be interested to see or hear the rationale behind releasing the coach with the AFF tournament so close,\" said Darby. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/under-19-football-coaches-question-robbie-servais-commitment-fas-10528158"}, {"datetime": "13 Jul 2018 08:39PM", "tags": ["Fulham", "football", "Ben Davis"], "author": "Nigel Chin", "title": "Singapore's Ben Davis signs professional deal with newly promoted Premier League club Fulham", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singaporean footballer Benjamin Davis has signed the first professional deal of his career with newly promoted Premier League club Fulham FC.  Davis, 17, joined Fulham on a two-year scholarship deal in July last year.  However, his performances for the Fulham Under-18 side were so impressive that the club decided to hand him a new deal.  He is the first Singaporean to sign a professional contract with a top-tier English club.

She is married to a logistics coordinator, who also works in Singapore, but the couple had a strained relationship as Dieza was having an affair with another man, known only as Raymond. Dieza committed the offences on Apr 11 this year, at the condominium unit her Australian employer lived in. She was looking after her employer's son, who was just over a year old at that time, when she got into a heated argument with Raymond during a video call on Facebook between 2pm and 3pm. She then decided to record videos of herself abusing the boy - who cannot be named due to a gag order - in order to show Raymond what she was capable of when angry, court documents said. The boy was lying on the bed getting ready for a nap when Dieza placed her mobile phone on the side of the bed with the camera angled at him and started recording. The recording, which was 1 minute 34 seconds long, showed Dieza press the boy's face into the mattress, smother him with a pillow and shake him. She also pulled and lifted the boy up by his hair, and threw him against a pillow. Throughout the ordeal, the boy screamed and cried in pain. Later that day, Dieza was with the boy in the kitchen when she again decided to record herself abusing the child. This time, Dieza grabbed the boy's arm and used the broad side of a kitchen knife to repeatedly smack him on his buttocks. The video clip was 35 seconds long, in which the boy was screaming and crying.

Dieza's husband later called the police, stating that he believed his wife was not in a position to look after a child. He said: \"My wife Leslie Ann is working here as a domestic helper. She is taking care of a kid. With her state of mind, she is not in the right capacity to take care of a kid.\" He added that Dieza told him that she had just been scolded by her employer and \"she can't take it\". \"I am worried for the safety of the kid and also worried of losing my job here because of her,\" he said. Dieza was arrested at the condominium that night, and the child was taken to hospital for a check-up. The boy had a 1cm-long abrasion on his foot and two small old scabs on his back.

Francis Lim Boon Liang hired the Indonesian maid, then 23, in November 2016. The young domestic worker, who cannot be named due to a gag order, stayed with Lim, his wife and two children. Later that month, Lim saw that the maid was alone in the kitchen one night. He approached her and asked if she could kiss him, court documents said. She refused. Lim, who was topless, lifted his shorts and exposed himself to the maid. He then asked her to perform a sexual act on him, but she refused twice. However, Lim persisted and she eventually relented as she thought that she had no choice but to comply. This all happened while Lim's son was in the living room and his daughter was in her room. The victim felt \"angry, helpless and embarrassed\". However, she did not report the matter to the police immediately as she still respected Lim as her employer and did not want to cause any problems with Lim or his wife. Lim committed the offence again in December, this time at his mother's house. His maid was there to help with household chores as his mother's domestic helper had been sent back to the maid agency.  On Dec 3, 2016, while the victim was alone in the kitchen, Lim approached her from behind and molested her while kissing her cheeks. He then took her right hand and guided it into his shorts despite her clear refusal to do so. While this was happening, Lim's mother was in her room, while his son was in another bedroom. VICTIM FLED TO THE MINISTRY OF MANPOWER After that incident, the victim could no longer bear what Lim had been doing to her. At about 10pm on Dec 4, 2016, while Lim's mother was sleeping, she fled the house and took a taxi to the Ministry of Manpower building. It was closed so she slept at a nearby bus stop until the next morning, when she reported the matter to the authorities.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Yi Ling on Friday asked for 12 months' jail, saying that there was skin-on-skin contact and an abuse of trust as he was her employer. The victim was in a vulnerable and powerless position, the prosecutor said, and it ended because the victim felt she had no choice but to run away. Defence lawyer Sunil Sudheesan asked for a sentence of around eight months' jail, saying that Lim had pleaded guilty and spared the victim the trauma of a trial. He said that there was \"sincere remorse\" in this case, and that Lim, who had a clean record, had acted out of character. The defence added that Lim was suffering from personal difficulties at that time - his brother died in June that year and his father died in November 2016. District Judge Marvin Bay sentenced Lim to 11 months' jail for two charges of outrage of modesty, saying that his acts were \"grossly intrusive\".

In the first quarter, demand increased primarily due to public sector demand (and) some pick-up in private sector construction,” an official said at a briefing to announce first-quarter GDP figures.  “Taken together, we think the construction sector will start to bottom up and we should see a pick-up in activities towards the latter half of this year or 2019.”  This could, however, change with the surprise property curbs announced on Jul 5.  “There are signs that it is bottoming out because of the rebound in the property market but now, the cooling measures will likely have a dampening effect on the sector,” Nomura economist Brian Tan said.  “I’d remain very cautious on construction as a source of growth.”  Aimed at cooling the market and keeping “price increases in line with economic fundamentals”, the Government hiked the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates and tightened loan-to-value (LTV) limits on residential property purchases.  Developers were also slapped with a non-remissible five per cent ABSD when they purchase en bloc properties for redevelopment, alongside a 10-percentage-point increase in the waivable ABSD to 25 per cent. Described by some analysts as “heavy-handed”, the cooling measures are seen having the largest impact on the en bloc market and the private residential market. The resurgence in the former was supposed to be a boost to the construction sector when new condominium projects get underway. “We had initially expected the construction sector to potentially bottom by end of 2018 but given that the recent cooling measures in the form of a hike to the ABSD and LTV tightening is likely to dampen the private residential market sentiments and activity in the near term, there may not be light at the end of the tunnel this year for the construction sector’s growth,” said OCBC Bank’s head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling. But observers are less certain about when the impact could kick in, citing projects that may be coming on stream soon.  “Don’t forget there were already deals done from all the en bloc activities. These construction projects are not the kind of things that you start and stop at a whim so it may take some time before it filters in,” said Mr Tan.  “But it might still put the brakes on the en bloc hopefuls.” Maybank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye wrote in a note that “severe” property measures are “hurting the construction outlook” though the sector is still likely to get some reprieve from the strong en bloc sales to date and rising value of contracts awarded. To be sure, there is one economist with a contrarian view.  Mr Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank, thinks the latest cooling measures will not cause a dramatic slowdown in construction activity. “Whatever that’s underway, developers will go ahead to finish it,” he said. “What the measures might do is cause a reconsideration among developers when it comes to pricing for land bids, but what it does not do is give cause for those who have already bought the land to hold back on construction.”  As for the impact on new projects, he reckoned: “The en bloc activity may not be as frantic but you may want to bear in mind that a lot of the impact would be around pricing potential. Developers and owners looking to encash will be calibrating their expectations and a deal may still go through.  “My proposition is that the cooling measures may not translate into an impact because some of that could be adjusted from a price perspective.”  The Government keeping residential land supply in the second half of 2018 on par with that in the first half also means that “public projects can be adjusted to pick up some of the buffer”.  Lastly, with the significant declines seen last year, it “must take something jarring” to worsen the year-on-year figures for the sector, added Mr Varathan. Looking ahead, the economist expects contraction in the construction sector to continue easing to negative three to four per cent, from its current four to five per cent declines. “This kind of gradual recovery is not outlandish to expect,” he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/property-cooling-measures-singapore-construction-sector-economy-10527106"}, {"datetime": "13 Jul 2018 02:32PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Former physics teacher who had indecent relationship with student, 15, sentenced to 16 months' jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: A former physics teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with his student, then aged 15, was sentenced to 16 months' jail on Friday (Jul 13). The 34-year-old, who cannot be named due to a gag order, was the girl's physics teacher when she was in Secondary 1 and 2. The girl and the school cannot be named due to a court order. According to court documents, the teenager was infatuated with the teacher and worked harder for his subject. She also told him that she wanted to become a physics teacher and asked for his advice. Sometime in 2015, the teenager contacted the teacher via his handphone number, which had been given to all students for the arranging of physics consultations. The pair started texting each other via WhatsApp and later video-called each other using Skype. Sometime before the final term examination in 2015, the conversation became more intimate and had sexual overtones. After the exams, the teacher sent an explicit text message to the student. Initially, she did not know how to react, but she played along and they started exchanging sexual messages. During a video call, the teacher asked to see the girl in her physical education (PE) T-shirt. He admitted that he liked to see students in their PE T-shirts as it \"turned him on\". HE STARTED GIVING HER TUITION, WENT OUT AFTER In June 2016, the teacher started to give tuition to the student and her sister at their home every week. In September 2016, they went out for meals after tuition on some occasions. The teacher drove the student to East Coast Park. While inside the car, he would behave intimately with her. He also kissed and licked her neck and ear twice at the park. Investigations revealed that the girl had never had a romantic relationship before this. Despite feeling \"scared and uncomfortable\", the girl allowed the teacher to carry out various acts with her, including kissing and touching. The teacher revealed that he had no feelings for the girl. On Sep 7, 2016, the teacher gave tuition to the girl at her home. Sometime after noon, the teacher kissed the girl in his car and tried to pull her hand towards his crotch, but she pulled her hand away. Later that evening, he told the girl that he had a room available and hinted that he wanted her to perform a sexual act on him. The next day, he picked her up and drove around to different places, including his flat. However, the girl did not want to enter his flat and they left, ending up at Pasir Ris Park. A police officer on patrol saw the girl seated on the teacher's lap, holding hands, in Pasir Ris Park and alerted the girl's parents. The girl's father then lodged a police report. The teacher asked the girl to delete their WhatsApp chat log, and he also did the same. Even so, some of the deleted chat messages on the teacher's phone were recovered through forensic examination. On Friday, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt sentenced the teacher to 16 months' jail for three charges of committing or trying to commit indecent acts with a child or young person. Three other charges were taken into consideration. As a first-time offender, he could have been jailed five years and fined up to S$10,000. Repeat offenders face a jail term of up to seven years and a maximum S$20,000 fine. The prosecution had asked for a 10-month jail sentence for each charge, arguing that the teacher used the victim's infatuation with him and trust in him to exploit her sexually.   While they did not have sexual intercourse, he groomed her sexually and would have continued if the police did not intervene, the prosecutor said in court. The judge agreed that the teacher had exploited the girl.

He said Singapore is fortunate to be strategically located in a region with strong growth potential. \"For Asia to continue growing, the region must invest in meeting its infrastructure needs,\" he said. \"We need to crowd in private capital for more sources to accelerate infrastructure development in the region.\" Referring the setting up of the Infrastructure Asia Office in April this year, Mr Heng said Singapore will be able to harness the collective network of public sector agencies, private sector firms and key stakeholders to explore better ways to meet Asia's infrastructure needs.  Another example of this will be the Asia-Singapore Infrastructure Roundtable which will be held in October. As for enterprise financing, Mr Heng said Singapore is positioning itself as a global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise development. Mr Heng gave the example of how the Monetary Authority of Singapore has revised regulations to facilitate the growth of centre capitalists, and how the government is working with the industry to establish private market funding platforms for companies to gain better access to investors. \"As a major financial centre, with a wide range of financial institutions providing seed funding, Singapore is a strong base to serve the needs of innovative enterprises and to seed the growth of the next-generation of Asian growth companies\" said Mr Heng.

One of these is Captain Yeap Wei Jiun, the Officer Commanding of the 150 Squadron, who has been based at Cazaux Air Base for two-and-a-half years. \"Despite the language differences, we adapted very well,\" he said. \"The Singaporean community here form a tight network with one another, so we get together over the weekends, like for example (for the) World Cup, we go to each others' houses to view the World Cup together.\" Dignitaries at Cazaux were also given a sneak preview of the flypast which they will be doing. \"We cooperate on a number of advanced projects, in terms of defence technology, especially where the strengths of the French, the defence ministry as well as their defence companies, as well as in areas like cybersecurity,\" he said. \"So I would say it's multi-faceted. It's been a very rich, very productive relationship and I think it's because we share perspectives on both of our countries of liberty, equality, fraternity, as well as shared values about the world that we live in.\" Also as part of the celebrations, items from Singapore and France were placed inside a time capsule, which will only be opened 20 years later.

This comes in below the median forecast of 4 per cent in a Reuters poll of 12 economists, and is down from the year-on-year growth of 4.3 per cent in the first quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, the economy expanded at a slower pace of 1 per cent during the April to June period, underperforming expectations of 1.2 per cent in the Reuters survey. This is also lower than the quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.5 per cent in the previous three months. For the second quarter, the manufacturing sector grew by 8.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis, easing from the 9.7 per cent growth in the previous three months. MTI said all clusters within the sector expanded during the quarter, with the electronics and biomedical manufacturing clusters contributing the most. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, the sector shrank marginally by 0.1 per cent, a reversal from the previous quarter’s 21.3 per cent growth. The services producing industries also moderated; year-on-year growth came in at 3.4 per cent, down from 4.0 per cent in the first quarter, with support coming primarily from the finance and insurance, and wholesale and retail trade sectors. Quarter-on-quarter, the services sector, which  makes up two-thirds of the economy, grew by 2.5 per cent. This marked a turnaround from the contraction of 1.4 per cent in the preceding quarter. The construction sector remained an underperformer with a contraction of 4.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, extending the 5.2 per cent decline in the previous quarter, weighed down primarily by continued weakness in private sector construction activities. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, the sector shrank by 14.6 per cent, reversing the 0.9 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Mr Jeff Ng, chief economist at Continuum Economics, said the lower-than-expected GDP estimates for the second quarter pointed to sluggish growth in domestic-oriented services. While growth remained supported by both manufacturing and services, there was “little broadening of growth” in the services sector where momentum continued to be supported by wholesale and retail trade, as well as financial services, he said. Meanwhile, expectations for manufacturing’s growth pace to taper could be materialising, said Nomura economist Brian Tan.  The sector, which accounts for one-fifth of Singapore’s economy, enjoyed a growth spurt last year on the back of an explosion in semiconductor manufacturing. Analysts have long expected growth to start moderating this year. “I think we are starting to get that moderation coming in and I suspect growth could slow more noticeably because of the very unfavourable base effects in the second half,” said Mr Tan.  “By extension, this will mean a fall in the year-on-year growth rate.” TRADE TENSIONS AMONG DOWNSIDE RISKS AHEAD In May, MTI narrowed the forecast range for Singapore’s annual growth to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent – a range that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reiterated earlier this month as it said the economy is expected to remain on a “steady expansion path” despite headwinds from trade tensions. Prior to that in April, the central bank tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years. Moving forward, analysts expect escalating trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies to be one of the downside risks for Singapore.  “The risk that we get more tariffs is substantial and cannot be dismissed as we get into the United States’ midterm elections in November,” said Mr Tan. “If things get more political in the US, there is a risk that more (tariffs) get announced.”  The impact on Singapore would come from supply chain risks, according to Mr Ng.  “Singapore is closely tied to global and regional supply chains. A 10 per cent drop in China or US imports will decrease Singapore exports by about 1 to 2 percentage points. This should weigh on both domestic exports and re-exports,” he said. In addition, the latest property cooling measures may also limit the upsides to near-term domestic growth, Mr Ng added. While noting these downside risks, Maybank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye wrote that “MTI’s advance GDP estimate tends to be more conservative”. Hence, they are expecting an upgrade in the final second-quarter GDP estimates and services growth. They are also holding on to their full-year growth forecast of 3.5 per cent, given how first-half GDP is running slightly above four per cent and trade-related impact may not yet be felt in the third quarter. The advance GDP estimates are computed largely from data in the first two months of the quarter - in this case, April and May. They are intended as an early indication of GDP growth in the quarter, and are subject to revision when more comprehensive data become available, said MTI. MTI will release the second-quarter Economic Survey of Singapore in August, which will include performance by sectors, sources of growth, inflation, employment and productivity.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-gdp-economy-slows-q2-mti-advance-estimates-10525080"}]
