This will be done through methods such as joint initiatives and immersion programmes, under the three agreements signed between Singapore and France on Thursday (Jul 12), which are aimed at deepening economic and innovation linkages between both countries. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing described the partnerships as being crucial in promoting openness, amidst the backdrop of increasing protectionism and global sentiments to look inwards. “We must make sure that we have this network to allow our people and our start-ups the same opportunities to access the global network. The pace of innovation has intensified, the kind of reach that today’s technology can allow is much different from what we used to be able to do in the past,” he said. “So we should seize all these opportunities to plug ourselves into these networks around the world to further our cause to create better jobs for our people and more opportunities for our businesses.” Mr Chan said these global linkages would enable Singapore companies and workers to learn from expertise from around the world and bolster their efforts to internationalise. He was speaking at the signing of the Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) between Enterprise Singapore, the Economic Development Board and French institutions during his visit to Paris. Mr Jonathan Lim, Enterprise Singapore’s director for Global Innovation Alliance, said: “The partnerships aim to boost Singapore’s startup ecosystem by promoting exchange between French and Singaporean startups, especially in deeptech. Similarly, we hope to establish more collaborations between French enterprises and Singaporean start-ups to co-create and co-innovate solutions for Europe and Asia.” All in, the deals signed is part of the broader effort to establish and expand the Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) programmes in Paris. The alliance was launched last year to strengthen Singapore's links to innovation hubs around the world, create more opportunities for Singaporeans students, entrepreneurs and businesses to connect and collaborate with their overseas counterparts and gain overseas experience. While in Paris, Mr Chan also visited start-up campus Station F to better understand the vibrant innovation culture in France. The visit, along with the agreements signed, underscored Singapore's commitment to deepen innovation links with France, as part of the France-Singapore Year of Innovation 2018, where both countries will intensify exchanges and collaborations in the innovation space. Mr Chan Ih Ming, director of the Global Innovation Alliance Programme Office, said: “France has a rich history of innovation, a tradition that is further bolstered by the French government’s drive to create a more innovative economy during this Year of Innovation.  \"Welcoming Paris into the GIA network will not only strengthen partnerships between French and Singaporean enterprises, but also drive the growth of our startup ecosystems, and benefit both our economies.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-and-france-ink-deals-to-deepen-economic-innovation-10525658"}, {"datetime": "13 Jul 2018 06:24AM", "tags": ["e-commerce", "Sea", "Shopee", "online shopping"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "E-commerce site Shopee to start charging transaction fees from August", "content": " SINGAPORE: Shopee, the e-commerce site by Singapore tech firm Sea, will begin charging sellers a 1 per cent transaction fee for all successful orders beginning next month. An email was sent out on Wednesday (Jul 11) to notify users of this new charge. Details of what the transaction fee entails can also be found under Shopee's Help Centre section.  The company told Channel NewsAsia in a statement that the 1 per cent transaction fee is for processing and handling payments, and that Shopee remains a zero-commission platform. It is applicable to sellers based in Singapore from Aug 1, following on the heels of Taiwan last year. The fee will be applied on all successful transactions through bank transfers, credit card and Shopee Wallet payments, its website stated.  \"While the charging of transaction fees is an industry-wide standard, Shopee made sure to only introduce it at a point where we felt our users were ready,\" the company said. \"The move to introduce transaction fees at this point in time highlights our shift in focus from merely growing the platform to building a more sustainable e-commerce ecosystem for our users in the long run, and also further cements our position as an established e-commerce player in the market.\" It also emphasised its range of free services for sellers, including free listing and shipping. These have been \"very well received\" and there are no plans to stop them, it said. Shopee has more than 1.5 million users in Singapore, the company said.  Rival platforms, too, impose fees on sellers through a variety of methods. Qoo10, for instance, charged a range between 7 per cent and 12 per cent of the total transaction amount depending on the item's price and seller grade.

For the year ended Mar 31, the 20-year annualised rate of return - GIC’s most important benchmark - slipped to 3.4 per cent from 3.7 per cent a year ago, according to the latest annual report released on Friday (Jul 13). This marked the third consecutive year of decline since the return rate hit 4.9 per cent in FY2014/15. Nevertheless, GIC said this figure is above the global inflation rate and means that the international purchasing power of its reserves almost doubled during the 20-year timeframe. CEO Lim Chow Kiat said GIC’s 20-year annualised rate of return was fluctuating around 4 per cent before declining below that in recent years. This is due to years being dropped and added as its 20-year window rolls. “The high returns at the beginning of the tech bubble period (in the late 1990s) have dropped out,” he told reporters at a briefing, while adding that this effect could continue for a few more years and dampen the 20-year return. “We don’t know what year will come in (but) what we can do is to focus on our approach, which is to make sure our portfolio is robust, diversified and is able to hold through difficult environments.” In US dollar nominal terms, GIC’s portfolio returns were 5.9 per cent per annum over the last 20 years, slightly above the 5.7 per cent annualised return from its reference portfolio. The latter, made up of 65 per cent global equities and 35 per cent global bonds, refers to the risk that GIC can take to generate good long-term investment returns. Over the five- and 10-year periods, GIC saw annualised returns of 6.6 per cent and 4.6 per cent in US dollar nominal terms, respectively. These are lower than the reference portfolio’s 6.9 per cent return over a five-year period and 5.2 per cent over 10 years. This is due to how GIC’s portfolio has a smaller allocation to developed market equities than its reference portfolio, after lowering its exposure in recent years due to increasingly stretched valuations, said the FY2017/18 report. REMAIN ‘CAUTIOUS’ BUT READY FOR OPPORTUNITIES As at the end of March 2018, developed market equities accounted for 23 per cent of GIC’s portfolio, down from 27 per cent a year ago. This corresponded with a two-percentage-point increase in the allocation to nominal bonds and cash to 37 per cent – the highest level since GIC began issuing annual reports in 2008. It also increased its allocation to private equity from 9 per cent to 11 per cent. Emerging market equities, inflation-linked bonds and real estate form the other asset classes in GIC’s portfolio. Having a smaller portion of its portfolio in developed market equities is reflective of GIC’s “cautious stance” at a time when downside risks are building up and the risk-reward ratio is not as attractive, explained Mr Lim. The preservation of liquidity also means that the sovereign wealth fund will have “significant dry powder” in times of market volatility, he added.  Group chief investment officer Jeffrey Jaensubhakij noted that GIC “decided it is prudent to be more cautious” and “did some pruning of the portfolio” earlier this year even though global markets were little swayed by initial threats of trade tariffs then. “We like to prepare ahead so that when it comes to pass, we will already be prepared and if markets overreact, there may be opportunities to buy things that were otherwise not,” he said, while citing the example of Chinese A-shares which saw a sharp sell-off last month. “It was too expensive to buy but maybe, we can look at it now.” When asked how GIC views the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, Mr Lim described it as a “big concern”. “If it leads to more disruptions of supply chains and difficulties with inflation, this could cause a serious impact on financial markets. As a global investor, we wish not to see that happen.” Still, GIC is “pretty well prepared” given its diversified portfolio and cautious investment stance over the years. “Even if the frictions escalate further, I would expect our portfolio to hold up relatively well,” said the chief executive. Other downside risks shaping the challenging environment also include the increased risk of monetary policy tightening, elevated market volatility, underlying market vulnerabilities and most crucially, stretched valuations across a broad range of markets. “Stretched valuations is a big challenge because if you go in at a high price, the fundamentals need to be better than what the prices already reflect for you to make good money,” explained Mr Lim. “Being the manager of the country’s reserves, adopting a prudent approach is very important. The most important thing is to make sure that our portfolio is diversified and at the same time, maintain strong price discipline,” he added. Nevertheless, Mr Lim said GIC remains ready to capture “idiosyncratic opportunities” or “potential market dislocations”. For instance, it has set its sights on the technology sector, which has disrupted global economies and reshaped investment outcomes. Innovation in emerging markets, notably China and India, are where opportunities lie, the annual report said.  The real estate sector, where the Singapore sovereign wealth fund has been active in, also remains on the radar. As yields in traditional commercial assets like offices fall, GIC has turned to alternative real estate assets, such as student housing and rental apartment, said Dr Jaensubhakij. In January, it formed a joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and The Scion Group to acquire a student housing portfolio in the US for approximately US$1.1 billion (S$1.47 billion). It also partnered NOVA, a Shanghai-based property operator and investment manager, in May to set up a 4.3 billion yuan (S$904 million) rental apartment platform in China.  Noting that GIC has to be “alert and agile” in its portfolio mix given the challenging environment of low returns and high downside risks, Mr Lim said: “We are prepared for the uncertainty ahead and are committed to delivering steady long-term returns on the reserves placed under our management.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/gic-annualised-20-year-real-return-slips-10525598"}, {"datetime": "13 Jul 2018 06:17AM", "tags": ["Singapore property", "ABSD"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Singapore’s biggest developers see property market slowing after cooling measures", "content": " SINGAPORE: The local property market will see some slowing on the back of surprise cooling measures though a crash is unlikely, said the top executives from some of Singapore’s biggest developers.  However, the chief financial officers of GuocoLand Group and CapitaLand Group differed on whether the Government’s latest step, which involved tweaks to Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for both buyers and developers, was necessary.  Both CFOs were speaking at a panel discussion on Thursday (Jul 12) organised by OCBC as part of the bank’s Global Treasury Economic and Business Forum 2018. The session on trends and future of the real estate sector also had Mapletree Investments Group CFO Wong Mun Hoong, and was moderated by International Property Advisor’s CEO Ku Swee Yong.  When asked if the 5-percentage-point rise in ABSD for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying second and subsequent homes would deter buyers and trigger a crash in the market, the executives agreed that “crash is too strong a word” and it would be an unlikely scenario.  “It’s not the first time we are seeing ABSD being introduced … and when it was first introduced, there was obviously the same question but (the market) didn’t crash,” said GuocoLand Group CFO Richard Lai. “But what it did was slow the market.”  He reckoned that the latest slew of property curbs will have a similar effect though he was quick to add that the impact could be felt differently across different segments of the residential market.  While locals buying their first homes in the mass market segment could be little swayed by the ABSD hike, the high-end segment might be in for an initial “hold back to wait and see” reaction from investors. This is because most of them would be foreign buyers facing a higher ABSD rate of 20 per cent following the rule change on Jul 6, explained Mr Lai.  Still, it could be a “temporal” effect given the many factors that sway foreign investors’ appetite for property in Singapore, he added.  For one, the country’s status as a gateway city and merits like market transparency, mean that Singapore properties will continue to receive a fair share of interest from abroad. In addition, the increased ABSD rate of 20 per cent remains 10 percentage points lower than Hong Kong’s equivalent. “For someone from Hong Kong, he will have to ask whether he should get in now before it gets to 30 per cent.”  Meanwhile, the recent trend of capital flows back into the United States and other developed economies could be key.  “I think (the capital flight) will have a greater longer-term implication than the ABSD rule, which I think will have a definite impact but a temporal one,” said Mr Lai.  Echoing that, CapitaLand’s Group CFO Andrew Lim said “the word ‘crash’ is too strong”. But he described the recent housing curbs as a “fair” reaction from the Government given how the cooling of private property prices over a four-year period via the previous measures was “wiped out” in a short period.  Prices of private housing increased by 9.1 per cent since the trough in the second quarter of 2017, mostly offsetting the cumulative price decline of 11.6 per cent during the four-year period between mid-2013 and mid-2017.  “So I would say we are an architect of our own situation. The regulators have seen this threat and are trying to nip it in the bud in its infancy,” said Mr Lim.  He added that given how speculative demand “would rightly cause concerns”, the Government was making an early attempt “to manage what they believe or perceive to be an increase in speculation” in the local residential market.  \"On that basis, I suppose the reactions are a fair one,” Mr Lim added.  But his counterpart, Mr Lai, disagreed. Using the en bloc market as an example, the GuocoLand executive said more collective sale bids have closed without concluding a sale recently, alongside “some plateauing” in developers’ land price bids.  He added that the run-up in prices for certain sites may have raised concern but “a lot of that was more to do with pent-up demand from developers running out of inventory”. That boils down to years of insufficient land supply.  “This has completely different dynamics and one doesn’t throw in new measures just because of that. Developers were getting satisfied and that’s why you started seeing a drop in (the) bidding for sites.”  Given that these were taking place before last Thursday’s sudden announcement of cooling measures, Mr Lai said: “If you ask me, I thought last Thursday wasn’t necessary.”  The Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) said in a Jul 6 statement that there is no rationale for the latest cooling measures as the property market “is in the early stages of a recovery” in line with economic fundamentals.  Analysts expect the buoyant en bloc market to take a hit given how the new curbs, including a non-remissible five per cent ABSD when developers purchase en bloc properties for redevelopment, raise land acquisition costs. This will, in turn, reduce the bullishness of tender bids.  Buying demand will also be hit by the hike in ABSD rates and tightened loan-to-value (LTV) limits, analysts said.  Moving forward, GuocoLand’s Mr Lai said demand for collective sale sites will depend on location and having the “right product”.  On whether this could result in developers being more lenient when it comes to pricing for future residential property launches, Mr Lai said: “We will probably have to be more flexible but are we going to do massive cuts? No.\"  “I think we will have to be selective in terms of units and their prices. Obviously, for the less advantageous units, we will have to be a lot more flexible.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/developers-see-property-market-slowing-absd-cooling-measures-10524440"}, {"datetime": "13 Jul 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["consumer", "health", "CNA Insider", "Conversation With"], "author": "Derrick A Paulo,", "title": "Coca-Cola to help tackle diabetes scourge, but sugar tax won't help: CEO", "content": " SINGAPORE: Despite the diabetes and obesity problem in Singapore, the United States and other parts of the world, The Coca-Cola Company will always make available its classic Coke in its original formula – with the full amount of sugar. That is nine teaspoons of sugar in a 330-millilitre can, and Coca-Cola president and chief executive officer James Quincey told Channel NewsAsia’s Conversation With that “there’s nothing wrong with it if it’s part of a balanced diet”. Singapore’s guideline on the daily intake of added sugar is that it should not exceed 10 teaspoons. For a 330ml canned drink, this is equivalent to the 12-per-cent sugar cap that the seven biggest soft drink firms here, including Coca-Cola, agreed to meet by 2020 in a pact with the Government. “While there is an obesity crisis, clearly there's a large part of the population that doesn’t have that,” said Mr Quincey. “But clearly, some people need to take more action than others. So that’s why’re investing strongly (in Coke No Sugar),” he noted, adding that the product was growing by “double digits everywhere around the world, including Singapore”. READ: 7 major soft drinks manufacturers in Singapore to reduce sugar content in drinks He admits that beverage companies like his may have been too slow to give consumers a wider range of healthier options. Coca-Cola is making up for lost time by focusing on “reformulating some of our products, on innovation, on making packages smaller and on diversifying the portfolio into new drinks”. “We’re not perfect, but we’re very clear now on what we need to do,” he added. That includes launching tea products with no sugar. SUGAR TAX ‘NOT GOING TO HELP’ Governments are implementing sugar taxes, however, because they think manufacturers are not doing enough. This might be on the cards in Singapore too. And the likely result of such a tax is that sales would go down, admitted Mr Quincey, who questioned whether the objective of “trying to help people rebalance the way they consume” would be achieved. “I think the data coming out is (showing that) very narrow taxes on few categories in the context of food and beverages, where there are lots of other options for people to go for, aren’t proving to be effective,” he said. “There’s a recent study done on the Californian tax, and what it showed is, of course, the sugared sparkling beverages went down. But people bought other food and beverages, so their total calories went up. So it’s not going to help solve it.” The solution, he added, would involve “many stakeholders”, including manufacturers playing their part. “We embrace that idea. We want to be a part of helping to solve that problem, and yet allow people to enjoy great-tasting beverages.” COKE’S SECRET INGREDIENT It has been said that the formula for Coca-Cola, which was invented in 1886 in the American state of Georgia, is probably the most closely kept secret in the food and drink industry. And the way Mr Quincey described how he was let in on it suggested as much. “There’s a secret ingredient. There’s a secret recipe, and it’s held in a very large safe,” he said with a smile, when asked. Despite having worked in the company for more than two decades, even as its chief operating officer, he declared that it was only after he became its CEO last year that he was told the secret, in cloak-and-dagger fashion. “We make a special trip to the secret location where we have this huge fortress room – multiple feet thick of concrete cube,” he said. In there is a filing cabinet with the files. And it’s all written down in old typewriting and scribblings on it … And you have to sign the register, (stating) I came in on this day and I read this bit. Signatures “going back decades” are still there on the page, and the record shows that only “a few tens of people” have known the secret in the company’s long history. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While he called this “part of the magic” of the company, some may wonder if Coca-Cola is perfectly all right to drink, with YouTube videos even showing how the soda can be used to scour toilets. When this was put to him, he said: “Any product, whether it’s Coke or any of the other beverages, is either slightly acidic or slightly alkaline. “If you want the simple experiment, get a lemon, squeeze some lemon juice and then try it with an orange, or try it with some pineapple juice. You’ll find that all of those liquids, ultimately, will wipe stuff off. So beverages are totally safe to consume.” Watch the full interview on Conversation With here.

GIC - ranked as the world's No. 8 sovereign investor with US$390 billion worth of assets according to Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute - flagged its preference for \"reasonably priced\" emerging market stocks while highlighting broader global risks of monetary policy tightening and trade frictions. \"This time around we in fact have reduced some equities and we have raised some cash to make sure that we can get through this environment well and have the ability to take advantage of any dislocations, which we expect to happen down the road,\" CEO Lim Chow Kiat told Reuters in an interview on Thursday (Jul 12). The cautious undertone echoes comments from smaller Singapore peer Temasek Holdings which is looking to temper its pace of investments this year as trade tensions ratchet up between the United States and China. The US government escalated the trade spat this week by issuing a new threat to impose 10 per cent tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods, after slapping tariffs on goods worth US$34 billion last week. Beijing has so far responded with matching tariffs on US exports. \"We maintain the environment is challenging. We'd prefer otherwise, but it remains challenging,\" said Lim, who took over as CEO in January 2017 after a 24-year career at GIC. GIC said in its annual report that over a five-year period ending March 2018, its portfolio returned 6.6 per cent per annum in US dollar nominal terms, versus 5.1 per cent a year ago. That was just below the 6.9 per cent return of its reference portfolio of 65 per cent global equities and 35 per cent bonds. However, the volatility of GIC's portfolio was lower than the reference portfolio. GIC reported a rolling annualised 20-year real return - its key measurement gauge - of 3.4 per cent above global inflation for the year ended March, versus 3.7 per cent a year ago. FAVOURS EMERGING MARKETS The share of developed market equities in GIC's portfolio fell to 23 per cent last year versus 27 per cent a year ago, while allocation to bonds and cash edged up to 37 per cent from 35 per cent. Private equity made up 11 per cent, up from nine per cent. Unlike Temasek that focuses on equities, GIC, set up to manage foreign reserves, has a more conservative investment strategy with the long-term goal of beating global inflation. Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, GIC's Chief Investment Officer, said emerging markets offered better value than developed markets. \"Over the year, what we've seen is that for a long term, emerging markets are still quite lowly priced or reasonably priced, and earnings potential is also quite good. So from a long-term perspective, it's reasonably attractive,\" he said. With about 1,500 employees, GIC says it manages over US$100 billion in assets in over 40 countries, but does not disclose the exact size of its portfolio. It has 32 per cent of its assets in the United States, 19 per cent in Asia excluding Japan and 13 per cent each in Japan and the Euro Zone. GIC and Temasek figured among lead investors in a US$14 billion investment in China's Ant Financial Services Group earlier in 2018 - the biggest-ever single fundraising globally by a private company.

Some divers were happy but we weren't sure of the conditions of the boys. It just felt good to remove our masks and breathe the fresh air,\" said Mr Yeo.  He was among the thousands of people from around the world who came to Chiang Rai and helped rescue the 12 boys and their coach from the cave complex where they had been trapped in for more than two weeks.  Mr Yeo was tasked to help with the last phase of the operation - to evacuate the last four boys and their coach from the depths of the cave.  In a phone interview with Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (Jul 12) from Chiang Rai, Mr Yeo said he decided to volunteer for the rescue operation after reading the news about the perilous situation the Wild Boars football team were in.  \"I had a calling. I talked about it with my wife and my mother, and they gave their blessing,\" said the father of three boys who rushed to northern Thailand via Bangkok on Monday evening after contacting an official involved in the operation.  Mr Yeo said that the most difficult part of the rescue attempt was the need to be patient. He and his fellow rescue divers, most of whom were Thai Navy SEALs, had to wait for nine hours in cold and wet conditions before they were given the go-ahead to escort the boys out.  While waiting, he said he could hear loud murmurs from everyone - divers as well as the boys - praying that they will be safe.  \"I heard different chants and prayers from different religions. But we were all (united) in wanting the operation to be a success,\" said Mr Yeo.  \"We had to do everything slowly, meticulously. We moved (the boys) from chamber to chamber, step by step. We wanted no casualties,\" he said.   \"The muddy water we were diving in was freezing and we had zero visibility but we kept going. We had to feel our way forward by moving along a rescue line (rope) to get out,\" said Mr Yeo, who runs dive school Sunfish Dives in Bintan.  Although he had 26 years of experience in rescue diving, Mr Yeo said nothing had prepared him for the technical challenges of the operation.  \"There were no machines to help us. We had to do it with the equipment we had,\" he explained.  'BROTHERHOOD' WITH FELLOW RESCUERS  Mr Yeo said that the biggest takeaway from the operation was the friendships he formed with fellow divers, who were mostly Thai SEALs, as well as volunteers from around the world.  \"I don’t have a (biological) brother, but now I have so many brothers from Thailand, Argentina and the UK. Everybody accepted me like one of their own, the spirit is great,\" he said.  Now that the operation was over, he would be joining his new \"brothers\" to attend the wake of Saman Kunan, the former Thai Navy SEAL who died during the operation.  \"We're flying there today.

In 2017, South Korea was Singapore’s ninth largest trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods amounting to S$45.4 billion, according to information from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). Three of the six MOUs were exchanged by MTI and South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. In the first MOU, Singapore and South Korea will launch a Korea-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (KSFTA) implementation review within six months. Both countries will also reaffirm commitment to work towards a substantive conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations by this year, MTI said in a news release. The second MOU aims to enhance cooperation in medical and biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, and Industrial Internet of Things, while the third will allow both countries to pursue mutual cooperation in smart grids, as well as energy security and Internet of Things applications in energy technologies. Enterprise Singapore also exchanged two MOUs – the first with South Korea’s Ministry of SMEs & Startups (MSS), and the second with the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). The MOUs, said Enterprise Singapore in a news release, establish new partnerships that drive collaboration and co-innovation between Korean and Singapore enterprises, especially among small and medium enterprises and start-ups. The last MOU, on environmental cooperation, promotes bilateral collaboration in areas such as air and noise pollution, water resource management, climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as waste and hazardous waste management, according to a release from the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources.  Mr Moon was hosted to lunch by Mr Lee after the exchange of MOUs.

Paramedics tried to save Ms Sri Idayu Ghazali, 29, as she lay on a bed covered with blood, but she died in hospital the next day, on Aug 14, 2016. On Thursday (Jul 12) , the High Court sentenced Jonit to 10 years' jail for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Court documents stated that the couple, who got married in 2007, had a rocky relationship. They have two daughters together aged 10 and 11.  Jonit did not have a stable job and was unemployed at the time of the incident. He had an affair with another woman and had a son with her.  Ms Idayu applied for a divorce in March 2016. In July, the month before the stabbing incident, she applied for a personal protection order against her husband. He later moved out of the flat. On the day of the incident, Jonit visited the flat and took his daughters to a playground nearby. That was when he learned that his wife had stayed out late the day before. He later admitted that he was angry with his wife as he suspected that she was going out with another man. At about 8.15pm that day, he took his children home. His wife was sleeping in the master bedroom, while her sister, father and maid were in the living room. HE PLACED A KNIFE IN HIS BACK POCKET Jonit took a knife from the kitchen and put it in the back pocket of his jeans. After Ms Idayu's sister left the flat with Jonit's older daughter, Jonit entered the master bedroom and saw his wife using her handphone on the bed. He asked her if she had gone out the previous night. According to him, she answered that it was none of his \"****ing problem\". Hearing this, Jonit took the knife from his pocket and began stabbing her. His younger daughter rushed into the bedroom when her mother shouted \"sakit\", or \"pain\" in Malay. Jonit stopped stabbing his wife when he saw his daughter. He ran out of the room, threw the knife out of the kitchen window and left the flat. The girl ran to tell her aunt and sister what happened. They rushed back to the flat and saw Ms Idayu bleeding badly. Ms Idayu's sister called the police. AT LEAST 30 STAB WOUNDS ON WIFE'S BODY An autopsy report certified Ms Idayu's cause of death as extensive haemorrhage from stab injuries to her neck, shoulder, chest and abdomen. There were at least 30 stab wounds found on her body. Eight of these were sufficient to cause death. Jonit was later arrested and the knife recovered. In the High Court on Thursday, Jonit's assigned lawyer Ms Sadhana Rai asked for five to seven years' jail, saying that the act was spontaneous. She also said that Jonit suffered from major depressive disorder and had expressed suicidal thoughts in written notes.  However, the prosecution argued that he was able to think rationally before, during and after the act as he hid a knife in his pocket and later threw it away. Justice Chua Lee Ming agreed with the prosecution and sentenced Jonit to 10 years' jail for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He could have been jailed for life and caned.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-stabbed-his-wife-to-death-sentenced-to-10-years-jail-10523470"}, {"datetime": "12 Jul 2018 05:16PM", "tags": ["molest", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Doctor who molested four women at Marina Bay Sands infinity pool gets two weeks' jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: Jagdeep Singh Arora was in Singapore for a holiday with his wife and daughter last month when he molested four women at the infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands, where he was staying. Within the span of half an hour, Jagdeep touched the buttocks of four women between 9pm and 9.30pm on Jun 28. The 46-year-old was charged with molesting two of them, while the two other charges were taken into consideration. One of the victims was a 25-year-old female tourist from Lithuania. She was in the pool on the 57th floor of the hotel at about 9pm that day, taking photographs of the scenery. She noticed Jagdeep, who was with his wife, moving very closely behind her before touching her buttock in the water. She went to look for her husband and informed security about the incident. At about 9.30pm, a second victim, a 20-year-old Korean woman, was with a friend in the pool, also taking photos of the view. While she was in the water, Jagdeep, who was with his wife, moved close to her and touched her stomach. She was shocked and did not know how to react. Jagdeep retracted his hand and walked away, but returned a while later and touched her buttock, as well as her friend's buttock. He also touched the buttock of a fourth woman. On Thursday, the defence said that Jagdeep is a doctor in India and has an 11-year-old daughter with his wife. The family had visited Singapore to celebrate Jagdeep's birthday. Before committing the offences, Jagdeep had had a few drinks, the defence said. \"The accused admits that he has made a terrible mistake,\" he said. \"He has a clean record in India and this is his first brush with the law.\" He added that the incident has caused distress to the family, with Jagdeep's wife returning to Mumbai after the incident and flying in to attend the court hearing. Also, his daughter was present when the offences were committed. The prosecution asked for a short custodial term, leaving the term up to the judge.

North Korea accused the United States on Saturday of making \"gangster-like\" demands in the talks in North Korea late last week, contradicting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who said the old enemies had made progress. Moon, speaking in Singapore during a state visit, said that talks on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula between North Korea and the United States may face hurdles and take time, his office said. \"No one can be optimistic about the results, but my cautious outlook is that the negotiations would be able to succeed if the North carries out a complete denuclearisation, and the international community gathers efforts to provide security guarantees to the North,\" Moon said. The North's criticism was a \"strategy\" meant to show its frustration about what it sees as a lack of action from the United States in response to the steps it had recently taken, Moon said. The North has invited foreign journalists, but not experts as promised, to the dismantling of a nuclear site, and pledged to close a missile engine testing facility. The United States and South Korea have halted annual joint military exercises that North Korea has for years objected to. Pompeo also said the two sides had agreed to hold discussions on Thursday at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjeom on the repatriation of remains of Americans killed in the 1950-53 Korean War. But no one showed up from the North, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said, citing a government official. The return of US remains was one of the key agreements to come from US President Donald Trump's June summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. A US State Department spokesman declined to comment on Thursday except to note that Pompeo had said after his talks in Pyongyang that the date for the meeting to discuss the repatriation of remains was flexible. Pompeo said just before leaving Pyongyang last Saturday that the meeting was set for Jul 12, but \"could move by one day or two\". South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea had called for general-level military negotiations to discuss the return of US remains. Citing an unidentified South Korean official, Yonhap reported that the North Koreans wanted to speak with an American general, possibly as early as Sunday. Neither US nor South Korean officials would immediately confirm the report. Moon said North Korea wanted the United States to take action to end hostile relations and build trust.

In July last year, Khor Siew Tiang, 35, the sole proprietor of Vista Employment Services, applied to bring in a 13-year-old maid. The minor's age was declared as 23, the minimum age requirement of foreign domestic workers set by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in 2005.  An employment inspector with MOM carried out investigations in August last year after receiving information of the case. Khor, who is married with three children, on Thursday pleaded guilty to failing to ensure that the maid met the minimum age requirement. The defence asked for a fine of between S$2,000 and S$4,000, saying that Khor had just given birth to her youngest child at the time of the offence. He added that the maid's passport had a false date of birth, and that the girl was taller than other Burmese women Khor had encountered.  The defence further argued that Khor did not understand the girl's language and that this was her first brush with the law. Furthermore, her employment agency licence has been suspended. District Judge Adam Nakhoda said: \"It's no excuse for her to say she didn't understand the language and had to rely on her counterpart in Myanmar, as it's her responsibility as an employment agent.\" Khor knew that as an employment agency licensee she had to carry out several checks to ensure that the maid she was bringing in met the minimum age requirements. However, she did not conduct a screening of the girl, nor did she carry out any form of basic interviews with her to ask about her family history, the ages of her parents and siblings, her educational history and work experience. Instead, she chose to rely on the information in the girl's biodata provided by her Myanmar agent and the girl's passport, which had an inaccurate date of birth. The judge said that Khor's actions \"resulted in a 13-year-old girl being brought to Singapore\". \"This is 10 years below MOM's minimum age,\" he said. \"Really, this girl is just a child. I'll accept that this was not intentional. This was failure to carry out necessary checks.\" He sentenced Khor to a fine of S$5,000, which the prosecution had asked for.

Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference, Mr Lee said that Singapore is happy to have hosted the recent summit between North Korea and the United States, and wished South Korea and all other parties involved success. “It is a long road ahead, with many more challenges to overcome,” he said. “But I hope the Singapore meeting has set things moving in the right direction.” Mr Lee noted that he appreciates the South Korean government’s initiatives, including Mr Moon’s personal efforts in encouraging dialogue with the North. He added that Singapore will continue to work with South Korea and the international community to achieve lasting peace and stability and the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Speaking through a translator, Mr Moon noted that through hosting the historic North Korea-US Summit, Mr Lee and the people of Singapore have “contributed immensely” towards fostering a new era of peace in the Korean Peninsula. “On behalf of all Korean people, I would like to once again express my profound gratitude to Singapore,” he said.  SPECIFIC WAYS TO UPGRADE BILATERAL RELATIONS During the press conference, Mr Moon outlined specific ways in which Singapore and South Korea can upgrade its bilateral relations to a higher level. These, he said, were discussed and agreed upon during his meeting with Mr Lee. For example, Singapore and South Korea have agreed to strengthen its collaboration for peace and stability in the region. “The scope of our cooperation will be expanded to cover non-traditional security fields including maritime security, cyber-security and the environment,” he said. People-to-people exchanges between both governments will also be expanded, he added. This will be done by increasing high-level exchanges, including at the leaders’ level. Both countries will also expand exchanges with the objective of nurturing talent and people. “In this context, we will expand exchanges between the young people of our two countries who will be the future leaders as well as the rising stars in the field of cutting edge science and technology,” he said.  “I hope that the agreements reached in today’s meeting will be swiftly implemented through follow-up consultations,” he said.  SINGAPORE HAS STRONG, EXPANDING ECONOMIC TIES WITH SOUTH KOREA: PM LEE  Both countries also agreed to further strengthen bilateral economic cooperation, with Mr Lee describing Singapore’s economic ties with South Korea as “strong and expanding”, with overall trade reaching S$45 billion in 2017. He expressed the hope that progress could be made on existing areas of cooperation like trade. For example, he hoped that the next implementation review of the Korea-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (KSFTA) can be held soon. “It will show the international community that our countries are committed to free and open trade,” he said.  During the visit, Mr Lee and Mr Moon also witnessed the signing of six Memoranda of Understanding covering the environment, free trade, smart grids, the fourth industrial revolution, small and medium enterprises, and investments. “These agreements build upon our existing cooperation and trade mechanisms, but also our complementary strengths,” he said. “We also welcome Korean companies to take advantage of Singapore to expand into the ASEAN region.” Mr Moon described Singapore as the second largest trade partner and the biggest investment partner of Korea, among ASEAN countries, adding that both countries have agreed to “invigorate mutual investment” by significantly increasing bilateral trade volume, and by swiftly concluding the revision of the double tax avoidance agreement. He added that Korean companies have been participating in “landmark construction projects in Singapore”. “I look forward to seeing Korean companies further contribute to the construction projects in transportation and infrastructure that the Singapore government is pursuing,” he said.   SOUTH KOREA ALSO INCREASING ENGAGEMENT WITH ASEAN REGION  Both leaders also discussed South Korea’s relations with regional bloc ASEAN. Mr Moon commended Singapore, as ASEAN chair, for putting “a lot of effort” into establishing a “more dynamic ASEAN community” under the theme of innovation and resilience. Mr Lee added that both leaders discussed South Korea’s relations with ASEAN, and said he was glad that South Korea is increasing its engagement with the region. Possibilities for growing relations between ASEAN and South Korea could include upgrading the ASEAN-ROK (Republic of Korea) Free Trade Area and concluding an ASEAN-Korea Air Services agreement, he said. Mr Moon’s visit to Singapore is his first as president, and the first state visit by a South Korean president to Singapore in 15 years.

According to The Straits Times, Mr Kausikan’s speech outlined three ways in which China stands out from other major countries that “persuade, induce and coerce\". The first involves rejecting the norm of non-interference in another state’s domestic affairs and believing that its interests should be promoted wherever they may be, The Straits Times’ report stated. The second is where China uses a range of tactics from legitimate diplomacy to more covert and often illegal deployment of agents of influence and operations - to sway decision makers or public opinion leaders. The third, Mr Kausikan said, refers to the aim of its influence operations, which he added was not just to direct behaviour but to condition it as well.He also said a key tactic is to present target countries with oversimplified narratives, \"forcing false choices on you and making you choose between them\", The Straits Times reported. \"China doesn't just want you to comply with its wishes, it wants you to ... do what it wants without being told,” he was quoted as saying.“When the Chinese try to impose a Chinese identity on Singapore, we must resist, because modern Singapore is based on the idea of being a multiracial country,\" he added. In a response published by The Straits Times on Thursday (Jul 12), the Chinese ambassador described Mr Kausikan’s speech as a “far cry from reality and leaves an unfavourable impression of China on others”. Ambassador Hong said: “In response, I would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies. In this sense, China is no different. Unlike some countries, however, China does not impose its ideology and development model.\" He said China often found itself as the target of “groundless attacks”, as global media is largely dominated by the West. “In recent years, China has made great efforts in carrying out its international responsibilities and put forward some initiatives on regional and global cooperation, including the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. These have gained a positive response from many countries, not because of manipulation but because they meet the interests of other parties and provide opportunities for common development,” the Chinese ambassador added. Mr Hong said while China is an “engine” of global economic growth, it has always been willing to share its development opportunities with others and by no means imposes its models on other countries. “China's foreign policies are aimed at serving its national development. Beyond that, China also endeavours to incorporate its development into the greater cause of world peace and prosperity, working towards the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind. With these objectives in mind, China has implemented its foreign policies consistently. We uphold the principles of peaceful co-existence and champion global fairness and justice. We oppose the big bullying the small and interference in others' internal affairs. This is what China has said and this is also what China has been doing,” Mr Hong added. SINGAPORE-CHINA RELATIONSThe Straits Times said that at the forum, Mr Kausikan had also said narratives used against Singapore by China included: \"Singapore has no claim in the South China Sea, so why is the Singapore Government taking sides against China?\" and \"Relations were much better under Mr Lee Kuan Yew because he understood China in a way the present Singapore leadership does not”. Addressing this, China’s ambassador said his country attaches “great importance” to Singapore-China relations and “cherishes the friendship established by several generations of our leaders”. “Mr Lee Kuan Yew, with his extraordinary strategic vision, made important contributions to the establishment and development of our diplomatic ties. We are pleased to see that Mr Lee's strategic vision and commitment to the relationship have been inherited by his successors. “Over the years, our ties have progressed and continue to do so based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. China respects Singapore's achievements in maintaining racial and religious harmony. It has no intention of influencing Singaporeans' sense of their national identity and will never do so. Our close bonds in history and culture should be positive factors and not a burden in the development of our relationship,” Mr Hong said. The ambassador added: \"Mr Kausikan condemned China for presenting false choices and forcing other countries to choose between them. But, in fact, it is his speech that is misleading others into misunderstanding China.\" “Distorting the image of China, a key player in the international community, not only causes harm to China but also impairs the friendship and cooperation among countries.

The birds' arrival will make the Jurong Bird Park the only zoological institution in Southeast Asia where visitors will be able to view the species, Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) - which runs the park - said in a press release on Thursday (Jul 12). Flown over from Qatar in June, the 11-year-old male and 17-year-old female will join other critically endangered wetland birds in the park. Native to tropical East Africa, the Shoebills, also known as Balaeniceps rex, are classified as Vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. They face threats such as habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade. There are only 30 Shoebills under human care in the world, and an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 birds remaining in the wild, according to WRS. The birds - which can live for up to 35 years in the wild - are named for their large shoe-shaped bills, which are more than 20cm long and have a sharp hook at the end for killing prey. Though their diet consists primarily of fish, Shoebills also consume amphibians, snakes, rodents and even baby crocodiles. Jurong Bird Park first displayed Shoebills in 1995, and its last specimen died in 2015. WRS said the park hopes to breed the pair although it is rare under human care. \"With only two recorded cases of successful breeding under human care reported, Jurong Bird Park hopes to breed the pair and help to better understand the biology of this amazing species,\" it said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/rare-shoebill-birds-jurong-bird-park-10522338"}, {"datetime": "12 Jul 2018 10:37AM", "tags": ["cigarettes", "tobacco", "smoking"], "author": "", "title": "7-Eleven store among 6 retailers caught selling tobacco products to minors", "content": " SINGAPORE: Several retailers, including a 7-Eleven outlet, have had action taken against them for selling cigarettes to minors under the age of 18 - including to one as young as 13, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said on Thursday (Jul 12).  One retailer, Mohamed Buhari Trading, had its tobacco retail licence revoked after it was caught selling cigarettes to a 17-year-old minor wearing their school uniform.  The retailer, located at 103 Teck Whye Lane, will no longer be able to sell tobacco products.  TOBACCO RETAIL LICENCES SUSPENDED Five other retailers, including a 7-Eleven outlet in Simei, had their tobacco retail licences suspended for six months after selling cigarettes to under-18 minors for the first time.  According to HSA, one of the sellers had sold cigarettes to a 13-year-old and claimed she had not checked for any identification because she was unwell.

Mr Chan was speaking at the sidelines of his meetings with key EU officials and representatives during his visit to Brussels on Wednesday (11 July). These officials include Austrian Federal Minister for Digital and Economic Affairs Dr Margarete Schramböck, EU Trade Commissioner Ms Cecilia Malmström and EUSFTA Rapporteur Mr David Martin, among others. During the meetings, Mr Chan reaffirmed Singapore’s interest in the expeditious ratification of the EUSFTA and held discussions about the latest developments on trade policy. The aim is for the agreement to come into force by next year before the European Commission’s mandate ends. Mr Chan said the conclusion of the agreement is crucial, especially against the backdrop of the trade conflict between the US and China, which Mr Chan described as a spat that could “significantly impact” Singapore’s open economy. \"In the current climate of protectionism and unilateralism, it is in our common interest to send a strong and powerful statement to the rest of the world that we have like-minded partners that continue to believe in the free, open and rule-based multilateral system,” he said.

This would be the third round of tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by the Trump administration and comes shortly after US tariffs on US$34 billion worth of Chinese goods kicked in last Friday. Mr Chan also said the EU-Singapore pact will act as a pathfinder for other Asian countries. \"Many of the ASEAN and Asian countries will be looking at Singapore and the EU and say that if Singapore and EU can do it, then there's always hope for the rest of the countries to have similar agreements with the EU to benefit their economies and people,” he said.

The “Soft Power 30” index, first launched in 2015, measures a country’s soft power via objective data on six categories, such as government and culture, and international polling on seven other indicators. It was produced by communications consultancy Portland in partnership with the University of Southern California Center on Public Diplomacy.  Among the categories, Singapore was the best performer for enterprise for the third consecutive year – an “impressive feat” due to its economic competitiveness, rule of law and favourable business and innovation-fostering environment, according to the report.  Singapore also rose to seventh position in the digital category, which assesses various metrics such as a country’s digital connectivity. For this, the report described Singapore as “one of the most wired societies; powered by its excellent digital infrastructure, efficient government online services and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s savvy use of social media”.  The country, however, was ranked lower in the other categories of government (23rd), education (23rd), engagement (30th) and culture (28th). Its small size is one limiting factor, according to the report.  “Extensive efforts to showcase the young nation’s diverse cultural offering have yet to be reflected in the polling, and its diplomatic footprint remains small. This makes the use of digital diplomacy all the more important.”  As it takes over the rotating chairmanship of ASEAN this year, Singapore has “leveraged its digital expertise to great effect, launching the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, and highlighting its role in bringing prosperity and stability to the region”.  The report added that Singapore made its mark on the global stage by hosting the historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un last month.  “Building on the momentum of the Singapore Summit and the ASEAN chairmanship, Singapore should leverage its reputation as a trusted and effective government to establish its role as a neutral and fair arbiter,” it said.  Describing Singapore as an \"inspiring example\" of how small countries can “carry global influence through attraction and persuasion”, Mr Jonathan McClory, Portland’s general manager for Asia and author of the report, said: “Amidst a shifting geopolitical landscape, Singapore has real opportunities ahead to elevate its profile in international diplomacy and global affairs.”  ASIA’S SOFT POWER ON THE RISE The report named United Kingdom (UK) as the country with the most soft power this year. It was followed by France, Germany, United States (US) and Japan. Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Netherlands and Australia rounded out the top 10. The UK’s first-place finish was a “surprise” given how the negotiations for Brexit has had “little tangible progress”, the report wrote. As such, there are “huge question marks” over the UK’s future relationship with the European Union (EU), its long-term global influence and its role in the world.  “Moreover, should the exit be a chaotic one, it is hard to see global public opinion on the UK remaining buoyant,” it added.  Meanwhile, the US slipped one spot to be ranked fourth, due to “detrimental effects” of the Trump administration’s protectionist and nationalist approach to foreign policy, the report said.  “Last year, a very sharp decline in global perceptions of the US was reported in the polling data whereas this year objective metrics have also registered the erosion of American soft power,” the media release wrote, citing an “obvious fall” in the government category from twelfth to the sixteenth position.  “’America First’ is clearly not winning hearts and minds abroad,” it added.  In an index dominated by Europe and the Americas, four Asian countries made it to the list. Apart from Singapore, they are Japan, South Korea (20th) and China (27th).  The fifth position is Japan’s highest ranking over the years. It is also the first time an Asian country has made it into the index’s top five.  For South Korea, a politically-charged Olympic Games and an easing in tensions on the Korean peninsula helped it to move up one spot this year.  The report said that all four Asian countries have seen improved aggregate rankings since the index started in 2015. “Asian countries are translating economic development into soft power gains over the medium term,” it wrote.  “Soft power is the critical foreign policy tool in this age of interdependence and global challenges,” said Mr McClory. “The change in the top five countries – the first time an Asian country has broken into the top five – is indicative of the unfolding shift in the global balance of power.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-slips-a-notch-to-21st-in-global-ranking-of-soft-power-10520478"}, {"datetime": "12 Jul 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["Trending", "CNA Lifestyle Experiences"], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "CNA Lifestyle Experiences: At 98, Singapore's oldest living artist continues to be obsessed with art", "content": " CNA LIFESTYLE EXPERIENCES: Meet one of Singapore’s most respected artists at the opening of his latest special exhibition. Details below. Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more exclusive events. SINGAPORE: At the ripe old age of 98, Singapore’s oldest living artist just can’t stop thinking about art. As we settled down for a chat at his home in Telok Kurau, Lim Tze Peng confessed that he hadn't gotten a good night’s sleep. “I woke up at 4am thinking about how to paint better,” he shared in Mandarin, with a gentle chuckle. “When I think too much about painting or writing calligraphy, I can’t sleep well. Even when I’m sitting here, I’m thinking of it. When I lie down on my bed, I’m thinking of it!” Talk about dedication. After decades of creating some of the most familiar and iconic Chinese ink paintings of the Singapore River and Chinatown (and breaking auction records and snagging a Cultural Medallion award along the way), we half-expected to find Mr Lim just chilling out at home with his grandchildren, resting on his laurels during his twilight years. SINGAPORE’S VERY IMPORTANT CHINESE INK ARTIST But amazingly, he’s still at it. One of the coolest senior artists we’ve ever met, Mr Lim may have stopped painting full-time, but he still does a bit of calligraphy as a form of exercise at his second-floor artist studio, which is crammed with old paintings and scrolls. And while he mostly just stays at home these days, he’ll soon be stepping out for his first solo exhibition in two years. Later this month, Ode To Art Gallery is presenting Portrait Of The Heart, a retrospective of Mr Lim’s artworks through the years. It will comprise over 80 pieces that span his entire practice, from his Singapore River and street scenes to his Tree series and even experimental calligraphy works. And they’re not all old pieces – he’s even throwing in a few recent ones, too. While Mr Lim admits to feeling “a bit of pressure” with the exhibition, he’s also looking forward to it. “I feel delighted that someone is organising the show, and people want to come and enjoy my work,” he said. For gallery owner Jazz Chong, holding the exhibition was a no-brainer. “He’s a very important Chinese ink artist in Singapore; the oldest and probably the most prominent Singaporean artist alive. Because he has had so many years of practice, you see the evolution of his works.” FROM PASIR RIS KAMPONGS TO THE SINGAPORE RIVER And, in a way, of Singapore, too. Born in 1921 to parents who were pig and chicken farmers in Pasir Ris, the eldest of seven children recalled learning how to paint in his twenties, with the local villages in the area one of his favourite subjects. “Near our place – we lived in an attap house – there were a lot of Malay kampongs and I used to go there to do drawings. I did a few hundred pieces,” he said. But Mr Lim didn’t become a full-time artist until much later – he spent the first half of his life as a primary school teacher, while occasionally joining other artists, such as the seminal Ten Men Group, in trips to other places in the region. Upon his retirement in the late 1970s, Mr Lim switched gears. Around this time, Pasir Ris had also started to lose its kampong vibe thanks to development, and he shifted his attention to the subject matter he would really become famous for – the Singapore River and Chinatown. “I have a lot of good memories of the Singapore River – it was a unique part of Singapore at that point in time,” Mr Lim recalled. “And it wasn’t just me who painted there. There would be hundreds of artists, there would be tourists taking photos, the big bumboats. There was so much activity. It wasn’t so clean as it is now, but it wasn’t very smelly because of the low and high tides,” he quipped. Mr Lim also has vivid memories of the street scenes in Chinatown. “The clothes hanging outside the shophouses were like flags - a lot of colours and very beautiful. On the streets, you’d see hawkers on one end selling fish, duck and fruit. On the other, you’d see the Samsui women, bent over as they were walking or working. It was the perfect subject matter.” ‘I SEE, I PAINT. I THINK, I PAINT.’ While these artworks had made Mr Lim famous, he went on to do others – experimenting with calligraphy in the 1990s and 2000s. “I always felt the need to come up with new expressions, new things,” he explained. “When I was younger, I used to go out – I see, I paint. As I've become older and can't go out anymore, I think, then I paint.” His personal drive to innovate would eventually reap even bigger rewards. In 2003, he received the prestigious Cultural Medallion, the highest accolade for any artist in Singapore. A few years ago, he also received the Meritorious Service Award. Mr Lim’s artworks have also been a hit in the art market. In 2012, one of his Chinese ink paintings of a Singapore River scene sold for S$101,800 at a Christie’s auction in Hong Kong – a record then for a living Singaporean artist. And while you might think Mr Lim’s works aren’t quite popular among younger art lovers weaned on cool contemporary art, you’d be surprised to find out that his works continue to resonate with a new generation. “A lot of those who collect him are actually quite young,” said Ode To Art’s Ms Chong, who says that prices for Mr Lim’s works range between S$10,000 to half a million for his big pieces. “There are those in their early 30s, who’re looking for something for their new homes, who are starting to say they want to be more connected to their roots, and they feel they can relate to his art, whether it’s calligraphy or old Singapore scenes; the aesthetic side or the nostalgic side,” she said. At just two years short of the century mark, and having made so many innovations in his practice and being lauded for it, most people would probably think it’s time for Mr Lim to take a step back and just enjoy the moment. But Singapore’s oldest living artist has other plans. Mr Lim shared that he recently did a seal carving, which said, in Chinese, “treasure your remaining years”. “Although I’m close to 100 years old, I want to make the best use of my time. I want to think more and innovate more,” he said. Hopefully, not at the expense of a good night’s sleep. Lim Tze Peng’s solo exhibit Portrait Of The Heart runs from Jul 26 to Aug 12 at Ode To Art Gallery, Raffles City Shopping Centre.

This idea was well received by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen who remarked that “even joint patrols with our agencies and their agencies, I completely agree with that”. These remarks from both defence establishments came on the heels of controversial comments from Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad about reviewing the price of water Malaysia sells to Singapore. But the idea of joint patrols in the area isn’t a new suggestion. BACK TO 2003 Back in January 2003, then Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar proposed having joint patrols with Singapore off Pedra Branca as the challenges of operating in these narrow straits became clear to both sides. Syed Hamid’s suggestion came in the wake of the collision between a Republic of Singapore Navy patrol vessel and a cargo ship about 1.8 km off the island. “To me, it is good when both parties carry out monitoring ... each other's presence is made known so that there will not be any accident,” the top Malaysian diplomat stressed back then, pointing out that waters off the rocky outcrop accommodate a busy international shipping lane. He had added: I think it's better for us to cooperate with each other and understand each other's presence without the intention of getting engaged in aggression or physical contact. Belying these comments were the testy nature of relations between both countries that year. Both countries were in the midst of negotiating an agreement to refer the dispute over Pedra Branca to the International Court of Justice.  Negotiations on a package of issues including water, the Causeway Bridge and airspace had just crumbled. Exchanges in the media were heated and acrimonious. Yet cooperation between the two navies continued apace. Both sides proceeded that year with the annual exercise Malapura, a flagship annual joint training exercise between the Republic of Singapore Navy and the Royal Malaysian Navy, involving warships, fighter jets and maritime patrol aircraft. LONGSTANDING RECORD OF SUSTAINED NAVAL LINKS History tells us that we shouldn’t gloss over the value of sustained, institutionalised military-to-military linkages even in times of political turbulence. Around the world, such linkages often become casualties with downturns in political relations. Yet it’s precisely in times of tension that militaries ought to maintain those links as a way to promote confidence-building and crisis management. Even as cooperation between air and land forces may be disrupted, maritime forces, especially navies, are key in promoting interstate relations. Navies serve as their countries’ ambassadors and can help to ensure that political tensions between countries do not translate to blows on the ground, in undelimited waters. This set of bilateral naval links have continued to grow over the decades, and the common security challenges both sides share have led Malaysia and Singapore to work closely together within the rubric of the Malacca Straits Patrols, inaugurated in 2006, with Indonesia and Thailand for example. BUILDING ON INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THE TWO NAVIES Cooperation also brings professional value to both navies. Exercise Malapura has evolved over the years, with its scope becoming more complex – moving from shipboard tactical procedures of individual vessels to broader operational matters involving planning at group level. Both navies have also explored developing common operating procedures and naval techniques, jointly tackled topical issues such as rules of engagement, and expanded forces involved to include air force and maritime security elements. The idea of broadening naval cooperation to operations elsewhere was mooted in 2011 when then Malaysian Defence Minister Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi suggested the two navies cooperate to protect shipping security in the Gulf of Aden, since both forces were already contributing to counter-piracy operations there. “We are inviting the Singapore Navy to be involved in our operations as it will be part of an international team and not just representing its own country … This is apt as Malaysia and Singapore will be jointly protecting the merchant ships from Southeast Asian countries against piracy,” he remarked. PERSISTENT SECURITY THREATS It is a worthwhile idea to expand maritime security cooperation, especially between the two navies, beyond the Malacca Strait to include the eastern Strait of Singapore, around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. In recent years, threats to shipping in the eastern waterways can come from a variety of causes including accidents, piracy and potentially maritime terrorism. Given how much of world trade and energy passes through these waters, cooperation in the area between both sides may go some way to ensure these sea lanes remain safe and secured for international shipping. For example, in October 2016, two individuals were apprehended by Malaysian authorities in waters off Middle Rocks after conducting unauthorised diving activities there.  Incidents of men overboard and boats sinking in the vicinity over these two years underscore the utility of both sides cooperating in search-and-rescue operations. The collision between the American destroyer USS John McCain and an oil tanker near Pedra Branca also illustrates the importance of communications and coordination of movement in those waters. A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL SETUP Pushing for closer maritime security cooperation around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks would be clearly mutually beneficial for both Malaysia and Singapore. Joint patrols to respond to abrupt contingencies in the area would allow both countries to free up resources and allocate them to other locations. In particular, Kuala Lumpur could assign more maritime security assets to eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea where piracy incidents have risen in recent years. But one also should not forget the role of civilian maritime agencies in this potential setup which include the Malaysian Marine Operations Force and Singapore Police Coast Guard, agencies who tackle transnational crime including smuggling. If both countries decide to ride on the present momentum, Malaysia and Singapore authorities could consider how best to bring together their maritime forces, both military and civilian. A first step may be to commence a joint feasibility study on a slate of maritime security operations in waters around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. It may be prudent to start small, focusing on search-and-rescue and joint action against transnational crime and counter-terrorism in those waterways. A more ambitious idea is for exercise Malapura, which has traditionally been conducted in the Malacca Strait, to extend to waters near Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and expand into a multi-agency activity involving the two countries’ civilian and maritime law enforcement bodies. When Singapore as chair of ASEAN this year is advancing confidence-building measures like the Code of Unplanned Encounters at Sea and both countries are already signatories, such an expansion may be practical because it sensitises other agencies to real-word maritime security operations.

In a press release, ECDA highlighted that research studies have proven such \"high quality adult-child interactions\" enable children from low-income backgrounds to improve their cognitive and socio-emotional development, and catch up with their peers.  Developed by American Professor Joseph Sparling and Professor Craig Ramey, the Abecedarian Approach is being used in countries like the United States, Denmark and China. \"We wanted to equalise the playing field and that is the reason we focused on them (children from low-income families) originally. We designed a programme that works especially well for them, but fortunately it also works for all children,” Professor Sparling said. Mr Richard Magnus, chairman of Temasek Foundation Cares, said that through intentional and meaningful interactions with adults, children who naturally have a curiosity to explore, discover and learn will expand their cognitive, language and emotional abilities. “Their parents will learn to reinforce the lessons and learning. This is a critical developmental pilot which we hope will be scaled up,\" he said.  Ms Raudhah Alias, 38, an infant care teacher at PCF Sparkletots@Kebun Baru, has already seen improvements since her centre implemented the Abecedarian Approach.  \"The children are now more engaged. I can see they're interacting more with the teachers,” she said. Speaking at the launch, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said this pilot programme provides additional support for the Government’s continued efforts to invest in quality, accessible and affordable pre-school education. He added that we can “continue to build upon opportunities and avenue” to give the best possible start for every child in Singapore. ECDA will work with four pre-school operators - NTUC My First Skool, PCF Sparkletots, Persatuan Pemudi Islam Singapore (PPIS) and Presbyterian Community Services - to train 60 teachers and identify 100 children across 16 pre-schools to participate in the programme. Temasek Foundation Cares has committed S$1.6 million to fund the programme over the next three years.

A caller to the show felt that parents of children with special needs are in denial and want to believe that their children are normal, so they insist that their children be in mainstream schools when they actually should be taught elsewhere. Ms Rahayu had earlier revealed that her son Ayden, who was born in April 2017 has Down's Syndrome. “I CRIED MY EYES OUT THAT AFTERNOON” Hearing the caller's comment, she said it felt that children like her son “will always be seen as a burden, that they should be put in appropriate places\". “Honestly, I understood where the gentleman was coming from,” Ms Rahayu said. “The challenges faced by teachers in such settings are real and we need to deal with these challenges.” “But the caller’s solution to the problem offended and hurt me as a parent. His tone and the curt manner in which he declared his views reflected how he felt about children who are different. “To me it felt like a rejection,” she said.   “I cried my eyes out that afternoon,” added Ms Rahayu. She was speaking on a motion titled “Education for Our Future”, moved by five Nominated MPs. The motion calls on the Government to partner with the people to ensure accessible, inclusive and lifelong education for all learners. \"I believe that we can review and build our education system so as to change perceptions, normalise disabilities, so that people can appreciate that persons with special needs are simply differently abled and are of no lesser value than any other member of society,” Ms Rahayu said. The house agreed to her proposal that the motion include the following words: “By building an education system that gives each student the best possible support and the opportunity and motivation to excel, recognises ability and talent in every student, and offers development paths suited to their unique strengths and interests, enables Singaporeans to improve our lives, paying special attention to students from vulnerable families, and becomes a platform to bring our young together, to build an inclusive and united Singapore.” ENHANCING INCLUSIVENESS IN EDUCATION WILL “BRING GREAT BENEFIT TO SINGAPORE” While society is now also more open and accepting of people with special needs, she added that a “quick sensing of the current environment” suggests that it is still not completely comfortable with them. Citing statistics from an attitude study conducted by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2015, Ms Rahayu noted that the public viewed those with disabilities less favourably than those without a disability. They also, she said, had less favourable attitudes towards those with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder. Ms Rahayu stressed that enhancing inclusiveness in the education system will bring great benefit to Singapore as a whole. For one, she said that fully embracing people with special needs within the community will create opportunities for people to be more caring and compassionate. There is, she said, also great future economic value in equipping children with special needs with the necessary skills so they can be independent. “If we intervene early, in schools, we give them the necessary skills and prepare them for the future, there is a greater chance that they would graduate school and join the workforce,” she explained. “If they can work well, be independent and contribute meaningfully towards the economy, less resources need to be spent on support structures or schemes when they are adults.” To that end, she made several suggestions on how to enhance the education landscape. These include an integrated education system and school setting, where children with and without special needs learn and play within the same setting, but in different pathways as well as improving the profession and career pathway of special education teachers. “I propose that these teachers come under the purview of the Ministry of Education like their peers in mainstream schools so that they would have access to the same salary scales, as well as career opportunities,” she said. She also proposed a review of the administration of school curriculum for both mainstream and special education schools. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I FELT LIKE A BURDEN: CHIA YONG YONG  The topic was also brought up by Nominated MP Chia Yong Yong, who highlighted the importance of acceptance by Singaporeans of those with disabilities and special needs.   In an emotional speech, Ms Chia said that inclusive education requires parents of children without disabilities or special needs to agree to allow their children to attend school and make friends with children with disabilities and special needs.   Recounting her own personal experience as a person with a disability who has benefited from mainstream education, Ms Chia said that she was blessed to have many teachers who have made a difference because they did not treat her as one who is inferior to a child without a disability.   These teachers, she said, accommodated her disability, but treated her the same. “So when I did not do my homework, I was punished, and when I talked too much, I was punished. But I was like any other child,” she said.   “It wasn’t always easy, and there were times when I felt like a burden, and I’m sure there were many times my friends felt like I was a nuisance,” she added.   “But you know what? We stuck together and grew up together.”   “What I went through is an opportunity we should give to every child,” she said.   Her words drew a response from Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah, who affirmed in her speech that inclusivity is an area that will continue to be an important part of MOE’s work.   She stressed that Ms Chia is “definitely not a burden\".   “In fact, she is very much a blessing,” she said. “Her disability, or rather, special ability, has enabled her to give this House insights and perspectives that we would otherwise not have had.”  “This has enriched our debate and informed our policy, and her presence here has given us a much more positive contribution,” she added.   “This is the value and the benefit of inclusivity, and of being able to draw on people of different talents and abilities.” ​​​​​​​", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/promoting-inclusivity-in-education-singapore-still-has-some-way-10520018"}, {"datetime": "11 Jul 2018 08:19PM", "tags": ["PSLE", "Education"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "Levelling the playing field key in drive for better education system: MPs, NMPs", "content": " SINGAPORE: Education should not be based on a “one size fits all” approach, but rather, it should allow for equal opportunities for students across the board, said several Members of Parliament (MPs) as well as Nominated MPs on Wednesday (Jul 11). A total of 13 MPs and NMPs discussed the motion: “Education for Our Future” in Parliament, which calls on the Government to partner with the people to ensure accessible, inclusive and lifelong education for all learners.  Five NMPs - Mahdev Mohan, Kuik Shiao-Yin, Ganesh Rajaram, Kok Heng Leun and Azmoon Ahmad - had proposed the motion. Those who spoke on the motionstressed the need to consider different education systems, rather than sticking to the tried and tested approach which might not benefit every student. NMP Azmoon said: “I regard our current education system as a ‘one size fits all’ approach, with minor tweaks here and there to cater for the incidentals which are away from the mainstream. “We should be bold enough to take the step forward to consider multiple education systems and strategies with different approaches to serve the varying individual needs - a holistic system where every dream and aspirations are met.\" Giving the illustration of a child from a lower-income family who could start off at a disadvantage, Mr Azmoon said that decision makers have to “go beyond lip service about levelling the playing field\". “These are the very real circumstances that our students are going through and something needs to be done to help them,” he said. One suggestion raised was to encourage more top schools in Singapore to focus on more than just their own cohort, in order to move away from the stereotype that such schools are only for “bright students from wealthy backgrounds” noted NMP Mahdev. Giving the example of his alma mater Raffles Institution, Mr Mahdev pointed to how the school has established a scholarship and mentorship programme to provide financial support and role models for primary five and six students. “Might I ask the Ministry to invite other top secondary schools to also account (for) what they are doing to ensure that social mobility is not frustrated and that elite groups of Singaporeans and foreigners in these schools that do emerge do not only look out for their own?” he asked. MORE FOCUS ON SPORTS EDUCATION Describing sports, and football in particular, as a “social leveler platform”, NMP Ganesh suggested offering a common basic curriculum to introduce popular sports to all children. “Sports in our schools should be a meeting place for friendship, fellowship and the pure enjoyment of sport – regardless of your family and financial background. It is one of the few places in a child’s schooling life where he or she is not judged by their academic prowess, and we should do all we can to return to this spirit,” he said. Mr Ganesh also called for a further scrutiny of the Direct School Admission (DSA) system. He pointed to the emergence of \"DSA coaches\" who tailor programmes specifically for children to guarantee a place in the school of their choice as an example of how some take advantage of the system. “We need to ask ourselves if this is what the DSA scheme is intended to be, and if this 'gaming' of the system is acceptable,” he said. “Is this what sports is about? Do we want to encourage such behaviour and, worse, reward it, by giving these children places in our top schools? “To me, values such as integrity and fair play are as important, if not more, than one’s ability as an athlete. By including these other criteria in the DSA selection process, the Ministry would send a strong signal to the teachers, coaches, parents and children about the kind of young Singaporeans it hopes to nurture. And it will also create a more level playing field as these values cannot be paid for.” MP for Nee Soon GRC Henry Kwek suggested that sports was a good way for youths to bridge the social divides. He urged the MOE to strengthen its collaboration with the Ministry for Culture, Community and Youth’s (MCCY) ActiveSG programme to encourage social mixing through sports. “MOE and MCCY can collaborate by growing ActiveSG’s Sports Academy and Clubs to absorb more students from all schools, and give them CCA points under the LEAD framework. At the same time, MOE can also invite Sports Academy to send teams to join various inter-school sports teams,” said Mr Kwek. SLAUGHTERING “THE SACRED COW” OF PSLE?   NMP Kok revived the debate about abolishing the PSLE from the education system, in order to allow more focus on deep learning and interaction among young students. Sharing the story of a mother who noticed that her son was beginning to feel academic pressure in kindergarten and later lost his sense of curiosity when he was in primary three, Mr Kok asked: “Is PSLE really necessary?” Amid a push to overhaul the PSLE system, as well as eradicate competition and stress among students and parents, MOE announced that from 2021, students taking the exams will be graded with Achievement Levels of 1 to 8 in each of their four subjects. But Mr Kok stressed that the topic still warranted consideration, asking that MOE consider slaughtering this “sacred cow”. “If young students have to prepare for a major examination after an initial six years of study, does it impede their ability to learn deeply, discover and investigate?,” he asked. “I think we need to fundamentally agree on what is important in the education of our young people. Is it deep learning and interaction? If so, can we rethink the current system to make time for this aspect, rather than rush them through national education that determines their path of education at so tender an age,” he said.   However, fellow NMP Kuik said she was “of two minds” on whether to abolish the exam. “It is hardly a silver bullet solution and abolishing it will definitely generate many new problems and fail to resolve some old ones,” she said. She pointed out that scrapping PSLE will set off a chain reaction of “uncomfortable changes” such as how primary school teachers will be compelled to design and deliver a curriculum that is no longer about preparing children for a standardised exam.   “MOE would have to devise a whole new way to assess the quality of teaching in primary schools without data from PSLE results,” added Ms Kuik. MP Darryl David, who stressed that he was not advocating scrapping the PSLE, suggested that MOE consider how it can make the exam “about a demonstration of other skill sets and capabilities, other than the ability to “cram-and-deliver”. “Perhaps the element of coursework or continuous assessment could be introduced as part of one’s PSLE grade, such that the eventual PSLE score is a more holistic reflection of a young adult’s capabilities and abilities,” said the Ang Mo Kio GRC MP.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/levelling-the-playing-field-key-in-drive-for-better-education-10520632"}, {"datetime": "11 Jul 2018 08:00PM", "tags": ["Education", "Parliament", "Ong Ye Kung", "PSLE"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Lift the bottom, not cap the top: Minister Ong Ye Kung outlines key principles on education system", "content": " SINGAPORE: Capping achievements and limiting opportunities at the top in a bid to close the achievement gap runs against a fundamental philosophy of Singapore’s education system, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Wednesday (Jul 11). Speaking in response to a parliamentary motion filed by five Nominated MPs on “Education for our Future”, Mr Ong explained that the easiest way to close this gap is to cap the top, and some suggestions raised in public are pointing in that direction. This includes banning tuition and enrichment classes, or redistributing resources from popular to less popular schools. But he stressed that it is better to lift the bottom, and his ministry’s resourcing of schools reflects this approach. In a wide-ranging speech outlining the key principles of the education system, Mr Ong revealed that the highest level of resourcing – about S$24,000 per student – goes to specialised schools like Crest, Spectra, NorthLight School and Assumption Pathway School. Students in the Normal (Technical) and Normal (Academic) streams get about S$20,000 and S$15,000 each in resources respectively. In contrast, a student in other courses in a Government, Government-Aided or Independent school would receive under S$15,000 in resources. Furthermore, he said, MOE regularly rotates its staff to ensure that good performing teachers and principals are well spread across different types of schools. The Public Service Commission (PSC) also reaches out to students from different schools, and has been paying special attention to applicants from lower income families. As a result, he said, the percentage of PSC scholars from two junior colleges – Raffles Institution and Hwa Chong Institution – has come down to 60 per cent last year, compared to more than 80 per cent in 2007. Interview techniques are also being adjusted, he added. “Recognising that students from poorer backgrounds tend to be less articulate, the Commission is assessing candidates beyond their communication skills, but on the substance of their ideas and thinking.” ‘SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES’ IN LIFTING THE BOTTOM  The Government’s approach in lifting the bottom, said Mr Ong, has resulted in some other significant outcomes. For one, he said, opportunities that were once regarded as only available to students from more affluent backgrounds have become more broadly accessible. Most schools now organise overseas learning experiences, and schools offer a wide variety of co-curricular activities (CCAs), such as fencing and sailing. NorthLight School also has an equestrian programme for its students. There are also smaller class sizes for the weaker students. Mr Ong explained that the additional resources for specialised schools and students in the Normal stream come partly in the form of additional teachers. “There is sometimes still the perception that students study in one class and it is of a certain size,” he said. “The reality is that students now regularly move around and join different groups, and there is no single class size.” “With good teachers, smaller class sizes help the students.” To lift the bottom, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim also noted in his speech that MOE is committed to ensuring equal access to opportunities for every child, from pre-school to adulthood. He talked about how his ministry is investing in three groups of students: Those from disadvantaged families, high-needs learners and students with special education needs. TWO PARADOXES OF EDUCATION In his speech, Mr Ong highlighted two paradoxes of education: meritocracy and inequality. Meritocracy, he explained, has uplifted many families over the decades, and these families spare no effort investing in the abilities of their children. But this has resulted in students from affluent families having a head start, and doing better than their peers from lower-income families. “Meritocracy, arising from a belief in fairness, seems to have paradoxically resulted in systemic unfairness,” he said. As for inequality, Mr Ong explained that as more poor families are successfully uplifted, those that remain poor face more difficult challenges, which are translated to their children’s performances in school. “So the more we uplift poor families, the greater the achievement gap between the rich and poor.” Mr Ong noted that as these paradoxes are confronted, questions are raised about whether MOE’s policies and approaches have run their course, and whether a “fundamentally different approach” should be taken – where some sacred cows will be slaughtered. “It depends on which cows you are thinking of slaughtering,” he said. “For some, my answer is No”. The “sacred cow” of PSLE, he said, has survived for some “very valid reasons”. “But what I think we need to do is to reduce the stakes of the examination, and there must be many ways we can do this,” he said. He agreed that PSLE is not a perfect system, and does add stress to some parents and students. “But it happens to be the most meritocratic, and probably the most fair of all imperfect systems,” he said. “If we scrap it, whatever we replace it with to decide on secondary school postings is likely to be worse.” There was another suggestion, he added, of setting a quota for low income students in popular schools. But he stressed that many popular schools are already making extra efforts to attract eligible students from low income families. “And we should encourage them to do more,” he said. “But setting a quota sends the wrong signal,” he added. “I don’t think it is aligned to our societal ethos, and could even be seen as patronising.” Rounding up his speech, Mr Ong said that tackling inequality is unfinished business. But he stressed that there is no contradiction between meritocracy and fairness, nor reducing inequality and raising collective standards.  \"Instead, we should double up on meritocracy, by broadening its definition to embrace various talents and skills,\" he said. \"We should not cap achievement at the top, but continue to strive to lift the bottom.\" MANY DIFFERENT PATHS TO SUCCESS: INDRANEE RAJAH  Weighing in on the discussion, Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah stressed that like the various Members of Parliament who spoke in the debate, MOE is aligned on the various broad objectives that were brought up. “We too want every child to have a bright future and to do well. Like the MPs who have spoken, we want them to have a wonderful school experience,” she said. “We are also concerned about the vulnerable, and we want integration and inclusivity to be at the heart of our education system.”   “Where we may differ in some aspects is on the strategies or solutions, but let me reassure the House that we are very much at one in terms of the overall aims and objectives of education.”   In her speech, Ms Indranee noted that much of the stress talked about is in fact driven by the assumption that there is only one path to success, which is the academic route. But in fact, she stressed that there are many different paths to success.   “Different children have different personalities, talents and abilities,” she said. “Some are more academically inclined, others are much better with their hands, or are more creative and artistic.”   Citing a report released by Dell Technologies which said that 85 per cent of the jobs in 2030 have not been invented yet, she said that future economy will be more diverse than today. And when the next generation of students enter the workforce, they may well take on jobs that have not even been conceived of today. “For that, you cannot have a system that is one-size-fits-all. Nor is there any longer a single measure of success, and learning has to be lifelong,” she said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ong-ye-kung-principles-singapore-education-system-10520356"}, {"datetime": "11 Jul 2018 07:53PM", "tags": ["rape", "crime", "court"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Wife of doctor accused of rape takes stand, shares difficulties in their sex life", "content": " SINGAPORE: The wife of a doctor accused of raping a female patient in 2015 took the witness stand on Wednesday (Jul 11) and said that she had difficulty having sex with her husband that year in new testimony that the prosecution alleged was \"an afterthought\" to help her husband's defence. Madam Quek Bee Nar, a real estate agent, gave evidence in the High Court through a Chinese interpreter. She has been married to general practitioner Wee Teong Boo for 40 years, the court heard, and they have five children aged 20 to 39. Wee, 67, is accused of raping a female patient, then 23, in a late night consultation on Dec 30, 2015, at his Bedok clinic. The victim, who cannot be named due to a gag order, made a police report the day after the alleged crime took place. Madam Quek had given a condition statement signed May 24 this year about the day's events, which was read in court on Wednesday.  In it, she detailed how her husband arrived home on Dec 31, 2015, accompanied by Assistant Superintendent Razali Razak, and was later taken to the Police Cantonment Complex.  She also described the phone calls her husband made to her later that day, saying he was going to be detained in the police lock-up.  A few days later in early January 2016, Madam Quek went down to the Police Cantonment Complex and gave a statement to a police officer. On Wednesday, Madam Quek asked for new points to be added to her condition statement dated May 24, 2018.  Among these statements were two points that the prosecution cross-examined her on: First, that she had been told by ASP Razali in January 2016 that her husband may be charged with rape, and second, that another police officer had asked her about her sex life with her husband while taking her statement that same month. The prosecution found that there were inconsistencies between Madam Quek's condition statement and the oral additions she gave in court on Wednesday and accused her of lying to help her husband. However, Justice Chua Lee Ming dismissed the prosecution's application to impeach her as a witness, saying that any inconsistency was not sufficiently material for an impeachment. \"VERY FAST\" Madam Quek told the court that the police officer who took her statement in January 2016 had asked her about her sex life with her husband. \"I said 'very fast',\" Madam Quek said. \"He asked me what that meant. I said 'he's old'. I didn't say in detail why it was 'fast', because he was a male police officer.\" When questioned by defence counsel Edmond Pereira, Madam Quek said that she had sex with her husband about once or twice a month in 2015. She explained that in 2015, when her husband wanted to have sex with her, his penis would be \"soft like a noodle\" and he needed to use his hand to guide himself. He also had difficulty maintaining and achieving an erection, she said. Wee had told the court in May that he had been seen by a urologist for erectile dysfunction and low libido. PROSECUTION ALLEGES THAT MADAM QUEK IS LYING Deputy Public Prosecutor Amanda Chong asked Madam Quek why she did not include this information in her statement before. In response, Madam Quek said it was her first time giving such a statement and that she went over the statement repeatedly at home afterwards and discovered upon recollection that she had left out some things. She denied that she had discussed this with her children or husband. Ms Chong said: \"In your mind, it was not possible for your husband to commit such a crime. So wouldn't you want to give all the evidence that would assist in clearing your husband's name?\" Madam Quek answered: \"I didn't have the experience of giving a statement (before). Also, I firmly believed that my husband would not do such a thing based on his character. I was too naive, thinking that the law is fair.\" DID NOT TELL POLICE ABOUT SEX LIFE AS SHE WAS EMBARRASSED Madam Quek repeatedly said that she did not tell the police officer about the difficulties in her sex life with her husband as she was \"embarrassed\" and also did not think her husband would be charged with rape. Madam Quek also said it did not occur to her that the questioning about her sex life had to do with the rape case. She said she thought the officer asked her that question to find out if their marriage \"was cordial\", which she said was so. \"You had the chance to tell the police that you were not always capable of sexual intercourse,\" the prosecutor said. \"If I had wanted to protect my husband I would have told them about my husband's erectile dysfunction earlier,\" Madam Quek retorted.  \"I put it to you that you are lying in court about your husband's inability to achieve rigidity,\" the prosecutor answered. She added that Madam Quek was \"creating all these details because you knew that your husband is accused of raping this girl while his hands were on her legs\". Madam Quek, who has been director of the clinic since 1984 but is not actively involved in clinic operations, disagreed.  \"If your husband truly had all these barriers, you would have told the police,\" the prosecutor said. \"The fact that none of these details were in your statement shows that you are lying in court today.\" Madam Quek appeared emotional at this point. She said: \"I disagree. I am someone who does not like to lie. And it is difficult for me to disclose the secrets between my husband and me. If I knew they were going to charge my husband, I would have told (the officer) our bedroom secrets. Because he was a male police officer and it was my first time meeting him in a small room, it was hard for me to reveal my secrets.\" When questioned by defence counsel Edmond Pereira, Madam Quek said she did not make the additions to her statement to defend her husband, but because she had forgotten to add them in.

Singapore exited the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) U-19 championship in Indonesia on Monday after four defeats and one draw, including thrashings by Laos (5-0), Thailand (6-0) and the hosts (4-0). The Football Federation of Australia (FFA) on Wednesday (Jul 11) confirmed that Servais helped the Socceroos as a scout for the World Cup with the blessings of FAS technical director (TD) Michel Sablon.  \"Our national technical director (Eric Adams) discussed the opportunity for Robbie with the Singapore TD and it was agreed that it would be beneficial for Robbie's development and therefore beneficial for Singapore football if Robbie was exposed to the FIFA World Cup from a personal development perspective,\" an FFA spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia.  Servais was appointed as the Singapore U-19 head coach in January this year, but began some scouting work the following month, the FFA confirmed. The arrangement ended after Australia were knocked out of the World Cup on Jun 26.  Servais joined up with the Socceroos while the U-19s were preparing for the AFF tournament, leaving the Cubs in the hands of his assistant Takuya Inoue. According to a source, Servais returned to the team only one day before they were due to fly off to Indonesia for the Jul 1-14 tournament.   Former Singapore international R Sasikumar said he was enraged when he found out about how Servais was allowed to leave the team when they were preparing for a key tournament.  \"We have to go back and ask what his role was in the past year. He's there to take the team for the tournament, his core job was the U-19 team and that's why he got the job,\" Sasikumar said.  \"And now the results are not coming, who is going to take the blame? I think they (FAS) have this lackadaisical attitude about football. For him to say I've got a better thing to do, I don't know which organisations would accept this. It's baffling, it's become so mediocre and the result shows.\"  A coach who wanted to remain anonymous also felt that Servais should have stuck with the team.  \"He should have been with them instead of going (to the World Cup). He's the coach of the team, he should have been focused on preparing them,\" he said.  \"But to be fair to the U-19 boys, they didn't have the best players, so that might have played a part with the results.\" EPISODE LEAVES \"A LOT TO BE DESIRED\" In a press release sent by FAS detailing the call-ups, Servais had said that \"quite a few players are unable to join us in this tournament\". It is understood that some Singapore Premier League clubs were unwilling to release their players because the league was ongoing.  Servais had also acknowledged that the team would be facing tough opponents, but he said they would \"put up a strong fight in this international tournament\". He added that the team will have \"adequate experience\".  But a parent of one of the players told Channel NewsAsia that the Under-19 boys didn't have the best of preparations. The parent added: \"One of the boys said that coach Taku (Takuya Inoue) could be seen crying at half time of the 5-0 defeat to Laos, and coach Robbie scolded the boys for almost one hour after the game.\"  Sasikumar said the whole episode left \"a lot to be desired\".  \"There should be a serious investigation on this. We should start from the top - whoever allowed him to go, he should go. The fact of the matter is the team went there, got pumped, and that's it,\" the 43-year-old said.  \"It's not about disappointment now, it's an embarrassing act. It's an embarrassment.

Jho Low, whose real name is Low Taek Jho, is wanted by the Malaysian authorities in an ongoing probe into the scandal-plagued 1MDB state fund. Low is believed to have fled Macau for an unknown destination. He was previously in Hong Kong.  The Singapore Police Force issued a statement on Wednesday to refute reports that claim Singapore had not made any requests to Hong Kong for the arrest and extradition of Low. Those reports are untrue, the police said. \"We issued a warrant of arrest for Low in April 2016, following investigations and charges against him for offences of money-laundering and dishonestly receiving stolen property,\" the police said.  Acting on information received, Singapore authorities sent a request to Hong Kong in the same month to arrest Low, the police added. However, Singapore's request was declined, police said. Singapore authorities had also asked INTERPOL to publish a Red Notice against Low. A Red Notice refers to a request by a country to locate and provisionally arrest a person based on a valid national arrest warrant.  \"To date, both the warrant of arrest and INTERPOL Red Notice against Low are in force.

Of these, 1,808 were in private homes and 390 in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats.  Mr Wong was responding to questions in Parliament on short-term home rentals by Members of Parliament Alex Yam, Melvin Yong and Lee Bee Wah. Currently, the minimum rental period for private homes and HDB flats in Singapore are three and six months respectively, meaning short-term lettings on platforms like Airbnb are prohibited. Enforcement notices will be issued for all these cases, said Mr Wong. \"A good majority of them will then stop, and immediately comply with the enforcement notice, but should there be cases that continue or there are egregious cases, then indeed, URA will work with AGC (Attorney-General's Chambers) on prosecution,\" he added. Earlier this year, two Singaporean Airbnb hosts were fined a total of S$60,000 each in the first such cases under new rules introduced in 2017. SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED REGULATIONS Following public feedback on a proposed regulatory framework for short-term letting, the URA will be further studying responses, before deciding how to take this issue forward, said Mr Wong. The public consultation exercise was conducted between Apr 16 to May 31 this year. \"Many respondents supported the need for regulations on STA, given that STA can cause negative externalities to other residents,\" Mr Wong said.  \"Key concerns raised include safety, security and privacy, as well as abuse of common property.  Many also supported regulating STA platform operators, for example, through a licensing framework.\" One of the proposals suggested in the framework was for the management corporation to obtain an 80 per cent consent from owners within a strata-titled residential development before STA can be permitted in any residential unit. \"There was mixed response to this proposal,\" said Mr Wong. \"Some respondents felt that an 80 per cent threshold would be unfair to the minority who do not support STA, but have to accept the presence of STA guests in their developments. \"On the other hand, there were others who felt that an 80 per cent threshold was too high, and that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient votes in support of STA among home-owners.\" The URA has also considered the impact of STAs on Singapore's hospitality industry, said Mr Wong, who added that the proposed regulatory framework includes controls similar to those imposed on the hospitality industry. These include requirements for STA hosts to collect and record the personal details of guests and to comply with fire safety regulations, as well as a proposal for platform operators to be licensed. \"The intent is to provide a more level playing field in the STA sector and the hospitality industry,\" Mr Wong added. \"Our approach to this has to be one that's based on fair competition.

The order for Boeing's 787s marks a new setback for Airbus in an intense battle for widebody orders as the European planemaker seeks to strengthen the order book for its upgraded A330neo passenger jet. Boeing posted figures on Tuesday showing a significant lead in new orders over its European rival, buoyed by demand for the 787 following a series of showdowns against the A330neo. Airbus said last week it saw good demand for the upgraded jet and is expected to announce orders soon. The Farnborough Airshow, which typically attracts large numbers of airline orders, will be held in Britain next week. Vistara joins rival Jet Airways and low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet that have plans to grow their international operations to offset a highly competitive, price-sensitive domestic market. \"India's position as the world's fastest growing domestic aviation market and its impressive growth in air passenger traffic that has more than doubled over the last decade makes us confident of our aggressive plans for domestic expansion and international foray,\" Vistara CEO Leslie Thng said in a statement on Wednesday. The joint venture between India's Tata Sons Ltd and Singapore Airlines Ltd, said it would procure another 37 A320neos from leasing companies and also had purchase rights over 4 more 787-9s and options over 7 more A320neos. The purchased and leased Airbus jets, fitted with CFM International LEAP engines, will be delivered between 2019 and 2023. The Boeing jets, to be powered by GE engines and used for medium and long-haul flights, are expected in 2020 and 2021.

The building houses the Amitabha Buddhist Society and also doubles as a place of lodging. Sim tried to open a few doors on the seventh floor and found that one door was unlocked. He entered the unit, where a kitchen assistant with Amitabha Buddhist Society was staying. The man, 25-year-old Lee Sai Hao, had left the door unlocked when he returned to work.

But from 2011 to 2017, real wages for resident workers rose by 1.9 per cent per annum, while productivity grew by only 1.1 per cent per annum over the same period, Dr Koh said. Elaborating, he said domestically-oriented sectors such as construction and other services - which include arts, health and social services - saw real wages rise faster than productivity due to labour market tightness, which led to upward pressures on wages.  \"Meanwhile, even though the sluggish global economic environment had weighed on the productivity performance of outward-oriented sectors over this period, real wage growth in these sectors was generally still supported by positive productivity growth,\" Dr Koh said.  In sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and finance and insurance, he said that real wages rose in tandem with productivity. However, in sectors such as transportation and storage, and accommodation, real wage growth exceeded productivity growth. Dr Koh said that over the long term, real wage growth should track productivity growth in order to be sustainable.  \"This is because if real wage growth outstrips productivity growth for an extended period, businesses will be at risk of losing their competitiveness and potentially be forced to scale back or close their operations,\" he added.  Dr Koh added that it is \"crucial\" to press on with driving productivity to maintain Singapore's competitiveness globally and to continue improving Singaporeans' wages and living standards.  \"I think the key is that wage growth will not be uniform across all sectors and fundamental to driving sustainable wage growth would be to improve productivity. \"So it is one of the important tenets of the Industry Transformation Maps that we want to help companies to better increase productivity by leveraging on technology such that the companies can make better profit margins while controlling their costs from various pressures,\" he added.  Government assistance through schemes designed to help firms enhance their capability and productivity are also bearing fruit. He said firms that tapped on the Capability Development Grant (CDG) managed by Enterprise Singapore for capability improvement projects between 2005 and 2012 experienced a 9.3 per cent increase in revenue on average over time. Productivity improvement projects had the largest impact, raising firms’ revenue by 12.4 per cent, compared to 7.8 per cent for technology innovation projects and an average of 6.7 per cent for the remaining project areas, Dr Koh said. “The Government is committed to continue to work with businesses and the unions to help businesses improve their productivity, and ensure that the productivity gains are shared with workers through higher wages.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/annual-real-wage-growth-of-1-9-per-cent-in-recent-years-10519408"}, {"datetime": "11 Jul 2018 10:44AM", "tags": ["trade", "EU"], "author": "Brandon Tanoto", "title": "Singapore to push for quick EU ratification of free trade deal ", "content": " BRUSSELS: Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing is expected to push for the speedy ratification of the European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement when he meets with his EU counterparts in Brussels and Paris on Wednesday (Jul 11) and Thursday, respectively. The aim is for the agreement to come into force by next year, before the European Commission’s mandate ends. This comes against the backdrop of the trade conflict between the US and China, which Mr Chan described in Parliament on Monday as a spat that could “significantly impact” Singapore’s open economy. US tariffs on US$34 billion worth of Chinese goods kicked in last Friday and in response, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on a similar scale. Washington on Tuesday announced it will slap 10 per cent tariffs on another US$200 billion in Chinese export goods as soon as September.  Private-sector economists have said that the escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies could disrupt the global supply chain.  For instance, Singapore companies that produce immediate goods used in the production of China's exports to the US may see lower demand for their goods. As such, Mr Chan said Singapore's strong trading networks are important because they will help these companies seek out alternative suppliers and new markets. The EUSFTA is one form of such trading networks, and when ratified, will be the first deal between the EU and an ASEAN country. The agreement will have significant benefits for businesses and consumers, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said. Besides eliminating tariffs on qualifying goods and removing custom duties on e-commerce, it will also open up more government procurement opportunities for businesses. Singapore and the EU first launched negotiations of the agreement in 2009 and concluded them in 2014. In April this year, the European Commission presented the negotiation outcomes to the European Council. For now, this initial agreement needs to be approved by the Council of Ministers and ratified by the European Parliament. Singapore is the EU’s largest commercial partner in ASEAN, accounting for nearly one-third of EU-ASEAN trade in goods and services and about two-thirds of investment between the two regions. Meanwhile, the EU is Singapore’s biggest investor and third-largest trading partner - with bilateral trade up 5.6 per cent on-year, hitting S$98.4 billion last year, according to MTI. While in Paris, Mr Chan will reaffirm Singapore’s bilateral economic ties with France, and seek France’s continued support for the EUSFTA, through meetings with French leaders, the ministry said.

All of these are tightly-guarded family recipes by 66-year-old Peck Teck Neo, after whom the place was named (“makko” is Peranakan for “aunty”). “They’re recipes from my mother and my mother-in-law. I also read books and try to improve on dishes. What I like to make, I make,” said Mdm Peck, who runs the place together with her husband, Lim Kian Beng, 70, and their two sons Dennis and Danny, who are both in their early 40s. FROM PINEAPPLE TARTS IN THE KITCHEN Today, it’s the humble Nyonya fare that draws a steady stream of customers to Makko Teck Neo, from nearby office workers on the weekdays to families on weekends. But the place wouldn’t even have existed had it not been for one particular Chinese New Year treat – pineapple tarts. Back in the late 1980s, the family ran a small side business selling pineapple tarts to friends and business contacts, which they would make from their home kitchen in the Loyang area. Soon after, both Mdm Peck and Mr Lim were retrenched from their respective companies, and they decided to focus on the tarts, which proved very popular. “Back then it was very much homemade and taking small orders. We’d be getting orders during Chinese New Year and at some point, there was an overwhelming demand,” said son Dennis, who recalled those hectic days when they’d be doing “a few thousand tarts a day” together with his aunts, who’d help out. “My brother and I studied overseas but when we had our term breaks and our friends would have their holidays, we’d come back to help prepare the pineapple jam. Back then, we didn’t have a commercial oven so our last bake would be completed at midnight or one in the morning. Then we’d wait two hours for the tarts to cool before we wrapped them. At three or four o’clock we’d still be wrapping. Then we’d have two, three hours of sleep before starting the entire process all over again!” But while the pineapple tarts were a hit, that wasn’t the only secret recipe in the household’s arsenal. Mdm Peck’s dry mee siam and nasi lemak were already popular among friends, who often urged them to sell these as well – so the family started distributing packets to factories as well as to establishments like Zouk, for its employees. THE LITTLE NYONYA GIVES A BIG BOOST The family took a big leap in 2008, when they decided to go big. Aside from briefly running the cafeteria at Novena Church, they also opened their Telok Blangah Rise outlet. “It’s definitely an ulu place and no one actually walks by here, but we were fortunate to have some regular customers, who spread the news through word of mouth,” said Dennis. They started off selling a few items, such as their kuehs and pineapple tarts, assam prawns, chicken wings and their signature dry mee siam and nasi lemak. While there were other typical Peranakan dishes they could’ve served, such as chap chye, babi pongteh and ayam buah keluak, it took a while for them to include these, admitted Mr Lim. “We had the wrong impression that not many people knew how to eat these items, but it turned out quite a lot knew how to appreciate the dishes,” he said. His son Dennis admitted: “Back then, there weren’t many notable Peranakan shops around and the cuisine wasn’t as popular as it is right now. Back then, if you went out with friends, it was either you went to a Chinese restaurant or for western food. The last thing people would choose was Peranakan food.” But that year, the shop – and Peranakan food – got a big boost from an unlikely source. “There was the TV serial on Channel 8, The Little Nyonya, and it became a big craze. In each episode, the main character prepares a dish, and whenever these came out, people would come and ask whether we had this particular kueh or dish,” said Dennis, who revealed that one of the episodes actually encouraged them to put out what would eventually become one of their signature kuehs, the rempah udang. Their pineapple tarts, too, continued to be a hit – they were included in a Singapore Sampler menu for a dinner held for dignitaries during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in 2009. KEEPING BUSY, KEEPING IT REAL  Despite Peranakan cuisine becoming more mainstream – and with places like Candlenut, True Blue Cuisine and The National Kitchen By Violet Oon earning raves and a Michelin star or two – the family has decided to stick to its guns. Expansion has been slow. They only just opened a take-away kiosk at Tang Plaza last year, and while they’re amenable to exploring other ways of growing Makko Teck Neo, such as going into food courts, they’re in no hurry to look for investors or partners. Just like how it all began years ago – whether it’s making pineapple tarts in their home kitchen or preparing packets of mee siam for factories – the most important thing for them is maintaining the quality of the food. Their homemade pineapple tarts – which they still continue to make, although not in the same quantities as before – earned them a shout-out from the Slow Food Singapore movement a couple of years ago. And to this day, there’s still very much a hands-on vibe in the kitchen. Mdm Peck still personally cooks the ayam buah keluak and chap chye, while closely supervising their cooks for the rest of the dishes. Meanwhile, it’s not unusual to see Mr Lim carrying large bags of onion, garlic and other ingredients to the kitchen, too. “Everything is made from scratch. We do our own rempah (spice paste), which is very much my mum’s recipe,” said Dennis. “And I still remember what one of our customers said to us - that ever since his mum died, this was the closest he could get to eating home-cooked food. At the end of the day, we just want to share a little home-cooked food with everyone.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/peranakan-food-restaurant-singapore-telok-blangah-makko-teck-neo-10512260"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 11:40PM", "tags": ["Thailand cave rescue", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "", "title": "PM Lee Hsien Loong hails rescuers behind 'complex operation' to save 12 Thai boys and coach", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday (Jul 10) hailed the rescuers who helped save the 12 Thai boys and their football coach stranded in a cave, calling the \"complex operation\" a \"remarkable display of strength of the human spirit\". \"Delighted & relieved that the 12 Thai boys & their football coach have been successfully rescued from the Tham Luang cave,\" Mr Lee wrote in a Facebook post late on Tuesday night. \"It is an inspiring tale of what different nations and groups can achieve by working together,\" he added.  All 12 boys from the \"Wild Boar\" football team and their coach were rescued on Tuesday evening from a flooded Thai cave complex where they had been trapped for more than two weeks. The last five trapped in the Tham Luang cave were evacuated on Tuesday, the third day of the rescue operation. A medic and all navy SEAL divers had also left the cave safely, said chief of the rescue mission Narongsak Osottanakorn. The Thai army had sent more than 1,000 personnel to help in the rescue efforts. \"It was heartening to see so many prayers and suggestions for the Wild Boars’ safe rescue – this saga has touched many around the world,\" Mr Lee wrote in his post. The \"Wild Boars\" football team and their coach got trapped on Jun 23 when they set out to explore the vast cave complex after soccer practice, when a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels. British divers found the 13, huddled on a muddy bank in a partly flooded chamber several kilometres inside the complex, on Monday last week. The eight boys brought out on Sunday and Monday were in good health overall and some asked for chocolate bread for breakfast, officials said. Two of the boys had suspected lung infections but the four boys from the first group rescued were all walking around their hospital beds. \"I wish all those rescued a smooth and quick recovery from their ordeal (hopefully in time for the World Cup final this Sunday :) ),\" Mr Lee said in his post. World football governing body FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Jul 6 had written a message of support for the boys, and extended an invitation to the team to attended the World Cup final in Moscow as FIFA's guest. Doctors have said the boys will have to remain in hospital for a while and will not be able to attend the World Cup final. In his post on Tuesday night, Mr Lee also paid tribute to the Thai and international rescuers and volunteers who contributed to the operation, including retired Navy Petty Officer First Class Saman Kunan, who died delivering oxygen tanks into the cave. \"All of them showed great heart and resilience during this rescue, which succeeded thanks to their efforts,\" Mr Lee said.

A total of 20 Members debated the scheme, which was designed based on the recommendations of an ElderShield Review Committee. Several MPs said that the differentiation makes the scheme less inclusive. MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Lily Neo said that some women might find it harder to pay for premiums and urged Health Minister Gan Kim Yong to reconsider the higher premiums for women. Workers’ Party’s (WP's) Sylvia Lim echoed the same view. She pointed to an article by a professor from the London School of Economics, which argued that social insurance schemes for long-term care should not take into account the gender difference in premiums. According to the article, many women take up unpaid work to care for their families, and women are much more likely to remain outside the labour force.  BIGGER PROPORTION OF WOMEN EXPECTED TO BECOME SEVERELY DISABLED: AMY KHOR Responding to Dr Neo, Ms Lim, and others who brought up the same point, Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor said that the ElderShield Review Committee had debated this topic extensively and that it was not an easy decision to make.  “While we have designed CareShield Life to be inclusive, it is equally important for the scheme to be equitable and sustainable. To that end, premiums must be actuarially sound,” she said. Women live longer than men, and are therefore more likely to spend more years in severe disability, she explained. To underline the need for differentiation, she said that last year, the average life expectancy at birth for women was 85.2 years, compared to 80.7 years for men.  Three in five healthy women at age 65 are expected to become severely disabled, compared to two in five healthy men at age 65, she said. She also pointed to a longitudinal survey of older Singaporeans in 2009 and 2011 to 2012, in which researchers estimated women aged 60 are expected to spend 7.8 years requiring assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) compared to 2.6 years for men aged 60. In order for a person to be defined as severely disabled and make a claim from CareShield Life, he or she has to be unable to perform at least three of the six ADLs independently. These are washing, dressing, feeding, using the toilet, moving around and the ability to transfer oneself from a bed to a chair.  The committee did consider that women have less savings on average, and the costs could therefore be better supported by the men, she added. “However, on balance, the Committee decided that applying gender-differentiated premiums for CareShield Life would more accurately reflect the differences in risk between men and women, and result in a more sustainable scheme,” she said.  RELAX CRITERIA FOR CLAIMS, INCREASE PAYOUT MPs also asked if the Government would consider reviewing the eligibility requirements for claimants. MP for Hougang SMC Png Eng Huat said that the definition of severe disability has remained “untouched” over the past years during reviews of Eldershield, and is too “restrictive” when insured persons have to file a claim.  “Not being able to do one of the six ADLs is already a challenge for most of us in this House,\" he said, and emphasised his party’s call to review the ADLs test.  MP for Bukit Batok SMC Murali Pillai urged a more measured approach and questioned if the affordability of premiums and impact on government subsidies will be affected if claims are made easier.  He said he was concerned about the impact of lowering the threshold on the premiums.  \"Would the premiums remain affordable? If not, how much more subsidy is expected from the Government?” he asked. The annual premium is expected to be S$206 for a man who turns 30 years old in 2020, and S$253 for a woman. These figures do not include subsidies. Dr Lily Neo, Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Melvin Yong also asked whether S$600 per month, the proposed starting payout, will be enough, and if payout increases can continue for life even after a claim is made. Mr Chee Hong Tat, who was Senior Minister of State for Health till April this year, addressed these suggestions and questions. The Committee discussed these ideas and carefully considered the trade-offs between further increasing the payout amount and lowering the claims criterion versus the need to keep premiums affordable in a universal insurance scheme, he said. He illustrated how premiums would rise, should payouts be increased and the criteria relaxed. “If we raise the payout amount from S$600 to S$800 per month, premiums for a 30-year-old male in 2020 could increase by about one-third,” he said. He added that if additionally, the claims criterion is lowered from three ADLs to two, premiums will further increase by a third. As a result, the annual starting premium will be about 70 per cent higher than the currently proposed premium. CALL FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol Zainal Sapari and MP for Nee Soon GRC Lee Bee Wah also asked for the actuarial considerations and premium impact, if the Government were to include those with pre-existing severe disabilities in the existing cohorts from CareShield Life. Addressing their questions, Dr Khor said the proportion of Singaporeans who are severely disabled in old age is much higher. “About 7 per cent of Singaporeans aged 65 and above today are severely disabled, compared to less than 0.1 per cent of Singaporeans aged between 30 and 40,” she said.  She cautioned that including the severely disabled from existing cohorts in CareShield Life would significantly increase premiums by about 30 per cent for the rest of policyholders in these cohorts. WP MP Pritam Singh and Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera called for more transparency in the mechanism behind premiums. “To arrest unnecessary speculation and misinformation about CareShield Life, the Government should commit to publish and be absolutely transparent about the actuarial principles and factors that drive premium hikes, including the investment returns on CareShield Life moving forward,” he said.  In acknowledging MPs’ views that CareShield Life is not easy for Singaporeans to understand, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that the Government will initiate more communications and engagement efforts. Wrapping up the debate, he said: “We will work with community partners and stakeholders to reach out to Singaporeans. We will continue to explain the schemes to Singaporeans and how they can tap on them to support their long-term care needs.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mps-question-gender-based-premiums-criteria-for-disability-10517344"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 07:01PM", "tags": ["property", "cooling measures", "stamp duty"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Stamp duty collected rose 46% in 2017: Heng Swee Keat ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The amount of stamp duty collected by the Government rose by 45.9 per cent in 2017, with most of the receipts from property transactions, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat revealed on Tuesday (Jul 10). This is up from the 14.2 per cent increase in stamp duty collected in 2016 and the 6.2 per cent decrease recorded in 2015. In a written response to a Parliamentary question by MP Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Heng also said that S$2.2 billion in stamp duties have already been collected in the first five months of this year. He did not provide the value of the stamp duty collected in the previous years. Stamp duty is payable on instruments which effect a transfer of interest in properties, and stocks or shares in Singapore.  Stamp duties have been in the spotlight this week after the Government announced on Jul 5 surprise cooling measures including tighter loan limits and a hike in Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for some buyers. The curbs, the Government said, were part of efforts to \"cool the property market and keep price increases in line with economic fundamentals\".   In his written reply on Tuesday, Mr Heng also said that S$2.2 billion in property taxes have been collected in the first five months of the year. The percentage changes in property tax collection over the last three years are: +4.2 per cent in 2015, -1.3 per cent in 2016 and +0.4 per cent in 2017. The cooling measures implemented last week came a day after Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director Ravi Menon called for caution amid “euphoria” in the property market.  Flash estimates released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed that private home prices had jumped by 9.1 per cent year-on-year in the April-to-June period, with analysts predicting that prices could soon recover to 2013 peak levels.  This prompted crowds of potential buyers to flood showflats across Singapore until late into that evening.

Back then, the airspace management coordinator was thrilled to watch fighter jets pull off aerobatic stunts and military helicopters fly in formation. “At that point of time, I believe I was still too young and didn’t really understand the complexity of how all these aerial displays can be done,” said CPT Lim. “But now that I’m in this line of service, I think that this is actually not an easy task.” The 29-year-old was referring to his job of coordinating this year’s NDP flypast as the parade’s overall exercise coordinator. “What people don’t see is that there is actually a team behind the scenes in the ops room. They are ensuring that all these aircraft are safe and well de-conflicted from each other,” said CPT Lim. He is responsible for designing and translating a comprehensive plan for his team, 203 Squadron, which is made up of 10 air traffic controllers at five main control zones for this year’s parade. His task is no easy feat, especially since this year’s NDP coincides with the Republic of Singapore Airforce’s (RSAF) 50th birthday. To commemorate its anniversary, the RSAF has promised an “enhanced” aerial display, which boasts one of the most complex aerial designs. It also happens to be CPT Lim’s first time as overall in-charge. “One of the challenges would be translating the plans from the higher-ups back to the squadron and that usually has to be done within a short period of time,” said CPT Lim. “As a coordinator, I will have to translate these plans in a manner such that my controllers know and understand the plan. I’m also responsible for ensuring the contingency plans will be at their fingertips.” Training for air traffic controllers began as early as May this year, with rehearsals happening three to four times a week and combined rehearsals taking place every Saturday. RSAF Captain Seah Guo Jin, 26, is the main controller for the aerial display and is also part of 203 Squadron. He works closely with CPT Lim. They are both stationed at the Singapore Air Traffic Control Centre in Changi. “My role requires me to talk to more than 20 aircraft in the air … and that’s the main excitement. Each pilot has their own demands, timings and targets to meet,” said CPT Seah. “As a controller, I need to manage them and ensure that their demands are being met while flight safety is maintained. It is a job that requires quite a bit of mental capacity and a fair bit of confidence.” Despite the sheer intensity of the job, which requires them to stay glued to their radar screens, both men say it is a “refreshing and fulfilling” experience. “At the end of the day if I have managed to complete the entire aerial display and execute it perfectly, I will go home feeling satisfied that my family and friends get to enjoy a spectacular show,” said CPT Seah. “This gives me a very warm feeling in my heart when I make my way back and meet my family.” “I will take pride and say that my job is definitely not boring. Consider the fact after this NDP, I can always pose a question: ‘Have you ever talked to more than 20 pilots at one point in time?’ If the answer is no, I’ll take it that I brought my point across.” On a day-to-day basis, the team works with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and provides search-and-rescue operations when the need arises. In less than a month, the 203 Squadron will be back to its usual business. In the meantime, rehearsals for Aug 9 are underway and for CPT Lim, his wish to watch the parade \"live\" will not happen any time soon. “Even though we are not physically at the show centre, I feel that we are emotionally there because whenever my friends are near Marina Centre, they will tell me about the number of aircraft they see, and the formations that fly past. I feel very happy when they tell me it was a good show,” said CPT Lim. “And I will tell them, that’s my job.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-national-day-talking-to-21-pilots-air-traffic-control-10516018"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 06:29PM", "tags": ["crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Man who defied driving ban, used forged driving licence jailed", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 57-year-old man who was disqualified from driving not only ignored the ban, he went ahead to drive while intoxicated and produced a forged driving licence when he was approached by the police.  For the offences, Tan Siew Jing was on Tuesday (Jul 10) sentenced to 22 weeks' jail and a fine of S$1,000.

Citing the devastation of 2013's Super Typhoon Haiyan that swept through northern Southeast Asia, causing more than 6,000 deaths - Mr Masagos warned that worse storms may hit.  “That is what scientists are telling us can happen if we do nothing about climate change,” he said. Apart from capacity building, Mr Masagos said Singapore will also lend its support in other areas. It is supporting the establishment of the first Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF), which will be set up in Singapore in 2019. The risk pool is meant to provide immediate liquidity to cover emergency response costs in the aftermath of regional catastrophes. The Meteorological Service Singapore will also contribute S$5 million in a five-year regional capability development programme, which will begin this year. The programme aims to benefit ASEAN countries through the sharing of technical knowledge and skills in weather and climate prediction, to help the region better adapt its policies to climate change.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-to-help-asean-better-tackle-climate-change-with-new-10516760"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 05:09PM", "tags": ["crime", "accident"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Driver in fatal cyclist accident fined, banned from driving for 3 years", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 62-year-old man who accidentally drove his vehicle into a cyclist three years ago, causing his death, was fined S$9,000 on Tuesday (Jul 10). He was also banned from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for three years. Tee Thiam Chye had been driving his car along Ophir Road towards East Coast Parkway at about 6.30am on May 23, 2015, to meet his friends for breakfast. It was drizzling at the time and the surface of the road was wet, court documents said. As he approached the junction of Ophir Road and Beach Road, he was travelling at a speed between 83kmh and 91kmh. The speed limit along Ophir Road is 60kmh. He noticed the lights were green in his favour and maintained this speed as he crossed the junction. At the same time, the cyclist, 78-year-old Abdul Rahim Abdullah, started to cycle across the three lanes at the pedestrian crossing. He was cycling from Tee's left to Tee's right and he was crossing the road on a red-man signal, court documents said. Tee saw the cyclist and shouted at him, but was unable to stop in time and collided with the cyclist. At 6.36am, the police received a call from a member of the public who said: \"I knocked down one cyclist.

But he first moved to caution that different groups of Singaporeans have different concerns.  “Elderly Singaporeans, retirees and their families will be more concerned with healthcare affordability,” he described. “Families with young children and infants may be more concerned with the prices of milk powder and educational programmes. Yet other families may be aspiring to buy their dream house or car. “No single measure will express an individual’s ‘cost of living’ pressures fully, given the different needs and wants, the evolving aspirations and the potential gap between aspirations and anticipated means.” Mr Chan added that certain items consumed daily, such as water and transport fares, could produce a disproportionate psychological impact despite not having the biggest absolute impact.  “The ‘bunching' of price increases, like the increases in water and electricity prices this month, can also have a disproportionate psychological impact,” he said. The Minister noted how there are absolute measures of how prices of a particular basket of goods and services change over time, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). But there are also factors beyond the Government’s control - such as global economic forces and Singapore’s market size. Mr Chan then outlined the Government’s eight-point strategy for managing the cost of living in Singapore: By keeping the economy competitive; managing the Singapore dollar; diversifying sources of supply; promoting competition; managing the cost of doing business; focusing help schemes to do more for those with less; enabling consumers’ choice and lastly leveraging social enterprises. NOT JUST ABOUT LOWER-INCOME Later, in response to an additional question from Member of Parliament Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Chan stressed that it was not just lower-income groups the Government was concerned with. “Of course as a general policy we try to do more for the lower-income and perhaps the retirees first,” he said. “Having said that, the Government is very aware of the aspirations and needs of the middle-income group. That is why we have a broad-based swathe of measures that I have alluded to help everyone. “We try to help everyone in Singapore by making sure that those with the least get the most, but that doesn’t mean that those with more don’t get anything. It’s just a tiering of the help schemes that we have.” Mr Chan continued: “For many of the middle-income … We try to do as much as we can to help their seniors, to relieve the burden of the middle-income households with elderly parents. “We want to make sure that their children’s education remains affordable and everyone will have similar opportunities to excel and to fulfil their potential. Our promise as a Government is, so long as someone is capable and committed, they should not need to have to worry about their means, their family circumstances. That’s why we give out as many scholarships, as many bursary awards as possible to help our students excel.\" In his response earlier, he concluded: “Cost of living pressures will always be present in various forms. Managing the challenges is never-ending work ...  Most importantly, we recognise Singaporeans’ evolving aspirations for a better life for ourselves and our families, and the associated stress of achieving real income growth in a volatile economic environment.” By ensuring every Singaporean has a good job; helping Singaporeans stretch their hard-earned dollar; and giving the most help to those who may need a bit more - these are the ways the Government is committed to tackling the cost of living issue, said Mr Chan.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chan-chun-sing-singapore-cost-of-living-10516462"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 03:27PM", "tags": ["Temasek", "investments"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Temasek’s net portfolio value hits record high of S$308 billion", "content": " SINGAPORE: Temasek Holdings on Tuesday (Jul 10) reported a record net portfolio value for the last financial year – its second in a row – but the Singapore investment company said it plans to slow its investment pace amid the probability of increasing downside risks in the near term.  Its net portfolio value rose to S$308 billion for the financial year ended Mar 31, up 12 per cent from S$275 billion a year ago, Temasek said in its annual review.  “Our net portfolio value passed the S$300 billion mark for the first time. It is now almost three times the dot-com peak of just over S$100 billion at the turn of the millennium,” said Temasek International’s CEO and executive director Lee Theng Kiat in a statement.  Good global economic momentum and buoyant equity markets were the main drivers for its portfolio value. In particular, Asia-Pacific was a key outperformer , with Chinese banks among the biggest contributors, said Temasek’s joint head of portfolio strategy and risk Rohit Sipahimalani.  Its latest set of numbers also showed one-year total shareholder return at just over 12 per cent, compared with 13 per cent a year ago.  Temasek invested S$29 billion and divested S$16 billion from Apr 1, 2017, to Mar 31, 2018 – a reversal from the earlier financial year when divestments exceeded investments for the first time since the year ended 2009. Over the last decade, it invested S$203 billion and divested S$150 billion.  It also noted that it ended the year in a net cash position. “Our cash and bank balances, together with our short-term investments, were a robust four times the S$8.5 billion debt we have due over the next decade,” the annual review said.  The United States accounted for the largest share of investments during the financial year, followed by China and Europe. Mature economies form 60 per cent of Temasek’s portfolio while growth economies, such as Latin America and Africa, make up the remaining 40 per cent.  Overall, Singapore remained the bulk of Temasek's portfolio at 27 per cent though an evolving portfolio has seen Europe and the Americas growing in size to form almost a quarter of the firm’s underlying portfolio exposure.  Its two biggest sectors continued to be financial services (26 per cent) and telecommunications, media and technology (21 per cent).  Temasek said it has been increasing its focus in sectors such as technology, life sciences, agribusiness, non-bank financial services and consumer, over the past seven years. From S$9 billion or 5 per cent of a smaller portfolio in 2011, its exposure to these sectors now make up S$80 billion or 26 per cent of the firm’s total portfolio.  During the last financial year, nearly half of the new investments, totalling about S$13 billion, went into these focus sectors.  Given how returns from these sectors have outperformed the total portfolio return, the change in focus has had a positive impact on the firm’s returns, said managing director of investment Alphin Mehta.  Beyond this, the state investor is also eyeing new global trends for its future investments. Among the six identified, longer lifespans have created investment opportunities in biopharmaceutical companies while the rise of the sharing economy has fuelled the birth of sharing platforms like Go-Jek and Airbnb.  TO SLOW INVESTMENT PACE AMID INCREASING DOWNSIDE RISKS For the year ahead, Temasek is generally positive in its outlook but expects global growth to moderate.  There is a probability of increased downside risks in the near term, said managing director of investment Tay Sulian.  As such, Temasek continues to maintain a “disciplined approach” and given the market outlook, it may “recalibrate and slow (its) investment pace over the next nine to 18 months”, said Mr Mehta, though he stressed that there remains a “robust pipeline of opportunities” this year.  The risks ahead include escalating trade tensions between the US and China, but head of strategy Michael Buchanan said the state investment firm does “not expect a full-blown trade war with punitive tariffs on a wide range of goods in a wide range of countries” to materialise.  However, \"a period of significant trade tensions\" will likely continue and Temasek will be watching to see if the conflict intensifies to involve other countries. “The tariffs that have been in place so far have been relatively small and do not have a huge impact on growth but obviously, we are worried that this could escalate,” he told reporters.  “One thing we are watching is whether these tensions go beyond the US, China and move to other countries … That’s when you will have an increase in (the) risk of broader trade tensions.” Another medium-term risk is monetary and financial stresses in some key economies, with a rising risk of a recession in the US being something that Temasek said it will be watching out for.  “With the economy running above capacity and a fiscal boost in the late stage of the economic cycle, the risk of overheating has increased. Against this backdrop, we are pacing our investments and focused on our intrinsic value-based approach,” said Ms Tay.  On how it views Singapore’s latest property cooling measures, Mr Buchanan said they are “unlikely to have a broad macro impact” to the local economy though some hits to the sector will be unavoidable.  When asked if it is concerned about possible spillover effects to the local banking sector, specifically on its key investment DBS, Temasek’s head of financial services Png Chin Yee told Channel NewsAsia that a significant long-term impact on the local lender is unlikely.  “DBS has built multiple engines of growth (over) the last few years, both in Singapore as well as in the region.

It will provide better protection and assurance for all Singaporeans who join the scheme, through higher payouts for life for those who are severely disabled,” he said. He was opening a parliamentary debate on the Eldershield Review Committee Report, which was the basis for the design of CareShield Life.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the review of ElderShield at the 2016 National Day Rally to provide better support for Singaporeans who become severely disabled during their old age. The ElderShield Review Committee was appointed in October that year, and submitted its report in May 2018.  CareShield Life will expand the role of insurance, one of three key components of long-term care financing system. The other two are personal and family savings, and Government or community assistance and support. Mr Gan underscored the need for such long-term care financing through sobering projected figures- 1 in 2 Singaporeans who is healthy at age 65  is expected to be severely disabled at some point in their lifetime and require long-term care. “Some are surprised by our ‘1-in-2’ statistic, and ask why is it that we do not see half of our elderly in severe disability,” he said, explaining that this is simply because they do not all become severely disabled at the same time.  MINIMISING INTER-GENERATIONAL TRANSFERS Mr Gan said that each cohort paying for its own needs minimises inter-generational transfers, and avoids passing the burden to future generations and keeps the scheme sustainable. A pay-as-you-go system, where funds collected in a particular year, often through taxes, and used to pay the claims for that year, would mean that the younger working population would be funding the claims made mostly by seniors, most of whom have stopped working. “This is not sustainable especially for an ageing population, where the number of seniors is growing at a much faster pace than that of the younger working population,” he said. There is also uncertainty on the duration a person remains severely disabled, he added. While the median duration of disability is four years, 3 in 10 could remain severely disabled for 10 years or more.  “If we save for 4 years of disability, but remain disabled for 10 years, we would not have saved enough. If we saved for 10 years, but we have been disabled for less, we would have over-saved. Insurance helps this situation through risk-pooling, he said. Long-term care needs, and how much people save individually for future needs, are difficult to predict with great accuracy, he added. CARESHIELD LIFE TO HAVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE, LOWER ENROLMENT AGE Mr Gan took the House through the features of CareShield Life, which was first unveiled on May 27.  Among the features would be the lower enrolment age of 30, compared to ElderShield's 40, the compulsory nature of the scheme, and the Government administration of the scheme.  It will also have universal coverage. The Government will set up an insurance fund which will be ringfenced for CareShield Life. The fund will be administered by the Central Provident Fund Board. Beyond CareShield Life, the Government will also allow Medisave cash withdrawals with certain conditions, and set up ElderFund, a new financial assistance scheme for people aged 30 and above, and have severe disability.  \"Preparing for our old age needs is often of low priority when we are younger, as we tend to focus more on building our career and bringing up our children, which is understandable. But starting to prepare only when we are old would be very challenging,\" he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/health-minister-gan-kim-yong-reiterates-importance-of-careshield-10515954"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 01:14PM", "tags": ["defence", "ragging"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Additional physical training as informal punishment allowed in SAF if guidelines followed: Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: Informal punishment in the form of additional physical training is allowed in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), provided they follow stipulated guidelines, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in Parliament on Tuesday (Jul 10). The punishment meted out should also be commensurate with commanders' seniority. Dr Ng was responding to a question from Workers’ Party Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Dennis Tan, who had asked if any form of ragging was allowed in the SAF. “Additional physical training as a form of informal punishment can only be meted out in accordance with stipulated guidelines and based on commanders’ seniority as prescribed in the SAF Joint Manpower Directive (4-4) on the Informal Punishment System,” Dr Ng said. Channel NewsAsia understands that the directive outlines the informal disciplinary power of commanders and the rules governing its implementation. Commanders can use these powers, commensurate with their seniority, to deal with minor mistakes and offences committed by servicemen under their command. For example, a section commander can dish out a maximum of up to 20 push-ups, a platoon sergeant up to 30 push-ups, and an officer commanding up to 50 push-ups.  “For all activities, the safety of individual soldiers is paramount and commanders must take corrective measures to mitigate risks to their soldiers, where necessary,\" Dr Ng added. While military training aims to build up the physical and psychological resilience of soldiers, Dr Ng said, their safety need not be compromised. “Acts of humiliation are specifically prohibited.” To that end, he said training activities need to be authorised and clearly outlined with safety measures and limits. The requirement for each activity is an approved safety management plan with a Supervising Officer, Conducting Officer and Safety Officer present throughout. Similarly, Dr Ng said, unit orientation activities can only be conducted if authorised and do not endanger the well-being of servicemen. Dr Ng reiterated that SAF personnel who conduct unauthorised activities, engage in bullying or have wilfully or negligently not complied with training safety regulations “have been and will continue to be severely dealt with”. This includes prosecution either by Summary Trials or the General Court Martial within the SAF, or criminal prosecution in the State Courts, he said. For example, Dr Ng pointed to a 2016 case involving four NSFs who were prosecuted in the Military Court for bullying a fellow NSF. All were sentenced to between two and four weeks in the SAF Detention Barracks. Earlier in 2012, a Conducting Officer who appointed a serviceman to drive a military vehicle even though he knew the serviceman did not have a driving licence was convicted in the criminal courts and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. The serviceman had died after the SAF vehicle he was in overturned during an exercise. The officer was found to have committed a rash act and attempted to pervert the course of justice. “SAF soldiers are encouraged to report any unauthorised activity or punishment,” Dr Ng said, highlighting that they can do it through their unit superiors, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) Feedback Unit or the respective services’ safety hotlines. “New recruits are specifically briefed on how they can do so.” Dr Ng added that every complaint is investigated fully and those caught doing wrong will be prosecuted. “MINDEF and the SAF take a zero tolerance approach towards any form of abuse of soldiers or personnel, either by their commanders or peers.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/additional-physical-training-informal-punishment-allowed-in-saf-10515724"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 12:12PM", "tags": ["personal data", "cybersecurity", "PDPA"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore Taekwondo Federation fined S$30,000 after minors' NRIC numbers disclosed", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Taekwondo Federation has been fined S$30,000 after the NRIC numbers of 782 minors were disclosed via PDF documents on its website. The issue was discovered on May 19 last year when a complainant came across PDF documents with the names and schools of students participating in the 2017 Annual Inter-School Taekwondo Championships, according to the decision published by the Personal Data Protection Commission. The NRIC numbers were not \"immediately visible to the complainant\" in the PDF documents, as they were set out in columns which were minimised, said the decision. However when the complainant copied and pasted the PDF documents' contents to another document, he was able to see the NRIC numbers of the students. He then went on to inform the taekwondo federation of this, but did not receive a response and so lodged a complaint with the Personal Data Protection Commission. HOW IT HAPPENED According to the decision, the federation would first receive an encrypted Excel spreadsheet with the personal data of students intending to participate in the championships from the Ministry of Education. After receiving this, the federation's head of the tournament department would then rearrange the students' data into programme lists and bout sheets using Microsoft Excel. The tournament head said he would \"hide\" the students' NRIC numbers before converting the spreadsheets into PDF documents. \"Thereafter, I will send the new Excel spreadsheet with the names, schools, programme list and hidden NRIC numbers to [redacted] who will then convert it into a PDF list for uploading onto (the federation's) website,\" the decision quoted the tournament head as saying.  \"She also has been doing this since 2015 but she does not know that I simply hide the NRIC numbers.\" In its investigations, officers from the commission copied the PDF documents from the federation's website to a new Microsoft Word document, and found that the columns which were not visible on the PDFs did appear when copied onto the Word document. However when the commission tried to replicate the data disclosure by creating a new spreadsheet and replicating the process, it found that \"hidden\" contents were not revealed when copied to a separate Microsoft Word or Excel document. \"Subsequently, the officers of the commission discovered that this issue would only occur if the columns were minimised instead,\" said the decision. \"Based on the foregoing, the commissioner finds that the columns in the Excel spreadsheet prepared by the tournament head were not hidden but merely minimised.\" FEDERATION \"NOT AWARE\" OF PDPA  The taekwondo federation also admitted that it was not aware of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) and so had not appointed a data protection officer or any policies necessary to meet its obligations. However this lack of awareness was \"not a legitimate defence\", said the decision. In addition, the decision highlighted the fact that the federation's mistake of not realising the NRIC numbers were in minimised columns in the PDFs could be \"quite easily repeated\". \"Any person could simply copy the contents of the PDF documents and paste it onto another document, thereby resulting in further unauthorised disclosures of the students’ personal data,\" said the decision.  \"Such potential impact and harm cannot be ignored, especially when it involves the NRIC numbers of 782 students who were also minors, and whose personal data would thus be considered to be more sensitive in nature.\" FEDERATION CAUSED \"QUITE SOME DELAYS\" TO INVESTIGATION In addition, the federation had also \"caused quite some delays in the investigation process\", said the decision. It only responded to the commission's notice to require production of documents and information after two months and multiple reminders, and only after the federation's president was copied into one of these email reminders. Taking all this into consideration, the federation was fined S$30,000.  It was also directed to appoint a data protection officer within 30 days, to develop and implement policies necessary to meet its PDPA obligations within 30 days, and to inform the commission of the completion of each direction within a week of its implementation.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-taekwondo-federation-fined-minors-nric-pdpa-10515338"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 11:59AM", "tags": ["Mahathir Mohamad", "Malaysia", "High-Speed Rail"], "author": "Sumisha Naidu", "title": "Singapore ‘knows what we want to do’ about High-Speed Rail: Mahathir", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the country has not yet given Singapore \"full notice\" of its intentions for the planned Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) but that its neighbour knew what it wanted to do. \"As far as the Singapore government is concerned, we have not given them full notice yet, but they know what we want to do,\" he said at a news conference on Tuesday (Jul 10).

It will partner regional grocery delivery provider HappyFresh to offer the service via the revamped Grab app, the company said during a media briefing. More than 100,000 grocery products from more than 50 large supermarket chains and speciality grocery chains will be available via HappyFresh, Grab said in the press release. GrabExpress drivers and delivery partners can send the groceries to customers' doorsteps within an hour, or at a pre-arranged time. Customers can reject items that are not satisfactory at the door, it added. GrabFresh jostles into an already busy space, with players like Amazon Prime, RedMart and NTUC FairPrice offering similar services. It will be available as a beta service in Jakarta from this month, and in Thailand and Malaysia by end of this year - all markets HappyFresh are currently in. Other countries like Singapore will follow, Grab added, but it did not reveal a date. ONE APP TO RULE THEM ALL? This latest service is an example of how GrabPlatform, another announcement made on Tuesday, can be used as a bridge for other companies to partner the ride-hailing company. GrabPlatform has a suite of application programming interface (APIs) to allow partners access to its technology in areas like logistics and payments, messaging and user insights, it added. “Southeast Asia is set to be the fourth largest economy by 2050,” CEO Anthony Tan said.  “Combining Grab’s assets with the specialised expertise of our partners will enable both Grab and our partners to grow most efficiently and quickly to serve more Southeast Asian customers daily.” Mr Jerald Singh, head of Product at Grab, said during the same media briefing that the goal is for its app to offer all the daily essentials to its users.  Besides the just-announced GrabFresh service, Mr Singh also said the revamped Grab app will also have a “news feed” feature similar in design to what social media giant Facebook has currently. With this feed, news, reviews, entertainment and games can be pushed to users according to their preference and other factors like public holidays and weather. For instance, the feed will provide the times to break fast during Ramadan or if one should take a car or bicycle during rainy weather, the company said. Companies that want to offer their services on the platform will have to agree to a revenue-sharing arrangement with Grab, Mr Tan said, although he declined to reveal details. He added that the space where these third-party apps reside on the Grab app is like \"Orchard Road prime estate\", so it will be curated. Companies looking to get on board will have to fulfil certain requirements like offering everyday services or content, providing value to users or utilising the company's payments and logistics features, he explained.  Its immediate focus is on companies in logistics, new mobility and fintech, the CEO added. The revamped Grab app for iOS devices will be rolled out in Singapore and Indonesia starting from Tuesday, and on Android devices from Jul 18. Other markets will have access to the updated version by the third quarter of this year, the company said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grabfresh-grocery-delivery-service-grab-10515364"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 10:04AM", "tags": ["marriage", "families"], "author": "", "title": "Divorce rate down, number of marriages up in 2017", "content": " SINGAPORE: The divorce rate in Singapore fell while the number of marriages increased last year, according to figures released by the Department of Statistics (Singstat) on Tuesday (Jul 10). There were a total of 28,212 civil and Muslim marriages registered in 2017, 0.9 per cent higher than the previous year. The general marriage rate for males increased from 44.4 marriages per thousand unmarried males aged 15 to 49 in 2016 to 45.7 in 2017, added Singstat. Similarly for females, the rate rose from 41.6 marriages per thousand unmarried females aged 15 to 49 to 42.8 over the same period. A total of 7,578 marriages ended in a divorce or an annulment in 2017, 0.5 per cent lower than the 7,614 marital dissolutions in the previous year. This was due to the decline in Muslim divorces, which more than offset the slight increase in civil divorces, according to Singstat. The general divorce rate fell to 6.9 male divorcees for every thousand married males aged 20 and over in 2017, lower than the rate of 7.1 in 2016. Similarly, the rate for females fell to 6.5 per thousand married females aged 20 and over in 2017, from 6.6 in the previous year. The median age at divorce rose over the last 10 years. The median ages for male and female divorcees were 43.2 and 39.1 respectively in 2017, up from 39.8 and 36.1 in 2007. The median duration of marriage for divorces similarly rose, to 10.3 years in 2017, up from 9.6 years in 2007. Couples who were married for five to nine years accounted for the largest share (30.2 per cent) of all divorces in 2017. Singstat added that the median age of first-time grooms was relatively stable over the last decade, falling to 30.0 years in 2017 after rising from 29.8 years in 2007 to 30.3 years in 2016. On the other hand, the median age of first-time brides rose from 27.2 years in 2007 to 28.4 years in 2017, thus narrowing the gender age gap. Meanwhile, inter-ethnic marriages continued to increase in 2017 to 22.1 per cent of total marriages, up from 16.4 per cent in 2007. STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Minister for Social and Family Development (MSF) Desmond Lee said his ministry will continue to work to strengthen marriages and provide support for families where marriages have broken down. \"Our Divorce Support Specialist Agencies conduct support programmes and counselling for divorced or divorcing families. For example, parents with children below 21 years of age and are unable to agree on divorce and ancillary matters, are required to undergo the Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP) before they file for divorce,\" he added.  Mr Lee said the MPP \"helps parents understand the impact of their divorce on their children.\" He added: \"We also set up a committee with the Ministry of Law and the Family Justice Courts this year to review and enhance reforms in the family justice system. This review includes studying how we can make the divorce process less adversarial by harnessing the benefits of restorative and therapeutic justice.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/divorce-rate-marriages-singapore-2017-10515312"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Dining", "McDonald's", "National Day"], "author": "Genevieve Sarah Loh", "title": "McDonald’s celebrates National Day with 'Ha Ha Cheong Gai' menu and Breakfast Curry Burger | CNA Lifestyle Exclusive", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: In celebration of Singapore's upcoming national day, fast-food institution McDonald's will once again unveil a limited-time special menu inspired by our local hawker favourites.

Both the burger and drumlets will be soft-launched after breakfast hours on Jul 10 and available at all outlets across Singapore, as well as via McDelivery and GrabFood. Launched in conjunction with the Singapore Food Festival 2018, the Ha Ha Cheong Gai Chicken Burger consists of a whole chicken thigh marinated with real prawn paste and coated with crispy bread crumbs and slathered with prawn paste-flavoured mayonnaise. Prices starts from S$6.05 for the burger and S$2.20 for the two-piece Ha Ha Cheong Gai Chicken Drumlets. Also on this limited-time special menu is the all new Breakfast Curry Burger - a McChicken patty layered with the classic McDonald’s curry sauce, served up with melted cheese and a sunny side-up egg. Prices start from S$4.20 and it’ll be available during breakfast hours via McDelivery, GrabFood and at all outlets except LIDO and Singapore Science Centre. McDonald’s will also be bringing back its popular Kueh Salat Cake at all McCafés, on the heels of the Singapore debut of its D24 Durian McFlurry last week. Last August, McDonald's Singapore launched a similar series of locally inspired items, including the hugely popular Nasi Lemak burger and Chendol McFlurry, which sold out within two weeks. “As Singaporeans, we pride ourselves on many things local and food is definitely one that binds us together as a big family,” said Agatha Yap, Senior Director of Marketing and Digital Innovation at McDonald’s Singapore. “In conjunction with the Singapore Tourism Board's Singapore Food Festival 2018 and the upcoming National Day, we want to fuel Singaporeans’ passion for authentic local flavours with a twist, alongside their love for our core burger classics.” NATIONAL DAY PARADE 2018 | Watch the parade live on channelnewsasia.com starting from 5.30pm on Aug 9.Our livestream is also available on twitter.com/channelnewsasia and facebook.com/channelnewsasia.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/mcdonalds-har-cheong-gai-prawn-paste-burger-breakfast-curry-10485892"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 06:20AM", "tags": ["Singapore property", "ABSD", "En bloc"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Amid property curbs, some en bloc attempts go on while others change tracks", "content": " SINGAPORE: While at least one collective sale bid will be launched as planned this week, others have hit the pause button or are drawing up new plans amid uncertain prospects following the surprise of fresh property cooling measures. An extension in tender closing dates is one way that some marketing agents hope will keep their en bloc sale bids alive. They also told Channel NewsAsia that homeowners’ price expectations, the size and location of sites will become increasingly important factors for collective sale attempts moving forward.  In an unexpected move on Jul 5, the Government announced a string of measures aimed at cooling the local property market and keep price increases “in line with economic fundamentals”. Apart from those aimed at homebuyers, the latest property curbs also include a non-remissible five per cent Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) for developers when they purchase en bloc properties for redevelopment.  Residential developers also face an increase in the remissible ABSD from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, which can only be waived if all the units in the new development are sold within five years of acquiring the site.  These measures, described as “heavy-handed” by some analysts, will dampen the buoyant en bloc market as they raise land acquisition costs for developers and in turn, reduce the bullishness of tender bids. Buying demand will also be hit by the hike in ABSD rates and tightened loan-to-value (LTV) limits, analysts said.  Naturally, those hoping to jump on the en bloc bandwagon have been worried. “Homeowners are definitely very concerned; one of the first comments I heard was ‘It’s game over’,” said Ms Christina Sim, director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield.  COUNTER-MEASURES As such, Ms Sim said her company plans to suggest a one-month extension for the tender closing date for Dalvey Court when it meets with the sales committee. Put up for sale on Jun 25 at S$160 million, the tender for the 32-unit freehold condominium located off Bukit Timah Road is set to end on Aug 2.  Meanwhile, the plan for Waterloo Apartments in the Bugis area to go en bloc this week has been shelved, pending discussions with the sales committee, added Ms Sim. “We were thinking if we should wait for authorities to get back to us on our outline planning permission (OPP) for the site to be zoned for hotel use, or launch it as a residential site as soon as possible,” she said. “I think now, we will most likely wait.”  JLL is also planning to advise the sales committee of Horizon Towers, which was put on the market at a reserve price of S$1.1 billion last week, to lengthen the tender period by about a month to early-September.  “We have to think about what sort of adjustments to take,” said JLL’s regional director of capital markets Tan Hong Boon, who added that Horizon Towers owners are “concerned” about the potential impact of the new cooling measures.  Given that developers would require more time to digest the surprise measures, Mr Tan said: “It is therefore prudent for us to advise the owners to extend the tender closing period to ensure sufficient time is given for the developers’ assessments of the market and the site.”  There are exceptions.  Fortune Park, for one, will be going ahead with its collective sale attempt on Thursday (Jul 12), according to marketing agent Huttons Asia. The project has a S$126 million reserve price.  “We have no plans to hold back the launch or change our tender period,” investment sales head Terence Lian told Channel NewsAsia.  Contrary to other marketing agents, Huttons Asia will also be staying put with the tender periods for Jansen Mansion and Blossom Mansions which are due to end on Aug 2 and Jul 31, respectively.  “While we received a lot of enquiries about how these cooling measures will impact the ongoing collective sales, we are not that worried because we think the measures will not affect small- and medium-sized projects,” said Mr Lian.  Fortune Park is a 68-unit freehold condominium in Kovan; Jansen Mansion and Blossom Mansions are smaller developments with 12 and 20 units, respectively.  He added: “The number of units that a small site can be redeveloped into will be comparatively lesser than a mega site. So even if developers have to pay the additional five per cent ABSD, they may be spared the 25 per cent penalty since they have a higher chance of clearing the units within five years.\"  MARKET TO GRIND TO A HALT? Still, Mr Lian said developers may give big sites a chance if they are in a prime location and reasonably priced. Currently, Huttons Asia is working on two mega sites that are nearing the 80 per cent consent level.  For Kensington Park condominium in Serangoon Gardens, whose owners are eyeing a price of S$1.05 billion, the company has secured 70 per cent. Over at Pine Grove in the Pandan Valley area, it has managed to convince 76 per cent of homeowners.  To allay any concerns, Mr Lian said he and his team will be meeting the sales committees for both condos later this week. “Before the measures, some owners were hoping to increase the reserve prices. With this, we hope they can be realistic and come on board to support us.”  Echoing that, Colliers International’s managing director Tang Wei Leng thinks the latest cooling measures will “likely tame the euphoria among would-be en bloc sellers and help to rein in any unrealistic price expectation”.  \"Typically, owners receive a 50 to 60 per cent premium from selling their property collectively. They may now have to accept a lower premium if they want to get the deal across the line,” she added.  For Cushman & Wakefield, the company might consider a re-launch of United Mansion at a lower reserve price. The previous tender closed on May 9 without concluding a sale as bids received were lower than the reserve price of S$98 million. For the other projects, Ms Sim said she will advise homeowners to avoid jumping the gun. This includes Cavendish Park, Eastern Lagoon, Chuan Park and Shelford Green. Chuan Park – a 446-unit, 99-year leasehold condominium at Lorong Chuan – is the “more challenging” site given its sheer size, according to Ms Sim. Since convening last year, the sales committee has managed to secure 76 per cent consent level. “We’ve got up to October to get 80 per cent and we are going to stretch it till then,” she said.  “I think the key is not to rush and jump the gun because there’s no point launching in the market now. Let the market recover from the shock first and typically, we should see the dust settle in about two to three months’ time.”  But not all market observers are optimistic of a recovery in the near term.  DBS analyst Derek Tan, for instance, believes that the en bloc market could grind to a halt as property developers recalibrate their strategies to clear unsold stock at high prices.  The revised ABSD rates “greatly increases the capital commitment for developers looking to land-bank further in a period of increased uncertainty in buying volumes and heightened supply entering the market in the coming two years”, he wrote in a note.  As such, the immediate strategy for developers with upcoming launches will be to re-look their pricing and launch strategy.  While this is not a base case scenario, “if sell-through rates do not follow through, the risk of potential write-off to land values will be a concern” in the longer term, Mr Tan added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/property-cooling-curbs-absd-en-bloc-attempts-go-on-10512264"}, {"datetime": "10 Jul 2018 06:17AM", "tags": ["defence", "air force", "F16", "F35", "Joint Strike Fighter"], "author": "Mike Yeo", "title": "Commentary: The Republic of Singapore Air Force's likely new fighter jet", "content": " MELBOURNE: Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s revelation that Singapore will soon decide which aircraft will replace the Lockheed-Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-role jet fighter in the Republic of Singapore Air Force service has re-ignited interest in the programme among the wider defence community. Speaking to media in the lead-up to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Day, Dr Ng had said that the decision will be made in the next few months, with the new fighters needed by the 2030s when the F-16s will start facing obsolescence issues. He added that some of the criteria that will be used to choose the new jet will be its capability to defend Singapore’s airspace; whether it can work with other SAF air, land and sea platforms; ease of maintenance; as well as the overall cost. F-35 THE FAVOURITE The fighter jet that is being replaced, the F-16, has been the mainstay of the RSAF since 1998, when the first of what will become 60 aircraft were delivered to the RSAF.  Singapore’s F-16s are currently being progressively upgraded by manufacturer Lockheed-Martin, where they will be fitted with a new, more advanced radar, and improved datalinks for better networking with the rest of the SAF’s assets. Capable as they are, the F-16s will be more than 30 years old by the year 2030 and will be approaching the end of its useful life even with the upgrades.  With this in mind, it had been known as far back as 2013 that the Defence Ministry had been looking at new fighters, with the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter being one of the types evaluated and seen by many as the favourite to be chosen as Singapore’s next fighter jet. As its name suggests, the F-35 is the result of a multinational programme by several nations led by the United States to develop a next generation multirole fighter. These other development partners include the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway. Other users of the F-35 include Israel, Japan and South Korea, all of whom have received their first aircraft. Described as a fifth generation fighter by Lockheed-Martin, the F-35 is more than a traditional fighter jet. In addition to the “stealthy” design and features that will make it difficult for an enemy to detect it with radars and other sensors, also features a host of other advanced capabilities. These include an advanced, secure datalink that will allow F-35s to share information about the battlefield and assist each other in targeting adversaries without the risk of inadvertently revealing their own location. There is also what is called the Distributed Aperture System, essentially six electro-optical cameras that will allow the F-35 pilot to “see” all around the aircraft including what is below and behind the aircraft. The images, as well as other important flight and combat parameters, will be able to be projected onto the visor of the F-35’s unique helmet, allowing the pilot to have improved awareness on what is happening around him compared to today’s contemporaries.  There are three variants of the F-35: The conventional take-off and landing F-35A that has been ordered by the US Air Force and most user nations, the F-35B Short Take-Off Vertical Landing version ordered by the US Marine Corps, the UK and Italy that can take off on shorter runways and smaller aircraft carriers, and the F-35C designed to operate off the full-sized US Navy aircraft carriers. Several quarters have reported that Singapore’s interest is in the F-35B variant.  Given Singapore’s land constraints as well as the small number of airbases available to the RSAF (especially given that Paya Lebar Airbase is set to be relocated in 2030 or later), the choice of a fighter jet that can operate from shorter runways would make sense. It would allow the RSAF to continue generating air power even in the event of its runways being targeted during combat. However, the F-35B, which has a large lift fan in the centre of its fuselage to allow it to land vertically, has some restrictions placed on its manoeuvrability as well as being unable to carry as much in its internal weapons bay as a result compared to the other variants. This opens the possibility that Singapore may opt for a mixed fleet of F-35As and Bs, although this will likely be contingent on how much more it will cost to operate two different variants compared to a homogenous fleet. OTHER CONTENDERS During his media interview, Dr Ng also mentioned several other fighter types available on the market although he appeared to stop short of confirming that Singapore had also evaluated these types. These include the European Eurofighter Typhoon as well as Russian and Chinese stealth fighters. Despite its very impressive performance, the Typhoon is essentially what is known as a “4.5 Generation” fighter which does not offer significant improvements in capability over the RSAF’s F-15SG and upgraded F-16 fighters. Meanwhile, Russian and Chinese offerings would present significant inter-operability issues with the rest of the SAF’s equipment, which are almost exclusively of western origin. The RSAF has always operated US-made fighter aircraft with the exception of its first combat aircraft, the British Hawker Hunter acquired in the 1970s. There are also question marks over the development and capabilities of Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57, with India pulling out of a planned joint development of the type while China is unlikely to export its Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter.  Chinese designs are also further hampered by the use of Russian engines, with Chinese attempts at developing indigenous jet engines hampered by lingering engineering issues. A CONSIDERED APPROACH​​​​​​​ Singapore’s interest in the F-35 was known as far back as 2013 with Dr Ng saying then that the F-35 was “a suitable aircraft to further modernise our fighter fleet”. However, that has not been translated into an F-35 order from Singapore, with the Defence Minister saying in the meantime that Singapore was in “no particular hurry” to do so with the F-16s expected to serve until the 2030s. It is possible that in this time, Singapore has been negotiating to ensure that it would be able to maintain as high a level of sovereign capability as possible for its aircraft in the form of customising them for Singapore’s unique requirements like it has done with RSAF’s F-15s and F-16s.  It is also likely that Singapore would have wanted to keep heavy maintenance of its aircraft in-country instead of sending its aircraft to a Lockheed-established regional facility, as well as requested restrictions on what sort of operational data is sent to the cloud-based logistics system designed and operated by the aircraft manufacturer. The gap in time between Singapore’s initial interest and impending decision is also likely as a result of the Defence Ministry waiting on the F-35 development programme’s maturity before committing to the type. Due in no small part to the F-35’s cutting edge technology but also because of programme management missteps, the development of the F-35 has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. It is only now that the schedule is mostly getting back on track with the flight test programme in its advanced stages and production starting to ramp up. As such, an order in the near future means the SAF can be reasonably confident of getting a fully combat-capable aircraft, while at the same time there will be less risk of the aircraft being ordered too late and not being able to be delivered to meet the F-16 retirement dates. The United States has also started to deploy its own F-35s, with the Marines now operating a squadron of F-35Bs to Japan since 2017 and on board its amphibious ships earlier this year. F-35 pilots who have taken part in the realistic Red Flag wargames in the Nevada desert have also been effusive with their praise of the “God’s eye view” of the battlefield offered by the F-35’s sensors, calling it a “game-changer” in the realm of air combat. Other partner countries are also starting to receive their aircraft and based on development timelines, receiving aircraft in the 2030s would mean the Singapore will be getting fully mature aircraft with a full set of capabilities. With the production of what is expected to be an order book of 3,000 aircraft well underway, it would also mean that aircraft unit price and operating costs would have dropped by then, with Lockheed-Martin targeting the price of a single F-35A to be US$80 million, or cheaper than the cost of some of today’s fighters.

New regime promising, but requires some pain", "content": " SINGAPORE: For the past months, bicycle-sharing operators have been ramping up preparations to meet new licensing requirements, leaving no stone unturned as they beefed up their geo-tracking software and deployed teams to prowl the streets, among other things. The licensing scheme, which started on Saturday (Jul 7), comes with strict conditions on fleet size and responsible parking by users. Applications have closed and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is studying the operators’ submissions. Two-year licences are expected to be awarded by the fourth quarter of the year. Operators and analysts say the scheme will likely shrink the pool of users and hit the firms’ profitability, given the greater compliance costs among other things. While the financial hit will be painful, operators acknowledge that the regulations will improve the state of affairs. Ultimately, the new rules will result in a much better space, in contrast to the mess today, firms and analysts say. But getting there will be painstaking. Behind closed doors, much negotiation and bargaining are taking place. Testifying to the onerous nature of the new regime, it has already claimed three casualties even before it is in full swing — with oBike being the highest profile among them. oBike, along with GBikes and ShareBikeSG, called it quits with two of the firms citing difficulties meeting the licensing requirements. At least four operators — China-based ofo and Mobike, as well as home-grown firms SG Bike and Anywheel — have submitted their applications. But as observers pointed out, it is anyone’s guess how many will remain in business going forward. The coming months could make or break the nascent bicycle-sharing industry, which many see as having a pivotal role in achieving Singapore’s car-lite vision. As the licensing scheme kicks in, bicycle-sharing operators tells us their preparations and the challenges they face, and share what users can expect in the new landscape. KEEPING UP WITH THE RULES In March, Parliament passed new laws requiring operators offering dockless shared bicycles, personal mobility devices and power-assisted bikes to be regulated under a new licensing regime. Under the licensing requirements, operators have to ensure cyclists practise responsible parking. This includes requiring them to scan a unique quick-response (QR) code at designated parking spots as proof of proper parking before they can end their trip. Users who park indiscriminately could be fined by operators or charged continuously until they return the bicycles to a parking space. Those who flout the rules thrice yearly will be barred from all bicycle-sharing services for up to a year. In seeking to meet the requirements, operators said that they face several challenges amid a constant back-and-forth with the authorities. For example, the LTA had earlier required the operators to provide the exact location of all their bicycles in 30-minute intervals. But this would translate into high costs for the operators. In the end, a compromise was reached: ofo, for example, will provide data that reflects changes only for bicycles that have moved. Other issues which remain up in the air include the penalty for indiscriminate parking. Some operators are also putting a lid on the number of bicycles in circulation — holding back parts of their fleet — to keep the problem of indiscriminate parking from spiralling out of control. While the nuts and bolts are still being ironed out, one thing is clear: Operators have to pour in funds, to the tune of millions for some, to comply with the licensing rules. The higher business costs will place a drag on bottomlines, especially for smaller operators devoid of deep pockets, in a sector that already yields low margins and little in the way of profits. The regime, for instance, requires operators to fork out a S$60 fee for every bicycle deployed, comprising a licensing fee and a security deposit. SG Bike, one of the smallest players here with 1,500 bicycles, said the fee was “painful” from a business point of view, though it was necessary to set operators thinking about how their bikes can be maintained and utilised better. “Now there’s a price tag on the bike … it forces you to rethink your strategy,” its chief operating officer Sean Tay said. Even the bigger boys are not spared. ofo, which runs a 75,000-strong fleet, cited the S$60 fee as an area in which the regime has gone “a little bit too far”, saying it makes it tougher to turn a profit. Mr Christopher Hilton, ofo’s head of policy and communications for South-east Asia, said the firm was concerned that a “Government … committed to a car-lite society is making an environmentally friendly and efficient mode of transport more expensive”. It will be more difficult to keep rides affordable, he added, though the operator is not looking to raise its fees for the moment. The bicycle-sharing firms said the biggest improvements to be made were in their back-end software, to link their systems to the LTA’s network of QR codes that will sprawl across parking spaces islandwide. They will also be required to carry out a second layer of checks — via Global Positioning System coordinates — to verify that users are, indeed, at or near a parking spot with a QR code. Operators also have to share data with one another so that errant users can be banned. How and where such data will be hosted are still unclear, sparking concern in the industry that firms could gain access to one another’s customers. Some firms said they would also have to enlarge their teams to meet the stricter rules. For instance, Anywheel, which has 4,000 bicycles, said it has added four operations staff members and another four to its information-technology team. DETERMINING THE PENALTIES  As the authorities sift through the licence applications, exactly how users will be penalised for indiscriminate parking remains up in the air, operators said. While operators are required under the licensing framework to charge users continuously for bicycles parked outside the designated areas, ofo pointed out that many of its customers are on monthly subscription passes and \"there is no ability\" to charge them a continuous fee. Instead, errant users will face a S$10 fine from the firm, said ofo’s Mr Hilton. The fine will be imposed on users who park on public land “at an area other than one with a QR code”. At the start of the regime, the LTA has suggested putting in place a “wide” radius around parking spots, so as to allow a broader berth in determining if bikes are parked properly, Mr Hilton said. This is to ensure that those who make an effort to park properly are not fined. SG Bike’s marketing director Benjamin Oh said its users will face a continuous charge if they park indiscriminately or if the location of a bike does not tally with the parking spot where the QR code was scanned. Users will be given an unspecified “grace period” before they are levied the penalty. Some operators were concerned that the penalties could drive users from bicycle-sharing services, stressing that the convenience of parking areas was key. Users may find it challenging if the parking spots are very far apart, said Mr Oh. He added: At this point, unfortunately, we have no idea where (the parking spots) are, so we have to wait for the LTA’s cue. As of March, there were 174,000 designated bicycle-parking spots in spaces such as MRT stations, parks and housing estates. The Government plans to add another 50,000 by 2020. Other factors include how much leeway the system will give users who forget or are unaware of the rules. Calling it a “big shift”, Mr Oh said much needs to be done to educate users who are “so used to just parking and leaving” on the extra steps they have to take. Echoing the concerns, Mr Hilton said a S$10 fine was a “serious impediment” to ofo’s users who pay about S$6 for a 30-day pass, for instance. “We are concerned it will drive users away.” The authorities have not given operators significant direction on how the penalties should be meted out, said Mr Hilton, who stressed that equal enforcement was key among firms. If we’re being stringent in trying to follow the rules and another operator isn’t, then consumers might move to one of our competitors. Still, Mobike’s head of international operations Mark Lin said the penalties are to “everyone’s advantage”. The collective ban will ensure users take greater responsibility when using shared bikes. “The requirements made by the Singapore Government are actually quite reasonable and conducive to building a responsible sharing community … so whoever is not responsible should not stay in this community,” he said. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE, AND OTHER CONCERNS   For a majority of the operators, the higher business costs involved were uppermost on their minds. As part of the new licensing regime, the LTA requires operators to provide data on the locations of their bicycles islandwide in 30-minute intervals, for instance. Presently, ofo churns this data every three hours via its bicycles’ smart locks. The firm is concerned that business could be hit as more frequent snapshots would mean the three-year lifespan of its bikes’ batteries could be shortened significantly. This, in turn, means more frequent battery changes, said Mr Hilton. So, it found common ground with the LTA. Instead of feeding real-time data from each bicycle in its fleet, it would reflect changes only for bicycles that have moved every 30 minutes. This allows ofo to maintain its plans for its technology, added Mr Hilton. For the firms, the changes in the pipeline are largely in software and user experience to comply with the rules. ofo, for instance, is adding an option for manual verification should a QR code be broken, such as allowing users to take a photo of where a bike has been parked. The Chinese firm, which applied to run an 80,000-strong fleet, said that the S$60 licensing fee per bicycle alone will set it back by S$4.8 million. The fee, which comes on top of engineering and manpower costs, “pushes out our ability to capitalise and become profitable”, Mr Hilton said. Anywheel, which applied for a licence to run a fleet of 30,000 bicycles, said the fee was “still reasonable”, as the firm expected it to be higher. Its chief executive Htay Aung acknowledged, however, that no other market would levy such a fee, which will hit operators with larger proposed fleets harder. Still, SG Bike’s Mr Tay said that the fee will force operators to ensure their bicycles do not sit idle on the streets. He added: Singapore will benefit in the long run from not having random bikes … left out there. There is also the concern that firms could tap into one another’s customer data for commercial benefit, as they exchange information on errant users. Mr Hilton said his company has suggested that the LTA host the database, but this would mean costs incurred by the Government. It would be ideal if only data on users who park indiscriminately or are banned is shared among operators, he said. Mobike’s Mr Lin said his firm was confident that the LTA would be able to protect user privacy, and that it would have given thought to how user information would be exchanged. The LTA did not respond to queries on the operators’ concerns over costs, the measures that will be in place to protect user data, and how the penalties will be meted out to commuters. While industry players and experts had previously said the fallout from oBike’s exit would not have a direct impact on the industry — apart from denting public confidence — transport economist Walter Theseira of the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) reiterated that it could deter users from committing deposits and other forms of pre-payment.  It may also hit confidence in storing payment methods with the bicycle-sharing mobile applications, Dr Theseira added. Experts pointed out that by not collecting deposits, firms lose a means to finance the business and secure payment for damages and penalties from errant users. Associate Professor Lawrence Loh of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School said operators are in a “catch-22 situation — damned if you do, damned if you don’t”. “If you impose deposits, you lose customers. If you don’t, you get to deal with errant customers,” said Assoc Prof Loh, who is director of the school’s Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations. oBike’s departure from the Singapore market on June 25 caught scores of users off-guard. Many are scrambling to recover the deposits — up to S$49 — that they placed with the firm, which is in liquidation. Just four days after oBike’s exit, Mobike announced it was scrapping the S$49 deposit for Singapore users — it later did away with deposits for its China users as well. Mr Lin, Mobike’s international operations head, said the decision was not linked to oBike’s exit. The firm had been mulling over removing the requirement for some time as it felt its users were now “quite responsible” and there was no need for a deposit, which was meant to deter irresponsible behaviour. Mobike’s move means all bicycle-sharing operators here offer deposit-free services presently. Mr Lin said doing away with customer deposits was not a concern for his firm, which has a “healthy business model”. “The deposit-free policy was a move designed to establish a no-threshold, zero-burden and zero-condition deposit-free standard for the bike-sharing sector in Singapore,” he said. Under the new licensing regime, operators will have to collect users’ details, including their National Registration Identification Card numbers and full names. Mr Aung said firms can send recalcitrant users letters and messages to request payment for penalties. As for Mobike, Mr Lin said errant commuters will not be able to use its bikes if their balance dips into the red, until they fork out the fines. HOW THE NEW BIKE-SHARING LANDSCAPE COULD LOOK  Going forward, most operators are confident the licensing scheme would create a more conducive environment for firms and users. Mobike’s Mr Lin said the regime would encourage a responsible sharing community and hold operators accountable for the bicycles they deploy. Agreeing, Mr Hilton said a regulated space will allow operators and users to understand their responsibilities, ensuring bicycle-sharing can be sustainable in Singapore. Still, Mr Tay from SG Bike believes it would be “very, very hard” to change user behaviour initially. In the longer term, the success of the rules will hinge on the effort invested by users, firms and the authorities, he said. “The LTA needs to also actively take a lead on this. If they just come up with a licence, (but say the operators) go and run it (and we’ll just) poke you from the back, then perhaps instead of it being conducive, everything will just collapse,” he said. “But if that can be solved, then I think in the long run, this will be great (for Singapore).” Dr Theseira believes the new rules will likely make bicycle-sharing less convenient, driving away users who perceive the designated parking spots to be inconvenient. He also expects the pool of users to shrink over time owing to concerns over payment. Mr Lin disagreed, saying that the pool could in fact grow as the bicycle-sharing community becomes more responsible and sheds its association with public misuse. NEXT ‘6 TO 12 MONTHS’ CRUCIAL  As the industry braces for the stricter rules on the horizon, some observers have questioned the commercial viability of the dockless bicycle-sharing business. Urban transport analyst Park Byung-joon, who is also with the SUSS, said the next six to 12 months will be keenly watched, as the global bike-sharing market confronts challenges. Given the low fees collected and high maintenance expenses, companies cannot turn huge profits and thus need to grab a large market share to sustain their business. Consequently, the market can support only “one or two” players, added Assoc Prof Park. If dockless bicycle-sharing is found to be financially unsustainable, Assoc Prof Park and Dr Theseira believe the industry will move towards a government-supported docked bicycle-sharing model, which has flourished in some European cities. Last year, the LTA shelved plans to start a docked bicycle-sharing scheme with about 2,300 bicycles, after private firms began offering dockless services in the same year. The plan was to launch the service last year covering areas such as the Jurong Lake District, Tampines and Marina Bay — about 230 docking stations had been planned. But the entrance of the private players had obviated the need for a government-run system, the LTA had explained. Assoc Prof Park said: “With the docked system, we have more control over places and numbers, and also we know exactly how to get back to the person who caused a problem.” For the time being, however, dockless bicycle-sharing operators are seeking other ways to cash in. ofo is exploring the possibility of diversifying its products to include other equipment such as electric scooters and electric bicycles, although the company declined to give more details. Anywheel is also looking at adding power-assisted bicycles and e-scooters to its fleet. In the longer run, it could even start a private-hire car-hailing service similar to Grab’s when it has a sufficiently large customer base, said Mr Aung. Some firms also intend to make their prices more competitive. Anywheel will roll out a monthly subscription programme next year with “competitive prices” for unlimited rides. SG Bike will also roll out a similar programme soon, said Mr Tay. Ultimately, observers and firms believe the new regime would benefit all. “In the long term, an orderly bike-sharing scene is in the interests of all, including the operators,” said Assoc Prof Loh.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/errantly-parked-bikes-new-regime-promising-but-painful-10511798"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 10:46PM", "tags": [], "author": "", "title": "Workers' Party takes down 'misleading' video which implied PUB had S$5.3b surplus", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Workers’ Party (WP) has taken down an online video which it said had given the impression that national water agency PUB holds a S$5.3 billion surplus, after Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on Monday (Jun 9) that the video was misleading. On Jun 4, WP had put up a video on the rising cost of living in Singapore. The video had text which stated that PUB’s capital reserve \"increased from $3b in 2007 to more than $5b in 2016\", WP secretary-general Pritam Singh said in a Facebook post on Monday. “The video and the text create the impression that the PUB hosts a $5.3b surplus.

Replying to a parliamentary question filed by MP for Holland-Bukit Timah Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Wong had explained in Parliament on Monday that the capital reserve in PUB’s account does not represent surplus funds it has at its disposal.  Instead, the capital reserve is money that is already invested in the water agency’s property, plant and equipment. Mr Wong noted that WP's video had questioned why the water price increases were necessary when PUB's capital reserve had gone up from S$3 billion to S$5.3 billion over the last decade.  He said that the party interpreted the capital reserve as a hoard of cash surplus that the Government is keeping in PUB's account.

In a surprise announcement on Jul 5, the Government raised Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates and tightened loan-to-value (LTV) limits on residential property purchases, in an effort to \"cool the property market and keep price increases in line with economic fundamentals\".  The move came several days after official data showed that private home prices had jumped by 9.1 per cent year-on-year in the April-to-June period, with analysts predicting that prices could soon recover to 2013 peak levels.  Some analysts have called the measures - which include a 5-percentage-point increase in stamp duties for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying second and subsequent homes, as well as 5-percentage-point reduction in borrowing for loans from financial institutions - \"heavy-handed\" and \"draconian\", given that the property market \"is in the early stages of a recovery\".  The new measures do not affect stamp duties for first-time buyers who are Singaporeans or permanent residents, nor loans from HDB.  Experts that Channel NewsAsia spoke to said that although the HDB market could see some additional interest from buyers who now find it more difficult financially to purchase a private property, the demand is unlikely to be substantial enough to have much on an impact on the public housing market. \"In terms of real numbers, I would guess it would be several hundred (units) a year,\" said Mr Ku Swee Yong, CEO of International Property Advisor. \"It is only beneficial to people who probably wanted to upgrade from HDB to a private property, but given the new measures and the more negative outlook, they decide to upgrade to HDB instead,\" he said. \"There is some incremental (increase) but it is not solid enough to push resale prices up,\" he added. Resale prices for flats inched up 0.1 per cent in the March-to-June period compared to the previous quarter, with the Resale Price Index (RPI) coming in at 131.7, according to HDB's flash estimates earlier this month. That was the first increase in six quarters. Compared with the same quarter last year, however, resale prices for flats are still down 1.5 per cent. Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of ZACD Group, said that regardless of the cooling measures, most first-time home buyers generally buy HDB flats - be it resale or Build-To-Order (BTO) - for affordability reasons. As such, he believes the HDB resale market is likely to remain at \"status quo\". \"In the first place, they are already going to buy an HDB, so the cooling measures have no impact. It is those living in HDB flats and thinking of buying a condominium, these people will be affected,\" Mr Mak noted. \"There will be some turning from private to resale properties, but this number is so little that it's not going to make a difference.\" Mr Chris Koh, director of property firm Chris Koh International, added: \"On the ground, we're not seeing any impact on the HDB market ... The HDB market is quite distinct from the private sector. People who sell a HDB flat usually buy another one, without looking at private property.\" He added: \"I don't see an influx in terms of many taking advantage of this.\" Going forward, some analysts said, pricing is likely to weigh on buyers' minds. \"Historically, the second and third quarter are good quarters,\" said Mr Koh. \"So if the second quarter can register good stablisation, it will attract buyers to come back into the market.

The Deposit Insurance and Policy Owners' Protection Schemes (Amendment) Bill 2018, which provides a basic level of protection to small depositors, will insure up to S$75,000, up from the current S$50,000. “While there is no international standard on the level of coverage, our objective is to ensure that a vast majority of depositors should be fully covered,” said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, who is also a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Board member.  He was speaking during the Second Reading of the Bill, on behalf of Minister-in-charge of MAS Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Mr Ong said that a survey by the International Association of Deposit Insurers found that the international norm is to fully cover about 90 per cent of all insured depositors. When MAS raised the limit to S$50,000 in 2011, it fully covered over 90 per cent of insured depositors, he said. However, since then, incomes have grown and savings have also increased, meaning that S$50,000 fully covers about 87 per cent of insured depositors today, he added. “Increasing the limit to S$75,000 will restore the percentage of fully insured depositors to above 90 per cent, ensuring that the Deposit Insurance Scheme continues to serve its objective,” he said.  To support the higher coverage limit of S$75,000, the annual premium contributions to the Deposit Insurance Fund - which supports the Deposit Insurance scheme - will be raised by up to 1 basis point per scheme member. POLICY OWNERS’ PROTECTION SCHEME The Policy Owners’ Protection Scheme was set up in 2011 to cover commonly purchased insurance policies. The scheme provides compensation for life, accident and health, and also motor, personal property and travel insurances, in the event that the insurer fails. The Bill will introduce a definition for “personal” insurance policies which will effectively extend protection to claims on damage to properties owned and used by individuals, even if these properties are sometimes used for commercial purposes. “This change addresses a potential protection gap today, given that more individuals are using their personal properties for commercial purposes, such as using their cars to provide private-hire transport services,” Mr Ong said. The Bill will also give MAS the flexibility to prescribe caps on compensation payouts for specific classes or types of policy or claim event insured under the scheme. Currently, the fund could potentially be exposed to very large claims, which could translate into higher premium rates for all consumers, Mr Ong said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/insurance-protection-for-more-small-depositors-private-hire-10513536"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 07:46PM", "tags": ["Consumer", "Parliament", "Small Claims Tribunal"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Parliament: Small Claims Tribunals to hear cases with higher claim quantum, longer time limit", "content": " SINGAPORE: Small Claims Tribunals (SCTs), which hear small claims between consumers and suppliers, has been strengthened to support more cases through amendments to legislation which Parliament passed on Monday (July 9). Among the changes are raising the default limit of claims from S$10,000 to S$20,000. In situations where both parties have agreed, the claim limit can be raised from S$20,000 to S$30,000. The same limit is applied to group claims or class action cases to prevent high-stake cases for respondents. The higher limits are similar to those in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, and reflects inflation and the rising costs of living over the years, said the Ministry of Law (MinLaw). Senior Minister of Law Edwin Tong said that currently, about 9,000 cases filed at State Courts are claims of between the current limit of S$10,000 and the new limit of S$30,000. \"But bear in mind that this range includes, from S$20,000 to S$30,000, cases which can only be brought to the SCT with consent. There are also, on top of that, subject matter limitations in terms of the kinds of cases that can be brought [to the SCT]. So we don't expect the 9,000 to surface in the SCT. There will be a portion of those and certainly that is the reason for this amendment - to drive more claims to the SCT as far as possible,\" said Mr Tong. MP for Tampines GRC Desmond Choo said the increment is particularly helpful for freelancers or those in the gig economy who rely on the SCT as a main recourse to pursue unpaid services or address disputes. \"This is especially so as the monetary value of their services increase over time. I also suggest that MinLaw work with the tripartite partners to develop industry-specific claims mechanisms to help our freelancers.  While the claims process has been simplified over the years, the process can be intimidating for many freelancers,\" Mr Choo added.  The time limit of filing an SCT claim has also been raised from a year to two years to give parties more time to negotiate and settle their disputes, and ensure they have sufficient time to file a claim. HIRE-PURCHASE CLAIMS INCLUDED Claims involving hire-purchase agreements such as motor vehicle sale contracts will be covered under the SCT. MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Joan Pereira said that the inclusion of disputes involving hire-purchase, which have been a popular mode of transactions, is good. “Concerned family members have shared with me about how their elderly family members would get pressured into buying things. This particularly applies to hire-purchase items whereby they were usually misled by the low upfront costs, only to regret when they realise later that the full payable amount is in fact much higher,” Ms Pereira said. With the extension of the limitation period of disputes, those consumers who are bound by a hire-purchase agreement, which typically runs beyond a year, will be able to tap on the SCT for disputes, she said. MP for Jurong GRC Rahayu Mahzam and MP for Mountbatten SMC Lim Biow Chuan asked if MinLaw would consider including more claims types such as written personal loans, injury and property damage claims, and rental deposits in the future. “Recently, when oBike announced that they are ceasing to operate in Singapore, many consumers wanted to submit their claims to SCT to ask for the refund of the rental deposits. However, Section 5 of the SCT Act does not provide for claims for refund of rental deposits. May I urge the Ministry to consider reviewing all common consumer claims and to expand the jurisdiction of the SCT to cover more common consumer disputes?,” Mr Lim said. Mr Tong said that MinLaw will study and continue to review these new forms of transactions arising from new consumer behavior at a later stage. \"These claims for unreturned deposits ... do cause a degree of angst but they are also new types of claims ... and so whilst the claims do exists and they do need to be resolved, I think it'll be necessary to study them and the ecosystem in which they occur to determine the extent to which they are suitable for resolution by the SCT,\" he said. JUDGE TO PRESIDE OVER CLAIMS The Tribunal will adopt a judge-led approach, so that they can guide the parties to adduce the relevant evidence before the tribunal. “This will help to focus the attention of parties on key issues, and lead to cost and time savings for all,” Mr Tong said.  Tribunal magistrates will also be given powers and discretion to dismiss claims, and impose costs in certain situations. MP for West Coast GRC Patrick Tay said that the SCT offers a user-friendly and community-oriented approach to claims between parties, and this must continue through its informal nature. “Care must be taken to reduce the use of jargon and legalese and maintain the use of simplified procedures so that laypersons are not intimidated when presenting their cases at the SCTs,” Mr Tay said Non-Constituency MP Dennis Tan said that claimants and respondents are handle their own claims and deal directly with tribunal magistrates without lawyers. Hence it is important that that “SCT and its staff and migrates will always be motivated to balance the imperative of efficiency with justice and public service”.

The revenue generated, he added, will be retained by the schools. The minister said this in a written response to a Parliamentary question filed by Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera. Mr Perera had asked about the estimated annual revenue derived from the imposition of parking fees for teachers in schools. The Education Ministry confirmed in March that teachers will have to pay monthly season parking rates to park their cars or motorcycles at schools from August. During the school term, the monthly season parking rate for cars is S$75 for an uncovered lot and S$100 for a sheltered lot. During the school holidays, the rate is lowered to S$15 and S$20 for an uncovered lot and sheltered lot, respectively. The annual rate for parking in an uncovered lot is S$720 while that for a sheltered lot is S$960. For motorcycles, the monthly season parking rate during the school term is S$13 for an uncovered lot and S$14 for a sheltered lot. During the school holidays, the rates for uncovered and sheltered lots are S$2 and S$3 respectively. For the full year, it costs S$123 for uncovered lots and S$135 for sheltered lots.  MOE had first said in 2016 that it was reviewing the car park policy for schools, after the Audit-General's Office (AGO) 2014/2015 Financial Year report noted that the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic did not impose charges or had charges that were below the market rate. \"Such practices are tantamount to providing hidden subsidies for vehicle parking and are not in line with the requirements laid down in the Government Instruction Manuals,\" the AGO had said. MOE said that since then, it has been working with the Public Service Division and Ministry of Finance \"to determine an appropriate treatment for staff parking in schools\".  Over the past few months, several MPs have spoken up about the issue. In a Facebook post, the Workers’ Party’s Pritam Singh had said that he is against charging teachers for parking fees. \"Some public sector professions and services - and I count teachers among them - must always be seen in an elected government's eye through a lens that recognises their direct and indirect contributions to nation-building,\" he said.   Meanwhile, in a speech made during the debate on the President’s Address in May, MP for Marine Parade GRC Seah Kian Peng said that the decision was an \"insult\" to teachers who have forked out their own money and time for their students' benefit.  \"Not all government policy has a complete recourse to dollars and cents. We need within our current structures to make more room for the lexicon of morality, duty, relationships and trust,\" he said in the speech, which has been shared widely online. This prompted Mr Ong to make a Facebook post a few days later, where he said that charging parking fees at schools is about upholding the value of self-discipline. \"We have to respect our internal system of checks and balances,” he said in the post. “We cannot pick and choose which finding to address or comply with – we take them all seriously. This is about upholding the value of self-discipline.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teachers-school-parking-fee-8m-10m-a-year-ong-ye-kung-10513312"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 06:13PM", "tags": ["fire", "Pulau Busing"], "author": "", "title": "Lightning strike cause of Pulau Busing oil storage tank fire: Shanmugam on preliminary findings", "content": " SINGAPORE: Preliminary investigations show that a lightning strike was the cause of the oil storage tank fire on Pulau Busing in March, which took firefighters six hours to extinguish.

She was kind and gentle to all those she met, and showed deep care and concern for others, especially those less privileged in life.\" Mr Lee added: \"She had a genuine love for people, and contributed to the prestige and respectability of the Presidency.\" In his letter, Mr Lee recalled meeting Mrs Wee for the first time in 1976, when Dr Wee was Singapore's High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur.  \"Your parents hosted us all to a magnificent Peranakan lunch at their home, making a happy occasion all the more memorable,\" Mr Lee wrote. \"I am sure she oversaw the preparations herself. It was a skill she put to good use, to entertain graciously and put friends and guests at ease.\" Mr Lee also said that he \"deeply appreciated\" Mrs Wee's effort in showing up at his parents' wakes, even though she suffered from arthritis and needed a wheelchair to get around. \"Our thoughts are with you and your family during this time of sorrow,\" said Mr Lee.  In a Facebook post later on Monday evening, Mr Lee said he was deeply saddened to learn of Mrs Wee's passing. \"She lived a long life full of meaning, warmth and generosity,\" Mr Lee said. \"My deepest condolences to Mrs Wee’s children on the loss of their remarkable mother.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mrs-wee-kim-wee-pm-lee-tribute-to-late-presidents-wife-10512990"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 05:50PM", "tags": ["crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Irish man jailed for kicking, trying to headbutt police officers during Clarke Quay arrest", "content": " SINGAPORE: An Irish man who was involved in a drunken scuffle in Clarke Quay has been jailed four weeks and fined S$3,000 after he assaulted and shouted vulgarities at police officers. Colm Patrick Doherty, 27, was in Singapore on a social visit pass on May 4 this year. He met two friends for drinks at Clarke Quay that night and had several pints of beer, court documents said. At about 3.10am on May 5, Doherty got into a scuffle with one of his friends. He also removed his singlet during the scuffle. Doherty's behaviour drew the attention of a crowd of onlookers. About 10 minutes later, police officers arrived at the scene. Court documents said that Doherty was \"reeking of alcohol\" and \"standing unsteadily\". When Doherty told the officers that he did not have any identification on him, they decided to arrest him. At this point, Assistant Superintendent of Police Loh Lianhan - along with his partners Sergeant Jeremy Ng Jit Chen and Sergeant Ng Hwee Ye - arrived at the scene to provide assistance. Court documents show Doherty put up a struggle while being handcuffed. While being escorted to the police car, he also shouted a string of vulgarities at ASP Loh, including: \"Get your hand off me, you stupid ****!\"  Sgt Jeremy sat in the back of the police car with Doherty, who continued shouting. Doherty challenged Sgt Jeremy to a fight and tried to headbutt the police officer. ASP Loh, who was in the driver's seat, was about to begin driving when Doherty extended his right leg through the gap between the seats in front and kicked ASP Loh's left shoulder. Sgt Jeremy shouted at Doherty and held on to him for the rest of the journey to the police station. ASP Loh was not injured. On Monday (Jul 9), District Judge Ng Peng Hong sentenced Doherty to four weeks' jail and a fine of S$3,000. For using a criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty, he could have been jailed for up to four years and fined.

In his written reply to a parliamentary question by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Dennis Tan, Mr Khaw said besides terminating the contract, LTA will also recover the appropriate costs from the construction company. He added that the agency will engage a new contractor to complete the construction of the viaduct from Tampines Expressway (TPE) towards PIE (Tuas) and Upper Changi Road East, as well as the rectification of any structures which are deemed unsafe by the independent Professional Engineer. \"The project timeline and completion date will be reviewed, after the award of the new contract,\" Mr Khaw said. The project was scheduled for completion in 2020. In a separate press release on the same day, LTA said it will call for a replacement tender later this month, and plans to award the contract by the fourth quarter of this year.

The incomplete viaduct collapsed on Jul 14 last year, causing the death of Chinese national Chen Yinchuan who was one of 11 workers on top of the structure before the incident. Another three Chinese, one Indian and six Bangladeshi workers were injured too.  A multi-agency probe into the collapse found that corbels - brackets that help support beams - had given way.

As he gave the House details on the assistance Singapore has given to the Malaysian government on the investigations, Dr Balakrishnan stressed the importance of reaffirming and protecting Singapore’s reputation as a clean, transparent and trusted international financial centre. “We do not tolerate the misuse of our financial system either as a refuge or conduit for illicit funds,” he said.  “We will continue to assist the Malaysian government in its own investigations. We have also informed the Malaysian government that it can avail itself of due legal processes through our courts to establish ownership and recover any assets seized in Singapore that can be traced to 1MDB.” Billions of dollars allegedly went missing from the Malaysian state investment fund, which was launched by former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak in 2009. Mr Najib was charged in court on Jul 4 in a probe related to the misappropriation of funds from the fund.  While Malaysia’s investigations into 1MDB intensified after Pakatan Harapan took over the government, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that Singapore has been conducting probes into offences committed here since 2015. Singapore has shut down two banks and levied fines on others for regulatory breaches, while convicted individuals have also been jailed and fined. “So far, we are the only jurisdiction in the world to have done so,” Dr Balakrishnan said.  He added that Singapore has \"responded fully to every single request for information\" from Malaysian authorities between March 2015 and August 2016. Singapore has also proactively provided additional information on 1MDB-related fund flows to the Malaysian authorities on multiple occasions. In total, Singapore has provided 1MDB-related information in more than 30 exchanges during the period, he said.   “Since the change of government in Malaysia, over the past couple of months, Singaporean and Malaysian agencies have met on several occasions on 1MDB matters,” he said. “In fact, the Malaysian authorities have expressed their appreciation to Singapore for our cooperation.” THREE BILATERAL ISSUES BROUGHT UP BY DR BALAKRISHNAN The 1MDB scandal was one of three bilateral issues the minister brought up in Parliament, in response to a question from MP Christopher de Souza on the state of bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia. On the 1962 Water Agreement, Dr Balakrishnan reiterated Singapore’s “clear and consistent position” on the issue. He stressed that Singapore would fully honour the terms of the agreement, including the price of water stipulated, and expects Malaysia to also do so. The minister also spoke briefly about developments on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project, following statements made by Malaysian leaders over the past two months that suggest Malaysia no longer intends to continue with the project.  However, Dr Balakrishnan said the crux of the issue is the sanctity of international law and agreements. He said he was “heartened” to note comments made by Malaysian finance minister Lim Guan Eng on another project his ministry had undertaken with a foreign commercial party. According to Dr Balakrishnan, Mr Lim had said that should the foreign party not adhere to the terms of the agreement within specified periods, his ministry would be entitled to take certain actions. “To quote Mr Lim: ‘I think we should look at the agreement. We are bound by the agreement,” he said. “So the point is, Mr Lim Guan Eng himself recognises the importance of maintaining the sanctity of agreements.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/1mdb-scandal-singapore-interest-vivian-balakrishnan-parliament-10512388"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 03:39PM", "tags": [], "author": "Gwyneth Teo", "title": "Gateless gantries, suspended trams among public transport innovations on show at World Cities Summit", "content": " SINGAPORE: Innovative technologies may be the key to making public transport more efficient.  That is at the heart of the 3rd Singapore International Transport Congress & Exhibition (SITCE), which is taking place at the World Cities Summit for the first time this year. Jointly organised by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the International Association of Public Transport, some 100 exhibitors from more than 25 countries and regions are presenting their technologies and services to improve the public transport industry. One of the technologies on display is ST Engineering’s gateless, hands-free fare deduction system. It can use either long-range RFID or facial recognition to detect and identify a passenger walking through the gantry. And passengers won’t have to tap a card or do much else – simply walk through the fare gantry. Bernard Chow, senior vice president of the ST Engineering’s transportation business unit, says this technology allows rail operators to increase passenger volume by 50 per cent. The current industry standard for the speed of fare deduction is 1.5 seconds per passenger, while the gateless technology takes less than a second to do so. It is also a system that is more user-friendly for people with mobility issues. Other technologies on display include an unmanned vehicle that can be used to inspect rail tracks. Currently, rail engineers have to manually inspect the tracks, which can give rise to human error. They also only have a limited amount of time to do so during the trains’ off-service hours, which means they can only complete inspection of tracks up to three stations per night. The unmanned vehicle is able to inspect tracks between eight stations in the same amount of time. Using laser and geothermal imaging, it can also detect cracks as small as 0.3 millimetres, which would enable rail operators to perform preventive maintenance. Mr Alan Chan, chairman of LTA, said at the opening address of SITCE, LTA emphasised long-term operational and maintenance for its railway network.  “We will work with industry partners to propose solutions that are highly maintainable, and are competitively priced on a life-cycle cost basis. We need to establish long-term relationships with our partners to develop local expertise and strengthen the partners’ local presence and capabilities,” he said. Other countries also provided a vision of what public transport could look like in the future. Skyway Technologies Co. from Belarus presented its vision of an elevated rail system that can also run a tram beneath it. It could reduce public transport infrastructure on the whole, and the cost of building and operating it.

I would like to emphasise again that it is oBike’s responsibility to have a concrete plan to refund user deposits and remove its bicycles from public spaces,\" he added.  Last Friday, oBike's provisional liquidators FTI Consulting said it would be liaising with oBike's management to \"discuss whether it is their intention\" to provide refunds to users.  In response to this, Mr Loy York Jiun, executive director for the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), told Channel NewsAsia that oBike had previously committed to raise funds from alternative sources, for example from their shareholders, to provide a full refund of consumers’ deposits.  Following oBike’s exit, another bike-sharing operator Mobike announced that it would be waiving deposits for its Singapore users.  The decision meant that none of the current bicycle sharing operators in Singapore require user deposits.  Dr Puthucheary highlighted that with market pressures and to allow them to better compete with existing operators, incoming operators \"are likely to offer their services without deposits\".  He added that if there are companies which require user deposits when the licensing regime is implemented from October this year, the Land Transport Authority will study the need for the companies to place a \"security deposit or performance bond\".   ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/obike-government-police-report-deposits-not-refunded-10511906"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 02:34PM", "tags": ["crime", "court"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Cleaner who peeped at mother and daughter in toilet of Jurong East Swimming Complex jailed", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 31-year-old man who peeped at a mother and her eight-year-old daughter in the women's toilet at Jurong East Swimming Complex was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Monday (Jul 9). Ge Xiang, a Chinese national, was working as a cleaner at the swimming complex when he committed the offences, the court heard. On Oct 8 last year, at about 8.30pm, a family of three had gone to the swimming complex to take a shower at the public toilets as the bathroom in their home was being renovated. The woman, 33, went into the female toilet with her eight-year-old daughter while her husband went to the men's toilet. Ge was seen sweeping the corridor outside at the time and there was no one else in the female toilet. Mother and daughter went into a cubicle. After they undressed, the mother saw a shadow outside and kept looking up to check if someone was there. She saw Ge's head \"slowly appearing from the cubicle beside hers\", the court heard. When she screamed, Ge lowered his head and fled. He then pretended to re-enter the female toilet and asked whether anyone was inside. The woman shouted at him to leave and called the police. When her husband asked Ge if he saw anyone in the female toilet around the time of the incident, Ge claimed that he saw someone leaving by the stairs. Closed-circuit television footage showed Ge sweeping the corridor outside the female toilet when the family first entered. The footage captured Ge entering the female toilet shortly after the mother and child went inside. According to court documents, Ge had specifically been reminded by his supervisor not to enter the female toilet even before he committed the offence.

He told the judge through an interpreter that he had \"little knowledge of the law\". \"That's why I committed this offence,\" he said.

The planned increase in GST was never meant to finance lumpy investments in infrastructure in the first place, he said, adding that the Government takes a different approach to such investments. First, where possible, the Government will save ahead and set aside funding for such investments through initiatives like the Changi Airport Development Fund and the Rail Infrastructure Fund. Second, the Government will finance infrastructure through borrowing by Statutory Boards and Government-owned companies. This will apply to larger investments that can generate economic benefits over many years, like the Changi Terminal 5, the HSR and the JB-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link, he said. He was responding to Workers’ Party MP Pritam Singh's question on the implications of a potential cancellation of the HSR on the Government's decision to raise GST sometime between 2021 and 2025. The main drivers for rising Government expenditure in recent years, and in the future, are healthcare, security and social spending, Mr Wong said. “These are broad-based, structural increases in recurrent spending, so we have to raise recurrent revenues, of which the planned GST increase is one component, to pay for these ongoing needs year after year,” he said. He also said that it is not appropriate for him to highlight the estimated total expenditure on the HSR project at this time, in response to Mr Singh and Non-Constituency MP Daniel Goh’s questions. “Doing so could affect the behavior and pricing strategy of bidders,” he said.

But working together, he stressed, must be on the basis that \"both sides will fully respect the sanctity of international agreements, and that any disputes are resolved peacefully in accordance with international law\". \"Provided this condition is met, we are confident bilateral relations will prosper, for the mutual benefit of the citizens of both countries,” he said, in response to a parliamentary question filed by MP Christopher de Souza on the state of bilateral relations between both countries. However, he noted that reports on the new Malaysian government’s 1MDB investigations, their intentions to cancel or postpone the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, and their desire to revise the price of water sold to Singapore may have caused some to wonder about how these will affect bilateral ties. Most recently, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had said that the water supply deal with Singapore was “too costly” and that his government needed to re-negotiate the agreement with its neighbour.   Going into details on the price of raw water imported by Singapore from Malaysia under the 1962 Water Agreement, Dr Balakrishnan reiterated Singapore’s “clear and consistent position” on the issue.  He said the water pact is no ordinary agreement, and is guaranteed by both Singapore and Malaysia in the 1965 Separation Agreement. The Separation Agreement, he added, was in turn registered with the United Nations. “Any breach of the 1962 Water Agreement would call into question the Separation Agreement, which is the basis for Singapore’s very existence as an independent sovereign state,” he said. “Singapore will fully honour the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement, including the price of water stipulated, and expects Malaysia also to do so,” he added. Citing points previously made in Parliament in 2003 and 2014 by former Foreign Ministers S Jayakumar and K Shanmugam respectively, Dr Balakrishnan noted that the core issue is not how much is paid, but how any price revision is decided upon. He also reiterated that neither Malaysia nor Singapore can unilaterally change the terms of the agreement between the two countries. Under the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement, Johor currently buys treated water at 50 sen per 1,000 gallons from Singapore. This, said Dr Balakrishnan, is a “fraction of the cost” to Singapore of treating the water. “Malaysia has previously acknowledged that they themselves chose not to ask for a review in 1987 because they benefited from the pricing arrangement under the 1962 Water Agreement,” he said. He added that in 2002, then-Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir had said that Malaysia did not ask for a review when it was due as it knew that any revision would also affect the price of treated water sold by Singapore to Malaysia. If Malaysia had exercised the right to review the price of water then, Dr Balakrishnan said, Singapore might have made different investment decisions on developing the Johor River and its water catchment areas. STABLE AND PROSPEROUS MALAYSIA GOOD FOR SINGAPORE, REGION Dr Balakrishnan said that a stable and prosperous Malaysia is good for Singapore and the region, and there has been a \"high tempo\" of bilateral exchanges since the Malaysian General Election in May.  He spelled out three fundamental principles of Singapore’s foreign policy that he said were “especially salient” with its relationship with Malaysia. The first - upholding international law and respecting the sanctity of international agreements - is “critical” for a small state like Singapore, Dr Balakrishnan said. “Our very existence as a sovereign independent state is derived from the Separation Agreement of 1965,” he said. “International agreements, solemnly entered into by countries, are sacrosanct and they underpin the relationship between sovereign states. They make it possible for countries to co-exist peacefully, to build trust, to work together for the long-term good of our citizens, regardless of changes of governments or circumstances.” The second principle: Any disputes that arise should be resolved in accordance with international law. He brought up the Pedra Branca dispute as an example of how both Singapore and Malaysia had followed the “due legal process”, handled the issue in accordance with international law, and put the matter to rest amicably. The third principle, Dr Balakrishnan said, is about upholding Singapore’s reputation as a credible, trusted and consistent partner, and a country that abides fully by its international obligations. “This reputation, for Singapore, developed over decades, is crucial for our political and economic space,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-malaysia-relations-both-countries-must-fully-respect-10512166"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 02:00PM", "tags": ["crime", "sex"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Man who had sex with 15-year-old girl sentenced to 5 years’ jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 33-year-old assistant engineer who had sex with a 15-year-old girl and introduced her to bondage, sadism and masochism (BDSM) practices was on Monday (Jul 9) sentenced to five years' jail. Lim Chee Keong first got to know the girl, who was then in Secondary 3, in November 2016 on a website where men seek women for paid sex. The teenager, who cannot be named due to a gag order, said on her profile that she was looking for “someone who could afford to pay for my tuition fees”. Lim saw her profile and felt that she looked young, the court heard. He asked about her age and the teenager told him she was 15.  Lim answered that \"it was fine\" and told her to always delete their message correspondences so that no one would find out that they were having sex. The pair exchanged numbers and began chatting on WeChat and WhatsApp. Lim said he was into BDSM and expected the girl to comply. The teenager felt uncomfortable but agreed after Lim said he would pay her an allowance of S$4,000 to S$5,000 per month for a year. HE GAVE HER ALCOHOL, LIQUID TO SNIFF TO MAKE HER \"HIGH\" They met at about 2am on Dec 31, 2016, at a staircase landing near his home where they had sex. Lim also asked the victim to sniff a brown bottle containing liquid in order to get her \"high\". They met again on Jan 21 last year at about 9pm at a hotel. The girl lied to her parents that she would be studying at her friend's place and went to meet Lim. He told her he wanted to try BDSM practices with her, and made her drink glasses of soda mixed with alcohol to ease her anxiety. They then had sex that night and the day after. The girl asked Lim to use a condom during the three times they had sex, but he did not. Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling on Monday asked for a sentence of at least five years' jail and a S$20,000 fine, saying that there was premeditation and planning. Lim had used a prepaid SIM card to contact the teenager, and did not intend to follow through on his promise of a monthly allowance. Instead, he planned to abscond after having sex with the girl, the court heard. He also asked her to delete the messages and made her endure \"multiple painful and humiliating BDSM practices\" as well as inhale harmful substances. In response, defence lawyer Gino Hardial Singh said that Lim was not in a position of trust in relation to the victim. He said that there was no evidence of physical or intellectual disability in the victim, and pointed out that she snuck out of her house to meet the accused the first time and also lied to her parents.  He added that the girl was \"less than a month shy of 16 the first time they met\".  VICTIMS BELOW 16 LACK SEXUAL, EMOTIONAL MATURITY: PROSECUTOR In response, the prosecutor said that there is a need to protect minors from sexual predators like the accused, and consent should not be a mitigating factor. She added that the victim was below 16, and that victims of that age lack sexual and emotional maturity to give informed consent. She said that the impact on the victim was severe enough for the girl's teacher to notice a change in her behaviour, which was how the crime was exposed. The teacher advised the girl to go for counselling, and the girl subsequently told the counsellor that she had unprotected sex with an adult man. District Judge Ng Peng Hong sentenced Lim to five years' jail for three charges of sexual penetration of a minor and one charge of possessing 197 obscene films. \"In my view, the victim in this case has been psychologically impaired by the depraved behaviour,\" he said.  For sexual penetration of a minor under 16, Lim could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. For possessing obscene films, Lim could have been fined at least S$500 per obscene film up to a total of S$20,000 and jailed for up to six months.

The plans include the development of a commercial precinct and the injection of up to 20,000 new homes, the upgrading of Jurong Lake Gardens, and the the development of a major transport hub connecting the existing North-South and East-West MRT Lines and the upcoming Jurong Region and Cross Island Lines. “The land parcels that the Government has acquired are needed to realise these plans,” he said, adding that the Jurong Country Club site will provide for new mixed-use developments and community facilities, while the Raffles Country Club site is needed for the Cross Island Line western depot and other transport related uses.  “The development of Jurong Lake District is part of Singapore’s broader effort to develop urban centres outside the downtown area, so as to bring jobs, amenities and recreational options closer to homes,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/overall-impetus-and-vision-for-jurong-lake-district-remain-10512160"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 01:20PM", "tags": ["trade conflict", "tariffs", "chan chun sing"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "'Greatest concern' if China-US trade conflict escalates to involve major economies: Chan Chun Sing", "content": " SINGAPORE: The ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China will have global repercussions, but the “greatest concern” for Singapore is if it escalates into a “vicious cycle of tit-for-tat measures between major economies”, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Jul 9). Mr Chan, responding to parliamentary questions from MP Henry Kwek and NMP K Thanaletchimi, said that if these measures reach a tipping point that triggers a sharp and sustained fall in global business and consumer confidence, or a tightening of global liquidity conditions, the macroeconomic environment will “fundamentally change”. “In this scenario, the impact on global consumption and investment on top of the disruption to trade flows will significantly impact Singapore’s open economy,” the minister said. He also highlighted two other levels of impact that will affect the local economy. The first is on the impact from higher generalised tariffs that are applicable to the majority of countries, including Singapore. Mr Chan said this affects a “relatively small set of products” here, as these are essentially US tariffs applied globally on solar cells and modules, washing machines, steel and aluminium. Singapore’s exports to the US account for about 0.1 per cent of the country’s total domestic exports to the world. He said while relatively modest, specific Singapore-based companies in the general manufacturing and electronics sectors that export such products to the US will become less competitive compared to manufacturers in the US. Local agencies are in touch with them to facilitate applications for product exclusion and to explore alternative markets, he added. On the second level of impact, Mr Chan pointed there will be indirect impact from tariffs imposed by US and China, as well as those by the European Union, Mexico and Canada in retaliation. While these tariffs do not directly affect Singapore exports, these would have spillover impact due to the country’s role in global supply chains, he added. For instance, companies that produce intermediate goods used in the production of China’s exports to the US may see softer demand, he explained. “The net impact on the Singapore economy and our workers is less easily quantified given the fluidity of the US and China’s tit-for-tat responses,” Mr Chan said, adding there will be potential for firms to mitigate some of the impact by redirecting exports of intermediate goods to other markets. He added that MTI’s modelling indicates that based on the tariffs on product lines that have been announced, the net impact is “likely to be modest” assuming no further escalation in trade tensions between both countries. “On the whole, bilateral trade between the US and China indirectly contributes to 1.1 per cent of Singapore’s GDP, and any sustained disruption is unwelcome for the region. In the meantime, our economic agencies are working closely with companies to identify any disruptions promptly and restructure their supply chains where necessary,” the minister said. Mr Chan also reiterated the country’s stance, stating its external linkages that have made it more resilient in facing uncertainties in the global economy are “best safeguarded by a strong set of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and enforcement, and by our network of Free Trade Agreements”. “We are in good standing with all our trading partners, including the US and China, and have urged that ongoing trade disputes be resolved through negotiation,” he said.   “We have also forged ahead with like-minded partners to continue paving the way for regional integration to bring about more opportunities and growth.” This includes the signing of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in March this year, and the ongoing efforts to reach the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), he pointed out.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/greatest-concern-if-china-us-trade-conflict-escalates-to-involve-10512136"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 12:58PM", "tags": ["Dining", "Burger King", "Rendang", "Chicken Rice", "National Day"], "author": "May Seah", "title": "Rendang Beef and Hainanese Tendergrill Chicken burgers back at Burger King", "content": " SINGAPORE: Burger King is bringing back two old favourites: The Double Rendang Beef burger and the Hainanese Tendergrill Chicken burger.

Mr Khaw said the deadline to do so was Jun 30, but it did not happen as Prasarana Malaysia suspended discussions with SMRT after the country’s general election earlier in May this year. “This means that both countries should now proceed to call an open, international tender to appoint the RTS Link operator, unless we mutually agree on a postponement of the deadline,” he added. Mr Khaw also pointed to a Channel NewsAsia report on May 30 citing Malaysia Transport Minister Anthony Loke who said the RTS project will proceed, although the government will “restudy the project in terms of cost and so on”. \"I was made to understand that the cost of the project is RM4 billion (US$1 billion) for the Malaysian government but of course we are looking at how to reduce cost ... we have just made the decision, we have to initiate negotiations and discussions with our counterparts in Singapore,” Mr Loke said during the May 30 interview. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The RTS Link was mooted to ease congestion at the land checkpoints and make it more convenient for people to travel between both countries.

Mr Khaw said in Parliament that following numerous statements by Malaysian leaders, including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, on the HSR project over the past two months, these suggest that Malaysia no longer intends to continue with the rail project linking its capital of Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The bilateral agreement signed in December 2016 is an international treaty to build a High-Speed Rail allowing travellers to commute from Jurong Lake District to the Bandar Malaysia development in KL in 90 minutes. Singapore subsequently sent the diplomatic note to clarify Malaysia’s position on the matter but, to date, it has not received a reply. “The public statements made by the Malaysian ministers, and Prime Minister Dr Mahathir himself, on the termination of the project have not been followed through with any official communications to us,” Mr Khaw said. RISING COSTS Thus, Singapore has been “left with no choice” but to continue with its end of the agreement, the minister added. Based on preliminary estimates, the Government has spent more than S$250 million on the HSR project by the end of May this year, and this includes costs for consultancies to design the civil infrastructure, costs for dedicating manpower to oversee and deliver the project and costs for land acquisition, he said. “This is actual money that has already been spent, our taxpayers' money,” said Mr Khaw. “We can recover value for some of the expenditure, even if the HSR project does not proceed. But a significant amount which has been spent will be completely wasted expenditure if the project does not proceed.” The Transport Minister added that in the month of June, Singapore incurred more than S$6 million costs for the project, while the same amount is expected for July. These costs will increase rapidly with time, with at least S$40 million more expected to be spent from August to the end of 2018 for ongoing manpower costs, operating expenses and contract costs, he added. “It will be most unfortunate, if Malaysia has in fact decided to terminate, but delays in notifying us, because there will be further wasted expenditure,” Mr Khaw said. He added that besides Singapore’s incurred costs, interested rail consortia from China, Japan and Europe, among others, have also spent money preparing their bids. Following the statements from Malaysia’s leaders, they have “sought urgent clarification” from both countries on the project’s status, he added. COMPENSATION, NOT PENALTY The minister also took the opportunity to stress that the HSR bilateral agreement signed is a “fair treaty” with equal rights and obligations on both sides. He also noted it was Malaysia that suggested the project and Singapore agreed as it was convinced of its benefits.  Mr Khaw said: “If the HSR project is terminated because of the actions of country A, then country A should compensate country B for expenses that have already been incurred by country B, in accordance with the bilateral agreement. “It would not be fair for the taxpayers of one country to bear the cost of another country’s actions. Compensation is not a penalty imposed on the other country. “Thus, should Malaysia cause the HSR project to be terminated, we will deal with the question of compensation from Malaysia for costs incurred by Singapore in accordance with the bilateral agreement and international law,” the minister said. Dr Mahathir, in an interview with the Financial Times on May 28, said the HSR project will be dropped and Malaysia may have to pay “almost 500 million” as a “penalty” though he was unsure of the currency. He confirmed this in a press conference that same day. Mr Khaw also pointed out that as the costs incurred by Singapore will add to the total amount of compensation, “it is in Malaysia’s own interest to officially inform us of its position on the HSR project early on to minimise the amounts involved”. He had highlighted this to Economic Affairs Minister Azmin Ali when the latter called on him on Jun 6, during which the Malaysian minister suggested both countries’ officials meet to discuss the project. Mr Khaw said he agreed and asked for details on the scope of discussion and the Malaysia minister said he will send a letter on the details, but the latter “has yet to do so”. “The Singapore Government will continue to press for official clarification from the Malaysian Government. There are appropriate processes at law in case Malaysia should wish to propose changes to the bilateral agreement, or to terminate it,” Mr Khaw said. “These due processes should be followed. If the Malaysian government fails to provide an official response, then we cannot ignore the public statements made by the Malaysian ministers, and Prime Minister Dr Mahathir himself, on the termination of the project, and Singapore will act according to its rights.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/high-speed-rail-singapore-spent-250-million-malaysia-no-reply-10511910"}, {"datetime": "09 Jul 2018 11:23AM", "tags": ["PUB", "water", "Enterprise Singapore", "Economic Development Board"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Singapore water industry contributes S$2.5b in value added to economy annually, creates 14,400 jobs to date", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore’s water industry has contributed S$2.5 billion in annual value-add to the economy and created 14,400 jobs to date, putting it on track to meet its 2020 targets.  Latest figures from national water agency PUB, the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore showed that since 2016, the sector has added 400 jobs and contributed S$300 million in value-added to the economy annually. “Singapore’s water sector continues to experience strong growth, with a robust water ecosystem anchoring Singapore as a leading global hydrohub,” the agencies said in a joint statement on Monday (Jul 9). This growth is important amid the growing risks of poorly managed urbanisation, climate change and infectious disease threats in developing countries and across the globe, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said on Monday. Mr Tharman was speaking at the joint opening ceremony of the Singapore International Water Week, World Cities Summit and CleanEnviro Summit. “Water is also a good example of how we are growing our efforts in Singapore to help stimulate and share innovation around the challenges and opportunities facing cities around the world,” he added. “If the problems are not tackled effectively in any one part of the world, they will inevitably spill over into the rest of the world – whether through the spread of infectious disease, forced migration or the spread of conflict and insecurity.” The three agencies will tap on Singapore’s strengths in water to focus on three areas: Developing global solutions, accelerating the commercialisation and export of technologies and building a range of capabilities and talent. In the area of developing global solutions, EDB has secured at least three new international companies to set up research and development centres or expand their base in Singapore. The areas of focus include desalination and wastewater recycling. To accelerate commercialisation and the export of technologies, PUB’s Singapore Water Exchange will house an ecosystem of companies along the water value chain, allowing them to work together and tap on mutual strengths to push water innovation and business growth. The Singapore Water Exchange will begin operations later this year. As for building a range of capabilities and talent, Enterprise Singapore is working with water technology small- and medium-sized enterprises to transform their business models and improve their productivity, turning them into higher value players.

The average cost of employing an expat in Singapore has shrunk by over S$16,070 in 2017 compared to the year before, yet the value of a typical annual compensation and benefits package for a middle-manager stands at S$223,095. The impression one goes away with is that a Singaporean middle manager comes at a “bargain price” to most firms. If so, why do many companies still hire expats? LOWER UNIT LABOUR COSTS When a firm wants to hire an executive, the labour cost is only half the story. Is he worth the money? How much can he value add? The firm would want to know how much that executive can bring to the table.  In a business decision, the firm would consider unit labour cost (ULC) - the total labour cost over value added when it has to decide whether to employ an executive. Assuming rationality, firms would only hire expats over locals if their ULC was lower. The labour costs these expats command are high - likely because many originate from higher-income countries, and may have houses and families back home to maintain. Costs of moving a person to another county may justifiably be higher, where this includes rental, children’s education at international schools, and travel back home for the holidays to see friends and family. Being away used to be seen as a hardship that comes with an allowance compared to salaries they draw at home. But what about value-added? Do expats really have higher skills and a stronger track record compared to Singaporeans? There may be a self-selection dynamic, where it is said that it is the most talented, highly-educated and socially mobile who go abroad. This is especially pertinent in filling senior positions. Most advertisements for the position of CEO often include relevant overseas working experience as one of the necessary though not sufficient conditions.  Most expats who head top companies have significant experience managing overseas business operations.  In contrast, many Singaporeans do not meet this criterion and are almost immediately disqualified from even a first round of consideration. The good news is, this trend is shifting as more young Singaporeans are studying and working overseas.  Another reason might be the principal-agent problem. Company shareholders or founders want to employ the best person for the job with the lowest unit labour cost and the Singapore Government ostensibly want companies to consider hiring locals first. But in many foreign multinational corporations, the hiring manager who acts as the agent may employ an expat because they themselves are from those countries and they find it easier to work with someone of a similar background, or because they encounter many of such candidates in their professional circles. INCREASING SINGAPOREANS’ COMPETITIVENESS There are three ways we can increase the competitiveness of Singaporean candidates and also address the issue where expats are seen to be more qualified than locals, thereby raising salary of Singaporean executives.  The Singapore Government has been on the ball in this aspect. They have leadership programmes to allow Singaporeans to work overseas to gain valuable exposure – including the expansion of the NUS Overseas Campus into the Global Innovation Alliance.  The NTUC also has a similar programme - the U Future Leaders’ Programme to target young and promising Singaporeans so that they have an opportunity to lead overseas operations.  Our Ministry of Manpower has a duty to ensure that firms in Singapore consider Singaporean candidates first before they are allowed to recruit overseas candidates – and have exercised this duty.  The Ministry had in the past identified companies who write off locals because they have pre-conceived notions that they are unwilling or unable to do the job. Placed on the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist, these companies then have their employment pass subject to additional scrutiny. But more can be done. Firms with poor records of employing Singaporeans in high-level positions should be told to submit documents to account for the recruitment process.  Yet it is a fine line where going all out to demand Singaporeans be hired might make Singapore seem protectionist, unfriendly to business or worse, discourage foreign firms from trying to set up business here altogether.  ENHANCING SINGAPORE’S ATTRACTIVENESS A better way to increase salary of Singaporeans is to make Singapore an attractive place for quality investment or headquarter operations. Why would a firm want to invest in Singapore? The answer lies in Singapore’s unit business cost (UBC) - the ratio of business cost over corporate earnings.  Singapore as a city has to be cost-competitive. But cost competitiveness is measured in terms of UBC – which measures the ease of doing business. A commonly used proxy is the business cost over its capita GDP, in which Singapore scores high on.  Mumbai’s UBC is 14 times that of Singapore’s and Shanghai’s three times more. Starting a business in these two places comes with greater compliance requirements, they are less connected and traveling around these congested cities take more time. Unfortunately, Singapore’s quality investment does not come from these two cities but London, New York and Tokyo – cities of comparable UBC. We stand a good chance to attract their plants and operations to come to Singapore if Singapore can ensure that business costs remain low while GDP per capita increases. If Singapore can maintain cost competitiveness over cities in developed countries, we can continue to attract quality investment. High value-added operations will then replace the low value-added operations in Singapore and salaries will be higher for both local and expats. It is worth noting that most of our anxieties about how much expats are paid sometimes stem from the fact that we leave out our CPF contributions when calculating our own annual pay packages. Once we factor those in, the gap may not be as large as it is perceived to be.

Hyflux also needs to submit a written confirmation that the extensions do not contravene any laws and regulations governing the company, as well as the articles of association of the company, according to the SGX filing.  On why it needed the extensions, the local firm said since it made the application on May 22 for court supervision over its business and debt reorganisation, there has been “a standstill on the payment of all pre-May 22, 2018 debts”.  It is also facing stringent controls on the usage of its cash, such as only paying critical expenses relevant to the reorganisation.  With the company still negotiating reorganisation terms under a court-supervised process and a six-month moratorium granted by the High Court on Jun 19, the release of financial statements before in-principle agreement of any agreement terms or clarity on the main terms of any financing proposals may “result in inaccurate and incomplete reflection of financial information\". “It is anticipated that the ongoing discussions surrounding the reorganisation will require at least the time for which the moratorium is granted, and it will only be meaningful for the company to start to prepare the relevant financial statements only when it has certainty regarding the terms of the reorganisation and any financing proposals, which is expected to take additional time,” it said.  Earlier this week, Tuaspring – the Hyflux subsidiary that owns the Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Plant – withdrew an application for a debt moratorium after reaching an agreement with its only secured creditor Maybank.

We have engineered solutions to send us to the moon, explored the deepest depths of the ocean, and split the atom. We have written music and produced art that stirs the soul. We have produced criminals and masterminds.  But for all of mankind’s ingenuity to improve an understanding of the world, we retain a tendency to generalise and compartmentalise things. There is an underlying assumption that we are all created equal. There is the underlying belief that we can deal with our body and mind separately with complete agency. This is not the case. It is obvious that the mind and body work together. A clear example would be insomnia caused by mental stress. Overtime, sleep deprivation will wreak havoc on the body and lead to serious physical health problems. MUSICIANS, ARTISTS, MATHEMATICIANS AND THOSE VULNERABLE TO CERTAIN DISEASES The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international, collaborative research programme created with the goal of complete mapping and understanding of all the genes of human beings. The HGP has revealed that there are probably about 20,500 human genes, each gene contributing to the human makeup to a different degree. The cumulative effects of these genes result in who each of us are today. Some of us will be better musicians or artists, some of us will be good at mathematics and some of us might even be able to better understand quantum mechanics. The variations and therefore the possibilities are endless. This also means that some of us are more vulnerable to developing certain diseases. Examples of diseases with a strong genetic link include cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia and Tay-Sachs disease (which is rare in the general population but relatively common in Ashkenazi Jews). Other diseases may not have such a strong link, but do show some degree of genetic involvement. Mental illnesses fall within this category. PEAK GROUPS Most major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety disorders have multiple causal factors. While there is a clear hereditary or genetic contribution, childhood factors, personality and environmental factors all play a part in the development of mental illnesses. Mental illnesses can strike at any age. However, for most of them, there are peak age groups for the onset of the disease. Schizophrenia, a major mental disorder in which a person would experience hallucinations and abnormal beliefs, commonly appears in early adulthood for males and slightly later for females. Bipolar disorder, a mood disorder characterised by extreme mood swings, commonly appears in early adulthood to when someone is in their 30s. Both anxiety disorders and depressive disorders also tend to manifest in early adulthood. LIFE-CYCLE STRESSES As we go through life, we will face major events that can cause no small degree of stress. Exams are often cited as a common cause of stress for the young. In young adults, having to face the final years of education, exploring relationships, dealing with new jobs, getting married, moving to a new home and starting a family are major life events that may have positive connotations but can be causes of stress nonetheless. In the later years, dealing with family or the lack of, career and eventually retirement can be sources of stress as well. There are also upsetting events that can strike anyone at any time. Illness and the death of a loved one are good examples. DON’T RULE OUT TRIGGERS Most of us will be able to navigate through life and cope with each event as it comes along. However, when there is an existing genetic vulnerability coupled with other factors such as childhood abuse or trauma, the lack of social and family support or even several events happening at the same time can trigger a mental illness. Once triggered, a delay in seeking treatment or incomplete treatment can increase difficulties and the risk of the illness relapsing. Unfortunately, it has been shown that with each relapse, the chances of recidivism also increase. However, the converse can also happen. Despite having a genetic vulnerability or pre-disposition, changes in other factors can help prevent the development of a mental illness. Having a healthy upbringing with positive childhood experiences, good family and social support, a healthy and balanced lifestyle, and matured ways of coping with stress can help build resilience and prevent the development of mental illnesses. Indeed, this is why in twin studies, it is never a definitive chance that both identical twins will develop the same mental illness. Similarly, once having developed a mental illness, it is not just medication that makes a difference. Repeated studies have shown that early detection and proper treatment improves the long-term prognosis of the illness. Beyond that, good physical and mental health promotes recovery and helps in prevention of future relapses. LIVE WELL TO COPE WELL We all go through mixed experiences. We all have different reactions to these experiences. For some people, mental illness develops due to a combination of influences including genetics, childhood experiences and a host of other factors such as personality, the presence of other disorders, illnesses, drugs or alcohol misuse and the lack of a support structure. Living well, leading a healthy lifestyle, having a good balance of rest, work, exercise and recreational time, having time for yourself, friends and family, having a faith and contributing to society in terms of helping others − all these, while small tasks in themselves, make a difference. They help to build resilience and help us cope with the challenges of modern day life, in turn helping with the prevention and recovery of mental illness. Much like exploring the deepest depths of the ocean, we are only at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding mental illness.

Mrs Wee had just celebrated her 102nd birthday on Friday. She had suffered from breathing difficulties on Friday, which worsened the next day, according to her daughter, Ms Wee Eng Hwa, who spoke to The Straits Times. She told the paper that Mrs Wee was sent to Changi General Hospital on Saturday night but could not be resuscitated. Koh Sok Hiong was best known as the woman behind Dr Wee whom she married in 1936, when he was just a 21 year-old reporter. The couple's devotion to each other was well-known. And long before Dr Wee became President, she was already a constant presence by his side in his career, first as a journalist, and then a diplomat. The couple had one son and six daughters. Their marriage played such a central role in his life that Dr Wee included a reflective essay called \"Till Death Do Us Part\" in his memoirs. He wrote: \"Those who are going to make marriage vows - no matter what form they take - should think seriously about what they mean. Vows are made to be kept and one's word is one's bond.\" In a Facebook post on Sunday, President Halimah Yacob said she and her husband were \"deeply saddened\" on hearing the passing of Mrs Wee and conveyed their condolences to her family. \"Mrs Wee was an unsung heroine in Singapore’s history. As the wife of one of our most well-loved Presidents, she served the people with grace. She was a steadfast advocate of education and providing opportunities for disadvantaged children and youth. Active in supporting charitable causes in these areas during Dr Wee’s presidency, Mrs Wee continued to do so in later years,\" the President said.  She added that Singaporeans will remember Mrs Wee for her selfless dedication to the late Dr Wee.  \"Throughout their 69 years of marriage, Mrs Wee always stood by and supported Dr Wee.

But how long is too long to wait, even for a Michelin-approved meal? While Michelin stars used to be solely associated with starched white tablecloths and eye-watering price tags, its glory has taken on a slightly different flavour in Singapore. In 2016, Michelin Guide Singapore bestowed a coveted star each to two hawker stalls - Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle, now better known as Hawker Chan. Along with these accolades came the snaking, neverending queues. The human traffic is especially chronic at Hawker Chan’s original stall at Chinatown Complex Food Centre, where the hungry and the curious assemble every day. But is it worth waiting up to an hour (or more) for a plate of what some claim is the best chicken in town? “The rice was a little soft for my liking but the chicken was nice,” said a local, who braved the lunch crowd and sweltering temperatures at the behest of her friend who was visiting from overseas. “My friend really wanted to try it, she said it was really nice, but I thought it was only okay.” Ahead of the Michelin Guide Singapore unveiling their star picks for 2018 on Jul 25, we look at five other Michelin-worthy eats in the area for foodies who believe that a good meal doesn't always have to come with an official seal of approval. Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao (#02-135, Chinatown Complex Food Centre) Right across from Hawker Chan is a dumpling stall that has earned a Michelin Guide Singapore mention but has curiously not received a star despite their exceptional and affordable fare. Skip the “la mian” or pulled noodles and zero in on their “xiao long bao”. These soup dumplings have all the hallmarks of a xiao long bao one might expect to find at a ritzier establishment - delicate skin, rich broth and flavourful pork filling. Not only do these made-from-scratch morsels give Din Tai Fung a serious run for their money, but they also pack excellent value at S$6 for ten pieces. Also noteworthy are their pan-fried dumplings (S$6) as well as the szechuan spicy wantons (S$4.50). The latter, which comes dressed in a mix of chili oil and chili flakes, pairs best with black vinegar. Opening hours: 11.30am - 3.00pm and 5.00pm - 8.30pm. (Closed Mon and Tue) Ma Li Ya (Maria) Signature Virgin Chicken (#02-189, Chinatown Complex Food Centre) Novel name aside, there are no gimmicks when it comes to their chicken rice. Each translucent grain is toothsome, and generously seasoned with sesame oil and a hint of ginger. Their soya sauce chicken is tender and boasts burnished, glazed skin. However, the runaway winner has to be their beancurd (S$1.40), which bathes in a superior soya sauce blend until it’s ready to be plated upon order. Think of it as a savoury “tau huay” or soya beancurd pudding - but better. The outer layers, dyed brown from the marinade, provide a savoury counterpoint to its still-pale centre. These jiggly silken blocks are so in demand that there’s a minimum order of five pieces for takeaway requests. Truly a near-religious experience befitting their moniker. Opening hours: 7.30am - 4.00pm (Closed Mon and Fri). Fei Ye Ye Food Tradition (#02-177, Chinatown Complex Food Centre) In the “blue zone” of the food centre, just a row away from Hawker Chan, is an old-school joint that specialises in springy wanton noodles. Although they also offer soya sauce chicken, the trophy goes to their dumplings or “sui gao” noodles (S$3). Literally made fresh every morning, these delicate parcels pack a unique flavour and textural punch courtesy of the filling made from minced pork, water chestnut cubes, shredded carrots and generous chunks of prawn. The dumplings also come in a bowl of five pieces for S$3 - perfect for sharing (or not). Those with larger appetites can also opt for add-ons of their handmade wantons or braised chicken feet. Opening hours: 6.30am - 2.30pm (Closed Mon and Tue) Teochew Street Mushroom Minced Meat Noodle (#02-023 Chinatown Complex Food Centre) It’s always a good sign when a stall has an abbreviated menu but still continues to draw a steady stream of regulars. Although Teochew Street only serves two dishes - fishball noodles and “bak chor mee” or minced pork noodles - their unique take on both local classics warrants a repeat visit. While minced pork noodle purists may baulk at the absence of a strong vinegar flavour, Teochew Street’s version is seasoned to allow their fresh ingredients to shine. Their iteration of bak chor mee (S$3 and S$4) is served with a bouncy homemade fishball that is shaped and boiled per order. The firm noodles are further complemented by the addition of chili flakes, pork balls, braised shiitake mushrooms and a generous dose of fried lard. Opening hours: 12.30pm - 6.00pm (Closed on Fridays). Bai Nian Yong Tau Foo (#01-1144, People’s Park Food Centre) Although the line can stretch on during peak hours, service is prompt because, unlike other “yong tau foo” stalls, Bai Nian serves a fixed combination in two sizes - no modifications allowed and only one broth and one type of noodle are on offer. No laksa, no tom yum soup, no complaints. Also departing from convention is their incorporation of prawn and pork paste in addition to their smooth fish mix. A large bowl with extra fixings (S$5.50) nets you eight pieces, all made a la minute - prawn paste balls, minced pork nuggets, bitter gourd and a several stuffed tofu skin rolls. The optional addition of bee hoon is included in the price, and upsizing is free. Their addictive broth, made from a base of anchovies and yellow beans, is pleasantly sweet and good to the last drop, without the thirst-inducing afterburn of MSG.

It was a whirl of activity at the Esplanade outdoor theatre, as students from various schools around Singapore showcased the best of their dance abilities at a special Singapore Youth Festival celebration performance held late last month. Set against the backdrop of the Singapore River and the twinkling city lights, it was a true visual spectacle. But one item stood out. Not for its elaborate costumes, as the dancers were simply dressed in white tops and brightly coloured denim jeans. It was also not for the complexity of the moves or their intricate footwork, for the moves were simple, and easily executed. But it was the awareness that the students on stage had overcome many obstacles to get to where they were that made members of the audience whip out their mobile phones and cameras, and cheer loudly for the performers. It was a dance improvisation piece titled ‘Connectivity’, the result of a collaboration between Boon Lay Secondary School and St Andrew’s Autism School (SAAS), a special education school for those diagnosed with moderate to severe autism. OVERCOMING OBSTACLES In a short introduction to the performance, SAAS dance teacher Cindy Zhuang summed up the experience for the audience. “It might be very simple movements, and maybe you can even do it yourself,” she told them. “But to these students, it’s one big notch up on their list.” Ms Zhuang, a former freelance dance instructor who now teaches dance full-time at SAAS, knew right from the start that it was not going to be easy when her school was invited to collaborate with the dancers from Boon Lay Secondary. But she went ahead, believing that her students would blossom. “I was as frank as I can,” she said, recalling the first discussion she had with her counterparts from Boon Lay. “I told them that I’ve tried modern contemporary dance with my students, and it doesn’t work.” “The one thing they cannot do is imagine,” she explained. “You cannot tell them that you want “soft arms”, because they will think, what do you mean by soft arms? My arms aren’t soft”. The next barrier, she said, was communication and physical contact. The initial awkwardness of a first meeting was made even worse when she realised that the Boon Lay dancers were all girls, when the two schools had their first combined rehearsal. “We went through the teenage phase, and you want a girl to touch a boy ... and some of my boys are non-verbal,” she said. “I saw awkward moments, like when they were asked to hold hands,” she said, chuckling. “Some of my boys were also not used to unfamiliar faces, and they started dashing around.” But she is thankful for the support she got from her students’ parents, as well as the flexibility of her Boon Lay Secondary counterparts. One logistical issue they initially faced, she explained, was the difficulty in scheduling combined rehearsals for both schools, which are located at the opposite ends of Singapore. “I was worried that my students would have meltdowns in the bus if it’s stuck in a jam during peak hour,” she said. “So I was so grateful when the Boon Lay teachers said they would come down to us instead.” “Each time when the girls come, I always tell them that I cannot thank them enough. If there is another word greater than thank you, I would use it.” Ms Zhuang also conducted a briefing for the Boon Lay students. She told them more about autism, and how each student is unique. Each student was also briefed on the traits and preferences of their individual partners. “The girls took the feedback very well, and by the end of the next rehearsal, I could see they were much more confident.” BUILDING CONFIDENCE THROUGH DANCE  That confidence was also seen in 16-year-old Jovan Tan, one of Ms Zhuang's dance students. He appears nervous, but has a ready smile for his friends and teachers. Strapped in the bus seat next to him is a Pokemon soft toy, which he says is his “lucky charm” for the combined rehearsal at the Esplanade that the students are en route to. He once refused to dance unless Ms Zhuang played a special song about dinosaurs. But today, he moves with confidence on stage, easily linking hands with his partner, Boon Lay Secondary student Gabriella Roselyn, forming a bridge with his arms and swaying to the beat of the music. Dance, says his older sister Tan Li Xuan, has done him a world of good. “He wasn’t that verbal previously,” she said. “But now, he’s getting more talkative and will tell us what he did in school.” “When he’s at home, he also sometimes plays songs on YouTube and just dances along to them.” But beyond this, psychologists also point out the benefits students with autism get from regular interaction with their mainstream peers. “Social interactions help children with autism increase awareness and shape socially-appropriate behaviour,” said Linda Lim, a senior psychologist with St Andrew’s Autism Centre. She explained that children with autism tend to have deficits in social communication skills, and difficulties in emotional expression. “Due to these challenges, children with autism may feel anxious in a social setting.” “Being involved in the dance performance collaboration would also help improve their self-esteem, as they feel they are involved and contributing to the community,” she added. Beyond this, principal consultant from the Autism Resource Centre Lam Chee Meng noted that going through the regular rehearsals can also build language and cognitive skills. “These rehearsals can take a long time, and this helps them build their stamina,” he said. “That’s actually a very important work skill in later life.” OPENING UP THEIR HEARTS AND MINDS  But the benefits of such collaborations do, in fact, cut both ways. “The mainstream students learn to realise that people who may be imperfect can still be relied on, because they have strengths that we may not have,” explained Dr Lam. “I think it will help them with accepting, understanding and building respect for each other.” And indeed, the transformation of the Boon Lay Secondary students over the course of the collaboration was evident, according to Siti Aishah Zahara, one of the teachers-in-charge for contemporary dance. “When we first told the girls about the collaboration, they were open to the idea, but I could tell they were scared,” she said. “And when we went over to SAAS and met the students for the first time, I could literally see my girls curling up in their seats, which is really not like them.” “Some of them also haven’t been exposed to students with autism before, because we don’t usually have them in mainstream schools,” she added. “But they have opened up their hearts and minds to accept those who may be different from them. And who knows? Maybe they’ll be inspired to help out in such schools in future.” She has lofty dreams for her students. But in the meantime, progress is charted in baby steps. Jovan’s partner, Gabriella, beamed as she recalled how Jovan – whom she initially described as “a bit shy” – was eventually coaxed out of his shell. “Some of the other students who are partnered up with my friends don’t really recognise them,” she said. “But every time, Jovan remembers me.” “That makes me happy.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/best-foot-forward-how-a-simple-dance-performance-changed-these-10502788"}, {"datetime": "08 Jul 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["nightlife", "Dennis Foo", "On the Record"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Business challenges, courtroom dramas and casinos: 'Nightlife King' Dennis Foo goes On the Record", "content": " SINGAPORE: “I’m not a drunkard, okay,” says Dennis Foo as we look back on his career as Singapore’s \"Nightlife King\". He also emphasises that while he is a known proponent of casinos as a tourist attraction, he is “no gambler”. After 35 years of building and leading some of Singapore’s most popular nightspots such as St James Power Station, the country’s largest one-stop nightlife destination, Mr Foo decided to retire in 2014. Today, the 65-year-old’s face might be wizened, but his eyes tell a different story. While they possess a depth that is reflective of his decades of experience, they frequently come alight with an almost innocent, youthful exuberance as he talks about his ideas for the local nightlife and F&B industry during our interview. But first, he wants to set the record straight. Just because he chose a career in nightlife and frequently hung out in clubs, he is not an alcoholic. “Everybody assumes I drink all the time. I was there to run a business, not get drunk.” However, he confesses to “really enjoying” his whisky and wine. Since retirement, pairing his meals carefully with alcohol to “bring out the best in the food” has become a frequent pastime. His retirement routine includes an early breakfast at the neighbourhood coffeeshops and short walks to work off the prata, lontong, nasi lemak or the pork porridge he might have. He catches up with old friends at the Singapore Cricket Club twice a week.  “But most of the time I will want to be with my wife whether dining out or staying at home where she sips her wine and I drink my whisky while watching Korean or HK TVB movies.” To listen to the full interview, click here. Mr Foo stepped down as CEO of St James Holdings after a reverse takeover deal with property developer Perennial Real Estate Holdings. Although the company had been seeing healthy profits, he cited a saturation in the nightlife business scene, higher business costs and the costs of keeping a company listed as reasons for the deal. It saw Perennial's assets injected into Catalist-listed St James which transformed St James into a real estate developer combining Perennial's assets in Singapore and China. St James’ entertainment business was divested and taken private under CityBar Holdings. Mr Foo is CityBar’s chairman while his son, Gordon is its managing director. OBSTACLES IN THE NIGHTLIFE BUSINESS However, in April this year, live Mandopop music venue and nightclub Shanghai Dolly in Clarke Quay managed by CityBar Holdings had to close its doors. The younger Mr Foo cited the introduction of shortened liquor licensing hours in 2013 to curb unruly drunken behaviour as a key reason. He had said that business had decreased by 30 per cent since then.  While, Mr Foo describes nightlife as a “tough business”, he never discouraged his son from entering the business. “He has an interest in it. But to stay relevant, you need to be ever changing and keep up with the times as it’s trend sensitive. Over and above this, it’s especially tough in Singapore because of the small market and high costs of operations. However, if we can create a few world-beating concepts in Singapore and duplicate it overseas, then the scalability is still there. That’s what I have told my son.” But he, like many other operators in Clarke Quay, still feels that the Government’s shortened licensing rules are unfair, even though I put it to him that law and order issues should not be ignored for the sake of business.  “You are punishing the diligent operators along with the delinquents. Not all the bars have problems controlling their patrons. You should catch the people who are creating law and order issues. You punish them and make them an example That is the way to solve the problem. Instead, you go and penalize all operators. \"When operators came in, they were willing to pay high rents with the understanding that it was a 24-hour party zone. Once you take that away, of course it will hurt business and make it harder to even pay rent.\" While Shanghai Dolly had never received demerit points for incidents of unruly drunkenness, St James Power Station, which is subleased to several clubs, was in the news last year for several incidents, including a murder that took place outside the club. One of the clubs even had its public entertainment licence suspended after preliminary investigations by the police found that a vice syndicate was offering sexual services there.  Mr Foo assures me that measures have been put in place to prevent such incidents, but maintains his stance that there are better, more targeted ways of dealing with such issues. NOT BEING ABLE TO RELATE ANYMORE I ask him why he decided to retire when he is still clearly passionate about the business. “I can’t relate to the market as well as I did before. One of the major things for me when I started was being able to relate to the music and being able to bring in live bands that would draw in the crowds. These days, I can’t relate to the music at all. For example, rap. It’s just not in my DNA. To reinvent the business, this is important. So if I can’t be passionate about it, why continue?” It was his passion for mainstream pop music of the 1980s that spurred him to turn his father’s Europa Restaurant in Changi Village into a lounge. His father set it up as a western food restaurant in 1979, but died of cancer a year later. “His last words then to me were, 'Take care of this place'. I had worked behind the cash register and bar at Europa, but his words made me realise I had to do more. “Music is something I always liked since university days. I used to bring bands into campus. So I decided that I would do the same for Europa.” At the time, live entertainment was mostly only allowed in hotel lobby lounges. He had to make an extra effort to obtain a license for Europa which was in a residential area. He had to do it gradually. “The first few times, I would apply for temporary week-long licenses during festive periods, like the year-end Christmas and New Year period and Chinese New Year. That meant that every other month or every month I had to go to the licensing unit. I had to make sure that we had no incidents and noise complaints.   \"One day, I think the lady at the licensing unit got tired of me seeing me so she said 'Okay, I’ll grant you a full-year license'. It was unprecedented at that time for a bar in a residential area,” he says, clearly proud of his achievement.   His belief that live entertainment was key to his business saw him to go to great lengths to optimise conditions for bands and performers. For example, he would buy premium instruments such as pianos and keyboards to facilitate their performances. For Singaporean singer Anita Sarawak, he and a friend built a cordless microphone that would enable her to move around the room and interact with the audience while performing. “Nowadays cordless microphones are common. In the 80s, not so, but I had a friend who graduated from polytechnic and he created a transmitter that was attached to a normal microphone and we had a radio receiver that could transmit very good quality sound. So I invited Anita to perform by showing her that we could help make her performance better with this.” “I WAS THE ELDEST SON. THE BURDEN WAS ON ME.” Before he made it big in the nightlife scene, he endured trials and tribulations that seem to haunt him till today. As an arts undergraduate, he had to drop out of university to help pay off his mother’s debts. “She was a businesswoman running a goldsmith shop but her business failed because she was cheated by her employees at that time. So I asked for compassionate leave of absence from school to settle all this. I was the eldest son. The burden was on me.” He sold insurance for a while to earn money and also worked as a director of a factory building filing cabinets for offices. “We sold some assets, but also my girlfriend’s father was in the goldsmith business. I invited him to be in partnership with my family and that revived the jewellery business.” Did he consider returning to school after that? “In those days, fresh graduates would earn about S$800. I was already earning a few thousand running Europa by then, so I didn’t. But I do think about it sometimes. Maybe I should go back and finish my degree. When I don’t complete something, I don’t feel good.” I wonder if he felt any resentment towards his mother as her problems were the chief reason for this. “Yes, I felt resentment, but it’s not my style to lash out. In those days, I just focused on the problem and solved it.  Later on I was upset at the situation, but I couldn’t regret it too much. You have to move on.” BUSINESS FAILURES AND COURTROOM DRAMAS There were more trials to come. Two themed theatre lounges he opened - Peppermint Park and Atlantis -  did not make it. They closed during the 1987 recession and made a loss of S$4 million. These failures also had to do with “a lack of market research”. “People were not ready for a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed lounge like Peppermint Park for instance. I should have looked into it more.” He circled back to Europa and decided to corporatise it with three partners. By the mid-90s, Europa was the biggest pub and bar chain in the country. Then came yet another trial. He and his partners made a bid of S$100 million for a plot of land in Bukit Timah which was to become the Raffles Town Club. This deal caused him to be sucked into one of Singapore’s longest courtroom dramas. The club’s management had admitted an excessive number of members which caused a tremendous squeeze on its facilities, prompting a lawsuit by a group of members. When I ask him about this, he grows visibly pensive. “This is a period I’d rather not talk but now that you’ve asked, I’ll tell you my understanding of the case. It all started because we overbid for the land. An authority in the property market actually said we should have bid only S$44 million. We bid S$100 million so we brought in partners to pay half the value of the bid. We couldn’t do it with our own resources. “With all these partners, the money grew too big and the loose ends were not tied up. So we ended up in court. That’s the best way I can describe it.” Eventually, in 2001, he had to sell Europa Holdings in the settlement. “The whole incident actually changed me completely. I was no more happy-go-lucky after that. Fifteen years of a life moving in and out of court is not funny. I lost some of my best friends in the process. “But you learn and you do things more carefully after something like that. At the same time, you tend to be more sensitive and aware to anticipate potential conflicts and avoid them.” After this incident, he famously declared to his wife that he “had nothing left”. But her encouragement to “build an even bigger Europa” spurred him to start Devil’s Bar and later St James Power Station in 2006. Today, as he looks at the nightlife scene in Singapore, he laments the changes in the social landscape that have impacted business. “Today, people have found other ways to connect with each other rather than in clubs. They meet on social media and dating apps, so that has shrunk the market as well. That’s why clubs today have to be smaller to be sustainable.” He mentions the closure of other mega clubs over the years such as the Butter Factory and Ministry of Sound. “I will not redo a mega club like St James because today Singapore cannot sustain multiple mega clubs, especially in one location. I might have done better if I had opened a few small ones in different locations across the island. You have to change your business model. My advice to my son is to start two or three small ones here and if you’re successful, you can duplicate it overseas. This must be the formula going forward.” “THEY CAME WITH HAND GRENADES” He himself never ventured overseas largely because of experiences that he says frightened him.  “Back in the 90s, I went to Ho Chi Minh City to do business. We opened Europa there. Members of the underworld actually came to us and asked us for money. In those days, in Vietnam, they didn’t come with knives. They came with hand grenades. After three years, the lease expired and we gave up. That frightens me from going abroad again.” He regrets having never done business in China though. “China clearly is a big market with a huge hinterland. But when I tried to go there to set up in the early 2000s, I realised that even there, if you want to get things done, you have to entertain the politicians, the people who work in government agencies. You have to give them gifts.” I remark that many businessmen see this as part and parcel of investing in certain countries and ask him why he couldn’t he accept it.  “Because they perpetually have a hold on you. I don’t like that.” SINGAPORE’S CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT He hasn’t lost hope in the Singapore market, although he feels that manpower costs could have been better managed by the authorities as the F&B industry in general is suffering the effects of such costs. “If you have a foreign worker quota, why must you also impose a levy?” I put it to him that without the levy, it is likely wages for Singaporeans working in the sector would be depressed further. While nodding, he says it also might be too late to reverse this policy. “It’s already entrenched in the system. Things like such levies and taxes support a lot of other beneficial Government initiatives for Singaporeans, so you can’t just take them away.” Instead he suggests other ways of reviving the “saturated F&B sector” which has also recently seen the closure of Michelin star restaurants such as Joel Robuchon and Restaurant Andre.  “The only way to mitigate this situation today is to increase the revenue via a higher average cheque per table at restaurants.  The only way to achieve a higher average cheque without people complaining that they are not getting value for it is to introduce another dimension of the dining experience.” He suggests cultivating a dining culture that more often includes drinking alcohol with meals, something he feels is not a part of Singapore’s culture yet. “Start cultivating people to, for example in Western restaurants, drink more wine and even at other casual eateries or hawker centres, have wine, beer or spirits to go with the meal.” He is quick to add that he doesn’t encourage drunkenness, but merely an appreciation of moderately pairing alcohol with meals to bring out the best in the food, while helping restaurants sustain their business. “It happens all over the world. In Japan you have sake, wine in Europe, rum in Jamaica. Once we do this, the best will survive.” If F&B outlets do better, he feels it will have a knock-on effect on retail outlets in the vicinity too. He also feels that more can be done to revive Orchard Road, suggesting music festivals and food trucks which also provide seating for patrons. “There’s also a lack of nightlife there. So you’ve got to build clusters that support one another. Bars, live performances and food on the street that can support the retail sector too.” \n\n\n\n\n “I STAND BY THE IDEA OF CASINOS” Among the more controversial suggestions that Mr Foo has made over the years has been that Singapore build casinos, a move that divided Singaporeans and continued to do so even after the Integrated Resorts (IRs) were opened in 2010.  As a member of the Tourism Working Group of the Economic Review Committee, he wrote a white paper on the subject in 2002. As part of the study, visited casinos in the United States and Australia. He bore the cost of his travels, including a loss of S$250,000 that he incurred while gambling in Tasmania. “It hurt to lose money, but it was a necessary part of the experience,” he says. I ask him why he felt so strongly about having casinos in Singapore and what he makes of the objections that are still heard in some quarters about the ill-effects of having them here. “Back in 2000, I said the casinos were already here in the form of cruise ships to nowhere, sucking money out of Singaporeans and someone up North openly said they built a whole port with Singaporean money. The casino ships ply our waters, but create no jobs and pay no taxes. So I said as a defensive strategy, we should create a casino here. \"Within Asia, we are also unique. We have all the pre-requisites to make it world-class. We have security, infrastructure. We are a trusted brand. We are small and we are well-regulated.\" In spite of the concerns over problem gambling, his view has not wavered. “In terms of entertainment, casinos offer excitement and all the services built around them – hotels, restaurants, retail, conventions – bring in money too. “I am aware of the social costs. I stand by the idea of casinos, but I agree the barriers need to be tighter. They charge Singaporeans S$100 per entry, but the S$2,000 annual entry levy is too cheap for unlimited entry for one year. You induce people to go there more. That is wrong.” While latest reports show Singapore's IRs making profits, he acknowledges that they continue to face stiff global competition. “IRs though transformational, are but catalysts to drive the overall tourism product. Only when the other components in the overall tourism ecosystem are really thriving then will we realized the IRs’ true potential. “Every sector must reinforce itself and support each other. In other words, for our IRs  to be competitive, complementary industries must thrive as well. Still, each IR must develop its own unique selling proposition to attract its core customers.” Several years ago, he also suggested a legalised red light district in Singapore much like the ones in Amsterdam and Hamburg. “If they go underground, it is harder to regulate. Right now, the activities are scattered. It’s not just restricted to Geylang. You see it elsewhere in Singapore too. The signals are not clear. It’s the oldest profession in the world. You can’t eradicate it. You can only accommodate it and control it. You accept the problems and create measures to monitor and tackle them.” Some might describe him as someone who would cast morality aside for a money-making idea. Others would call him a realist making the best of the situation. He is aware that opinion on such issues is split. “I know there’s a stigma attached to some ideas. But I think if we can moderate these things and allow them to be commercially viable at the same time, as they already are, but in a more organised manner, why not?” While Mr Foo says he has no concrete plans to return to the business world formally at the moment, he clearly has ideas waiting to be developed. “I am a salesman through and through. If I had not taken over my father’s business, I presume I would end up in a sales job or if my entrepreneurial spirit got the better of me, I would have set up companies that would be selling some consumer products or something. Ultimately, I want to be remembered for having contributed something to society.”  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dennis-foo-nightlife-st-james-holdings-citybar-on-the-record-10505800"}, {"datetime": "08 Jul 2018 06:25AM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "family", "parenting", "holiday", "city", "countryside"], "author": "June Yong", "title": "Commentary: A countryside holiday is therapy for a city-bred Singaporean family", "content": " SINGAPORE: During the recent June holidays, my family took off to Malaysia and explored the rainforests of Kuala Kubu Bharu. The experience surprised me and gave me a glimpse of what it could be like when they head for Outward Bound School in Secondary 3. We left for the eco-resort after meeting up with my sister-in-law’s family in Kuala Lumpur. We had done our research about the rainforest resort we were going to call home for the next few days. It boasted a rustic jungle lifestyle, along with home-cooked foods, and comfortable hut-like rooms that came with picturesque views of either the neighbouring river or the lush forests. We spared our kids from the romanticism of going back to nature as we wanted them to be mentally prepared. There would be mosquitoes, an amazing array of unidentifiable flying insects, maybe even sandflies, and no TV or wifi (meaning that we’d have to go gadget-free for the three days). We braced ourselves for complaints from our city kids, but as it turns out, they took to the experience like fish to water and far exceeded our expectations. It was as if their survival instincts, given the opportunity of finally coming into some use, kicked in. There were cuts and scrapes, bruises and bites, along with some whining about insects, but these did not seem to make a major dent in their experience. Instead my Singapore born-and-bred kids seemed to have taken much away from their forest experience. And it made me wonder how we can tap into nature-rich experiences in urban Singapore. NURTURED BY NATURE Given the pace of urbanisation, nature has come under the spotlight in recent years. Research generally supports the assertion that increasing nature and nature experiences in urban life has a positive impact on our mental health. Some studies suggest that being close to nature stimulates learning abilities and reduces the symptoms of neuro-developmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. They tout benefits such as improved attention, reduced anger and stress levels, and increased family interaction. We witnessed all of that and more over the course of just three days. DRAWING BOUNDARIES BUT ALSO LETTING GO Let’s not be idealistic though. Nature can also be terrifying, particularly for us city folks. My children are comfortable in the water but are not particularly strong swimmers. So we took the resort owner’s advice and allowed them to only explore the river’s upstream, which was gentle enough to not sweep any unsuspecting five-year-old away. The downstream area was steeper and far more rapid. My husband tried sliding down a natural rock-slide here and was shocked to be swept down so quickly by the current. Our host also warned us to pay attention to the water’s colour. In the case of rain higher up in the mountains, there can be a surge in the waters. We were instructed to get the children out of the water if the river changes from clear to murky brown. Thankfully, our four nephews had been to the resort before and were familiar with the grounds. With them as their personal guides, the kids soon found their confidence and learned how to navigate the river’s rocky terrain. They spent hours each day playing at the river, splashing around, climbing on rocks, and discovering new “toys” made up of bricks, wooden sticks and sand. It was independent child-led play in all its glory, and I found myself wondering how is it that a simple river could hold the children’s attention for so long. I admit, I was a little skeptical in the beginning, and also kiasi (afraid to die). While my sister-in-law relaxed with a book on a large boulder by the river, I stood in the river like a hawk, eyeing the woody riverbanks with a hint of paranoia, ready to spring into action at any sign of danger. As my kids waded upstream, clambering over rocks and boulders, I resisted the urge to call them back. I wanted to give them some room to play and explore but was also worried about the river’s unknown dangers. Although they were but small figures in the distance, I could still see quite clearly whenever one of them lost their footing and fell. What I witnessed on those river jaunts were heartwarming. The children collaborated by pointing out the parts of the river that were easiest to navigate. The older ones helped to guide the younger kids up and down the slippery boulders. When they started using rubber tires as floats, they also figured out how to avoid letting their tires drift away in the current. As I saw their confidence, problem-solving, and teamwork grow, I relaxed and began to enjoy the river myself. Through this, I discovered that there is a fine line between protecting our children and allowing them to experience novel experiences. While we tend to err on the side of caution, over-protecting can sometimes hinder them from taking on, and learning from, new challenges. Letting go of the reins is a scary but necessary part of our children’s growth. AWAKENED BY NATURE The transformative effects of nature were not lost on adults too. At the resort’s main tendok (a cross between a tent and a pondok, which means rough shelter), there were very little distractions, just the sound of crickets, songbirds, and the people around us. Over two and a half days, we were forced to entertain ourselves with whatever we had – board games, books, and nature – and let go of our daily habits of checking whatsapp and social media. With little to do, and no appointment to rush for, we gathered around the table and talked about the recent political resurgence in Malaysia, the kids’ education, and health matters, among other things.  As with most family discussions, there were agreements as well as disagreements. But what amazed me was how nature seemed to slow time down and open up a space for us to connect over real issues. VALUING PEOPLE AND RELATIONSHIPS In the modern world, we value efficiency and getting things done. But in all the achievement, we may have forgotten how to value people and relationships. This nature-based holiday has inspired me to want to step outside my comfort zones and build deeper relationships. What is it about the natural world that compels such feelings of collaboration and kinship, where other facets of the modern world obscure them? There are no easy answers. Perhaps it is only by retreating into the wild can we regain a sense of wonder, peace, and solidarity. If nature bears such positive effects on our well-being and promotes essential life skills in children, how we can tap into the natural assets that are already abundant in Singapore? Can we engage more of our young residents to get involved in their community gardens? Can we ensure that children with different learning needs are regularly exposed to facilitated nature-rich experiences, as a form of early intervention? We will need to explore such questions in greater detail. Meanwhile, we can all take steps to make time for nature in our everyday lives. Our children and families will likely grow stronger, not just physically, but also mentally and emotionally.

Sofia Goh is single and working in Singapore as a procurement executive. Despite their cultural and language differences, their friendship is strong: They WhatsApp and send photos to each other regularly, and she has even visited his family. When she visits Cambodia now, she is more than just a tourist – she is a welcome friend. And it all started with a “pleasant coincidence”. “There are a lot of tuk-tuk drivers in Siem Reap.  It just so happened that he was there at that time, at that place,” said Ms Goh, 25. That time when they first crossed paths was 2015, when she was teaching in Cambodia on a volunteer trip. And the place was a cafe, where she had noticed Mr Ban parked outside in the rain, getting wet. Almost on impulse, she invited him to join her and have a drink. “I guess a part of me wanted to connect even deeper with the people and the society that made up the country,” she said. “Mr Ban was someone who definitely would’ve had a lot of stories.” Thus did two strangers strike up a rather unique friendship, as featured on the programme Across Asean. (Watch the episode here.) Ms Goh’s hotel was a short 100 metres away, but Mr Ban was not to know that until she hopped on his tuk-tuk later. “I gave him US$10 (S$14) or US$20. He didn’t need the money from me, but I felt that I appreciated his time,” said Ms Goh. “So he just told me, ‘Hey, thank you so much. You know I’m saving up for a camera phone. Can you give me your contact number? I’ll send you photos once I get my phone.’” Some three months later, she received a text from him. “I was like, this guy really texted me!” she recounted. And the more they messaged each other, she added, “the more I felt level with him”. BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP For Mr Ban’s part, after their first contact, he thought that she would “forget everything” about him. “But when she got my WhatsApp message, she replied, ‘How are you? How’s your family? I’ll visit Cambodia during such and such,” said the 30-year-old. In Khmer, we say she’s a good person and open-minded. Sofia was a tourist, but she wanted to build relationships with Khmer people like me. Born into a poor family with 10 siblings, he started working in village farms from young, as his parents were unable to finance his education. When he moved to the city to drive a tuk-tuk, he started learning English. “There weren’t so many people who were literate in my area. Though I’m the son of a farmer, I felt I should study English,” he said. “At that time, wherever English was taught for free (in the city), I’d go there to study.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Still, he was always nervous to talk with foreigners. But then he met Ms Goh, and communicating with her gave him confidence. Not only have they stayed in touch, they would also meet whenever she visits Cambodia every year. “It’s nice to know a Cambodian,” she told him. “I don’t just see tour guides, I see you, and you’re working, you tell me about your family and you tell me about Cambodia. So that’s very nice.” At the beginning, however, their relationship was “very business-driven”: She would recommend his tuk-tuk services to friends visiting Siem Reap. Over time, they bonded through their mutual interest in photography as Mr Ban sent her pictures of Cambodia, his family and tourists. “I like to take photos because I like to capture different places,” he said. “I send the photos to Sofia because I want to share with her the beautiful landscapes and continue our friendship.” She called their photo correspondence a “picture diary kind of thing”, and added: \"It’s really interesting seeing how things are through his perspective and what he chooses to capture.” Mr Ban has also promised to show her the country whenever she visits. And Ms Goh has “always been curious” about Cambodia. “When I’m there with different people, I experience different things,” she said. ‘BIG STEP FORWARD’ IN FRIENDSHIP In her latest visit, in April, she got to experience the country through Mr Ban this time. He brought her to Phnom Krom, near Tonle Sap Lake, where lotus flowers were blossoming in the gardens. “In Siem Reap, this is the only place that has lotus flowers,” he told her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To usher in the Khmer New Year, he invited her to his home to celebrate with his family and visit a temple to give offerings – much to her surprise. The festival signifies the end of the harvest season. It is a time for reflection and thanksgiving as Cambodians pay respects to their ancestors and also take to the streets with water guns and pails of water to celebrate. Said Ms Goh: “It was already a treat that he brought me to the lotus garden. Being able to go to Mr Ban’s house and share the New Year, I was really excited.” He lives in a village not far from the city, with his wife Ty Navy, two young daughters and a third child on the way. And before her visit, Ms Goh went shopping for them, buying a T-shirt for Mr Ban, toys and dresses for the children and a dress for his wife from a local market. “To meet his family will be a very big step forward in our friendship,” she said. “Knowing Mr Ban is one thing, but being able to know his family is another.” She was nervous of how they would react to a stranger from a different country, but their warm hospitality not only put her at ease, it also touched her. They showed her around their home, and together they enjoyed a meal of rice, chicken and fish, which Mrs Ban had cooked. Ms Goh even did some colouring with the children. Mr Ban said: “We’re just a simple family and don’t really know how to welcome Sofia, but I’m very happy to share and do things for her.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She even met his grandmother, who was visiting them. “To be able to meet everybody brought me a lot of joy,” she said. “The Mr Ban whom I first knew was a tuk-tuk driver. He’s now, in my eyes, a father, husband and homemaker. He’s not just a tuk-tuk driver any more.” WATCH: Their unexpected friendship (Dur 3:36)  UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS During the visit, Mrs Ban saw that there was good communication between her husband and Ms Goh. She said she does not, however, feel threatened. “My husband’s friendship is a good thing, and I welcome that friendship,” she said. Other people would (be) jealous, but for me, it’s not like that … I feel proud that he’s brought a guest to our house. At the temple, Ms Goh made offerings with the family, and Mr Ban even taught her how to chew a betel nut. “Being able to share that moment with Mr Ban and his family at the temple felt very, very intimate, and it’s probably an experience that I’ll never ever forget,” she said, citing how he shared stories about their sacred traditions.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When they returned to his house for a party, however, Ms Goh got nervous as she took a while to warm up to his relatives. But they also made her feel welcome, and together they danced and ate some more. “We couldn’t communicate by words but … it wasn’t about the words any more. It was really just (about) doing this together and having fun,” she said. “Meeting his family, and being able to spend time with them and share a moment during their new year was really, really overwhelming and something I’ll never take for granted.” Cambodia, to her, feels like home, and she appreciates the personal connections she has made with its people, who are “very nice” and “heartfelt”. She knows that many others may not understand how she and Mr Ban can have a genuine friendship, but at the same time, she thinks it is not difficult to see “how great this friendship is”. “I learned a lighter insight into life from Mr Ban – that you can have fun while you’re working hard,” she said. “It kind of makes me want to be more like him. He’s very inspirational because he has a lot of stories to tell, and he’s very willing to tell. The conversation has got a lot deeper.” The series Across Asean follows five relationships spanning all 10 countries in the region.

Mr Charles Chong will be the vice-chairman of the committee, while the other three advisers will each chair a subcommittee looking into the areas of childcare and educational institutions, public transportation and active mobility, and town council and environmental issues.  Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Dr Lam said that there will be better coordination of developments in the area. “We will also look into the various specific needs of our residents such as primary one enrolment and childcare services. These are important issues that all of us face,” said Dr Lam.  “We hope that by sitting together, we can discuss a strategy to bring forward and ease some of the challenges.”  Residents at Sengkang West welcomed the new committee and said there is still room for improvement in the area.  Mr Jonathan Phua, who has an 11-month-old daughter, said he moved in last year, and noticed that there is a need to have more shelters, LRT stations and bus stops.  Echoing the sentiment is 35-year-old Lawrence Choo, who moved into the estate two years ago. He said more childcare centres need to built around the area, as it had taken him a year to find a suitable one for his two young daughters.  Plans for the new Fernvale CC were announced in June two years ago after residents raised concerns about the lack of facilities and amenities following the closure of Fernvale Point.

But when Emma turned six, her family moved out. And once the girl went to school, everything changed, lamented Mdm Chong. “Sometimes I’d go to her house, and she’d either be on the laptop or in her room doing her work. We’d just say hello and ask, ‘Had your lunch?’ That’s all,” said the 71-year-old former army staff sergeant. “I feel lonely sometimes because I’m away from them. It’s quite sad. I’ve missed her.” Not only has there been less of a connection, but also little common ground. Emma, now 15, is an eager environmentalist who has sworn off meat and is ditching single-use plastics, while her grandmother’s first thought on the issue is that reducing waste is “ma fan” (troublesome) and recycling is a waste of time. “There’s a generation gap between me and Emma. She likes … saving the Earth and all that,” admitted Mdm Chong. “But our generation doesn’t do these types of things … I’d just dump (waste) in the plastic bag and down the chute.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Having resisted any attempts to make her live a greener life, what would it take to bring them closer now? That was the challenge faced by Emma and her when they had to work together on the programme On The Red Dot, in a series about four pairs of grandmothers and teenage grandchildren hoping to bridge their generation divide. It meant confronting their different attitudes, trying to find a common goal and making discoveries about each other. (Watch the episode here.) A BIG CHALLENGE In Emma’s case, one thing she was determined to change was her grandmother’s non-green lifestyle, which is why she got Mdm Chong to embark on a zero-waste challenge together. This involved each of them having to limit their rubbish over seven days to fit into a 500-millilitre glass jar, with the teenager inspired by the zero-waste movement she has seen on YouTube. She brings a reusable lunchbox and cutlery to school, and has a recycling area set up at home, where she encourages her family to do their part. So she already sees such actions as a duty. But even broaching the topic with Mdm Chong, on the other hand, was not easy. “How can all the trash go into (the jar)? Seven days is a lot,” she said. “Why are we doing this?” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “It’s to make us conscious of how much waste we’re producing,” replied her granddaughter, who cited the eight million kilogrammes of waste produced in Singapore each day. While that figure surprised Mdm Chong, her response to Emma’s next point – that, at this rate, Singapore’s one landfill will run out of space for incinerated waste by 2035 – did not go down well with the girl. Said the senior: It’s still far away. I don’t know if I’ll still be alive … So that’s your problem, not my problem. It was a “frustrating” conversation, admitted her granddaughter. “At my every answer, she’d have a reaction to that. Trying to convince her to do it was the toughest thing I’ve ever had to do. “It made me feel quite sad that she wasn’t really bothered.” Nonetheless, her grandmother agreed to the challenge. Said Mdm Chong: “It’s a good chance for me to get closer to her. I hope I can understand what Emma wants.” RUNNING INTO A PROBLEM But the complaints began as soon as day one, when she started to cook for Emma and herself. “Every day, I throw at least three bags of waste, sometimes more than that, depending on how much I cook. All this waste inside a small 500ml container? I don’t think I can do it,” she said. When her granddaughter advised her to let the food rot, she replied: “We don’t have any (plant) around here … Throwing it into the dustbin is easier.” Pointing to her full jar, she added: “What am I going to do with this now?” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Seeing there was that much waste from making one meal, Emma admitted: “This challenge is a bit harder than I thought it would be.” But she found a solution: Singapore’s first insect farm, Insectta, where the larvae of black soldier flies are used to break down discarded food. And the next day, she took her grandmother to the farm in Margaret Drive. At first, Mdm Chong found the maggots creepy. But then she was intrigued, wondering why the food waste they were feeding on was not smelly (they eat it before it decomposes), and how long it takes to become compost (two weeks). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She also asked Insectta co-founder Ng Jia Quan, 29, why he went into this business at his “very young” age (because, he said, food waste is a “very big issue” here). And it dawned on her that food waste used to be fed to pigs when Singapore had pig farms, while the young generation are letting insects do the job now. Another thing she learnt was that the larvae can feed on okara – soya bean residue – which caught her interest because she helps out regularly at her son-in-law’s soya bean shop. “We’ve been throwing it away for at least 10 years,” she said. “If you want, you can (come) and collect it.” A GROWING REALISATION And so her gradual awakening began. When she met Emma the next day, she said: “Good thing we managed to recycle our food waste yesterday.” While her granddaughter recognised her receptiveness to the issue as a “good step forward”, there was another thing the girl wanted to do: Wean her off single-use plastics. And looking at Mdm Chong’s jar, she saw two straws. “That’s a lot of straws in such a short time,” she remarked. “Maybe you should consider using fewer straws … because they can’t be recycled.” WATCH: Can Emma convince Mdm Chong to go plastic-fee? (Dur 5:43)  As part of her action plan, she had decided to take her grandmother to Unpackt, Singapore’s first zero-waste grocery store, in Sembawang Hills Estate. That meant bringing their own containers. And when Mdm Chong bought soya sauce, she was surprised that it cost only 45 cents, as the store’s food is sold by weight, without the packaging. Emma was quick to highlight this, saying: “See, so there are the plus points of not using packaging.” Her grandmother was reminded of the past once more. She said: A shop like this is quite interesting to me. It’s like going back to the olden times, when we bought things using our own containers. Again she also asked the co-founder of the enterprise, 36-year-old Florence Tay, her reason for being in this line of work. The reply – that packaging ends up as rubbish and “what we’re leaving for the next generation isn’t wealth and health but plastic pollution for them to handle” – left her looking thoughtful. Turning to her, Emma asked if she thought the waste issue was still not her problem, to which she said: “Now I understand. A bit.” What she realised also was that young people like her granddaughter were genuinely concerned about the state of the environment. NEGLECTED, AND APPRECIATED AGAIN For Emma’s part, she made a discovery of her own after their visit. When she asked her grandmother how the zero-waste week had been so far, Mdm Chong said: “I’m happy because I got a chance to spend time with you. “That’s why I took up the challenge. We used to have time together … Nowadays, sometimes I don’t even see you.” That “really touched” the teenager, who had “no idea” that her grandmother felt neglected. “She never did voice those feelings to me,” said Emma, who tried to reciprocate by expressing happiness about Mdm Chong’s receptiveness to the challenge. “You’re putting in effort to learn, and you’re asking very good questions,” she told her. “What counts is that you’ve tried.” The week was not over, however, and on the fifth day, they went to the Love Life Carnival, which aimed to teach visitors how to live a sustainable life. Emma was hoping that her grandmother would see that “it’s not just young people who are protecting the environment, but people of all ages because it’s everyone’s responsibility”. That message sank in when Mdm Chong learnt from the exhibits that Singapore’s recycling rate was way below that of other countries – and that plastic could take 100 to 1,000 years to decompose. “Now I think the environment needs protection because there is a lot of wastage, like food waste and disposable items,” she said. Just as clear was that both of them had grown closer. And what made Emma “really proud” of her grandmother was the latter’s initiative the next day to display stainless steel straws and reusable mugs for sale at their family’s soya bean shop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When the week was up, they both also managed to fit their non-recyclable rubbish into their jars. Mdm Chong, however, had one last surprise for her granddaughter. Having noticed that the girl had been putting mainly tissue in her jar, she gave her a handkerchief to help her “cut down more” on her waste. Said Emma: “I was definitely not expecting this much enthusiasm and participation from my grandmother … This is one of the best weeks we’ve spent together. “Now that I know she wants to spend time with me, I’ll definitely make more time for her because our time on this earth is limited. So we should make the best of what we have.” Mildred and Emma are one of four pairs of grandmothers and grandchildren featured on On The Red Dot. Watch the episode here.

Who doesn’t?", "content": " SINGAPORE: Recent discourse about inequality, social mobility, higher social spending and higher taxes has generated debate in some quarters over the ideal quantum of Government transfers and social assistance, and how such funds can be disbursed effectively. Some analysts argue that low-income families should receive more social assistance with fewer conditions so that they can more successfully break out of poverty and their children can thrive to experience greater social mobility. Others suggest that what we have today is sufficient and raise the issue of whether we’re willing to deal with the trade-offs of greater social spending with fewer conditions. Among the trade-offs – higher taxes. Whatever one’s stance on the issue, few would disagree government transfers, subsidies and social assistance need to reach the right people to meet their needs and improve societal outcomes in general. Key to this is the criteria Government agencies use to determine how and how much government transfers are disbursed. WHO IS DESERVING? WHO IS NOT? When it comes to U-Save rebates and Service and Conservancy Charges rebates for instance, the quantum is based on housing type. This has been a point of contention for some including Members of Parliament who have raised the issue for discussion several times over the years. More recently, MP for Marine Parade GRC, Seah Kian Peng said in an On the Record interview that among his residents, it is an emotive issue. “I have people telling me that just because a person lives in a three-room flat, it doesn’t mean they are poor. They can actually be very wealthy and we should scrutinise more to make sure we don’t give them rebates. Likewise, if I live in a five-room or executive flat, it doesn’t mean I’m okay.” Mr Seah himself called this “nitpicking”. He believes in a “give and take” approach.  “It is always difficult in policy-making and it’s about striking the right balance. You also do not want to spend an inordinate amount of resources or time to administer some of these means tests to make it even more precise. I think the general levers they use - income and household type as a proxies work fairly accurately for most.\" If you want it to be so precise, you need to be even more intrusive. There will be outliers here and there, but for those who are in that group who actually don’t need it, what they should do is find ways to help others. This is the hope, but clearly there are no guarantees. At the other end of the spectrum are others like MP and now Senior Minister of State for Law and Health, Edwin Tong, who feel means testing should be more “detailed”. “Today, they look at your address for example and if you live in a private estate, you’re out. One may have a home that is bought in the 60s. It might be worth more now, but you can’t expect an old couple to sell their home and then live on that in a different estate, where they’re dislocated from their own friends and society.” When I put it to him that surely the Government can’t be giving finite resources to those who own million-dollar or multi-million dollar homes at the expense of those who might not be able to afford a modest home or even a meal, he conceded this argument was “fair enough”. But he presented other scenarios. “But what about those who live in private estates, but are squatting with their siblings or with a friend. They may not be paying rent but they are there on goodwill and the goodwill could end at any point. So I think we should be more granular on it, go beyond just the address, go beyond just what the income is. What about those with dependants who have health problems? Their financial burden will be heavier.” Presented with the possibility that this would mean more administrative resources being needed, he said “it’s well worth the effort” if it means getting a “fairer, better application” of “finite” funds. Opinions clearly differ on how the system can identify people with the greatest needs and make sure fewer fall through the cracks. THE IDEAL CRITERIA During last year’s Committee of Supply debate, then-Senior Minister of State for Finance Indranee Rajah said that household income remains the best measure to determine who qualifies for government social assistance schemes. She pointed out that many social assistance programmes - such as the Community Health Assist Scheme and ComCare schemes - factor gross total monthly household income or monthly household income per capita in eligibility criteria.   Those with no income are assessed on the annual value of their home. But based on this criterion, a person who lives with wealthier family members or with a big family in one house may be excluded from schemes even though he doesn’t receive monetary assistance from them.  If household income or housing type aren’t accurate gauges, what is? Some say why not just disburse to a segment we all agree needs help - like seniors. Yet, in 2014, when it was announced that pioneers would not be means-tested for benefits under the Pioneer Generation Package, some MPs and members of the public took issue with it. It had to be emphasised that the intent of the package was to honour and recognise the contributions of all pioneers in Singapore’s nation building journey, regardless of their financial status. While this has been generally accepted as a condition of a special package for a special group, questions clearly remain about how other transfers are disbursed – even when these aren’t meant to fulfil social assistance goals. This year, when it was announced that Singaporeans aged 21 and above will get a one-off SG Bonus of up to S$300 each based on their assessable income, some members of the public questioned why the wealthy should get anything all. Why not give those with lower incomes more instead? CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS TO FORMULATE A BETTER SYSTEM With any policy, there will be trade-offs. The question is what are the most acceptable trade-offs. By not being more precise with who gets more social transfers, is their impact merely being diffused? Yet there are also costs to being precise. Some analysts have pointed out that those who apply for social assistance schemes are often asked overly intrusive questions to determine their eligibility. Being more precise when it comes to means testing might, in fact, intensify this. But, once a person’s status and needs are determined, it could mean greater leeway in terms of funds to help them break out of poverty. However, can administrative costs and bureaucratic hurdles be kept sufficiently in check as well? As the conversation on inequality and social mobility continues, it seems we need to go beyond whether we are willing to pay higher taxes to fund social spending, to discuss how tax payers’ contributions can be more efficiently spent.

The VES, which was fully implemented on Sunday (Jul 1), was a factor behind the steep decline in COE premiums, experts said. \"Before the VES kicked in, some buyers could have felt that certain cars were affordable,\" said transport researcher Professor Lee Der-Horng. \"Different buyers target different price ranges. So when the vehicle you'd like to buy is being affected, certain groups of buyers will be affected and this might be a reason for the drop in COE premiums. COE premiums for small cars (Category A) fell to their lowest in more than eight years, closing at S$25,000, down from S$34,110 in the previous exercise. This was the lowest since Mar 10, 2010, when premiums were S$20,802. Prices for larger and more powerful cars in Category B also dipped to S$31,000 from S$33,900. Open category COEs, which can be used for any vehicle type but end up being used mainly for large cars, fell to S$31,001 from S$34,400. The VES measures all new cars, taxis and newly-imported used cars for levels of tailpipe pollutants they produce - namely carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particular matter. Particulate matter was only measured after Jul 1. The amount of rebate given or surcharge levied on the vehicle is determined by the worst-performing pollutant. Given that their new vehicles could face surcharges after the full VES implementation, some opted to purchase vehicles before the deadline. One of whom was Mr Lim Chai Seng, who bought a Toyota CH-R two weeks ago. \"When I visited the showroom, there was a promotion for this particular car - a discount of about 20 to 25 per cent,\" said Mr Lim. \"It was too good to pass up. If I didn't buy it then, I would have to pay extra under the VES.\" But dealers are optimistic that the crowds will now return, given that COE premiums have fallen. \"Since the COE (premiums) have fallen by close to S$10,000, the demand for cars will still be there,\" managing director of CarTimes Automobile, Mr Eddie Loo, told Channel NewsAsia. \"Certain cars are also not affected by the VES, so people will also be encouraged to enter the market.\"  \"Each time there is a price drop, we expect to see more coming into the showroom,\" said Mr Ricky Tay, managing director of RTMT Motor.  To entice them, car dealers whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to plan to put together attractive packages, in preparation for the weekend crowd. Renault is slashing prices by S$5,000. Hyundai is offering S$2,000 discounts on all models.  \"In a few months time, people would have gotten used to the VES,\" said Mr Raymond Tang, managing director of Yong Lee Seng Motor. \"If you need to use a car, you will still get a car. Since VES is there and implemented, it will be there to stay.\" In fact, there continued to be demand for cars which incur a VES surcharge, said Mr Tang, who has received more inquiries for them since news of the lower COE premiums broke. Indeed, for most buyers, the deal breaker would be COE premiums and not the VES surcharge. \"The VES situation does not affect my decision on whether to buy a car or not,\" said Mr Jeremy Lim, who is considering buying a new car instead of a secondhand one because of the drop in COE premiums. \"It is not a game changer.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/car-dealers-discounts-coe-vehicle-emissions-ves-10504828"}, {"datetime": "07 Jul 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["hotels", "waste", "recycling"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Large hotels recycling less, can manage waste better: NEA", "content": " SINGAPORE: Large hotels can do better when it comes to managing their waste, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said, indicating they still have some way to go four years after a mandatory waste reporting exercise was implemented. This comes as latest figures from the exercise revealed that large hotels - defined as those with more than 200 rooms - recycled less in 2016 compared with two years before. In 2016, their average recycling rate was 5.5 per cent, a 0.5 percentage point drop from 2014. “A large proportion of hotel waste consists of types of waste such as food, paper and plastic bottles, which can be segregated and recycled,” NEA told Channel NewsAsia in June. “Thus the NEA is of the view that the average recycling rate is low and can be improved.” The mandatory waste reporting exercise, introduced in 2014, aims to draw greater management attention to the amount of waste produced by large commercial premises like shopping malls and hotels. NEA determines how well hotels perform by tracking how much of each major type of waste is recycled compared to the total waste generated. CHALLENGES OF RECYCLING Senior tourism lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic Michael Chiam said some hotels could find it difficult to recycle due to logistical challenges. According to an NEA guidebook for hotels, recycling bins should be easily accessible to staff and guests, match the type of recyclable waste produced at that location, and be placed together with general waste bins to prevent misuse. Ideal bin locations include rooms, kitchens and housekeeping areas. The hotel should also buy its own recycling bins to be placed at the front-of-house, as those provided by the waste contractor are more appropriate for back-of-house or bin centres. These guidelines mean “more resources are needed to support the recycling initiatives”, Dr Chiam said. In addition, Dr Chiam said an effective recycling programme requires “a lot of education, especially in changing the ways people work”. “Housekeeping staff in the past may just dispose of the half-used bottles of shampoo and replace them with new ones. With the new recycling approach, they no longer need to throw away the shampoo bottles, but to replenish them,” he said, highlighting the extra workload. Dr Chiam also pointed out the additional costs involved. “Besides the direct recycling processing costs, like acquiring the machines, haulage fees and processing fees, hotels need to incur other costs to oversee the implementation of the recycling programmes,” he said. This includes the manpower costs of having staff sort out recyclables and prevent contamination, and storage costs from bin spaces to hold the waste. TURNING BOTTLES INTO APRONS But one hotel is overcoming these challenges. The Grand Hyatt near Orchard Road said it recycled 20,519kg of waste last year, though it did not reveal its recycling rate. “There are no internal challenges since we try to organise the steps and location (of recycling bins) carefully,” its stewarding manager Vijay Sivarajah told Channel NewsAsia. There are recycling bins on each level at the back of the house, including kitchens, restaurants and offices. On designated floors, there are recycling bins for housekeeping staff to sort waste that come from guest rooms. Mr Sivarajah said the hotel recycles “as many items as possible”, including aluminium cans, metals, papers and glass bottles. It also sends PET plastic bottles to be recycled into uniforms, aprons and napkins. Soaps, shampoos and other toiletries left by guests are collected and recycled into new bars that are distributed to families living in high-risk areas for hygiene-related illnesses. “However, we face the problem of recycling companies not being willing to collect waste such as vacuum packaging for meat,” Mr Sivarajah added. The manager also admitted that recycling programmes might come with high costs and investments in the short term. But in the long run, the savings are apparent. Grand Hyatt has saved S$100,000 a year by recycling its food waste. Instead of going into the bin, food waste is put in an on-site digester that converts scraps like vegetable, poultry and egg shells into organic fertilisers. This is then used for landscaping at the hotel. “Due to our waste management system, we have the advantage of reduced haulage fees and trips,” Mr Sivarajah said, pointing out that the food waste initiative has earned the hotel a S$250,000 NEA grant. CHALLENGES OF REDUCING Some hotels are also trying to reduce the amount of waste that could be recycled, although NEA’s reporting exercise showed only a slight drop in average waste produced from 2014 to 2016. According to data from the exercise, the 97 hotels that participated in 2016 produced 66,000 tonnes of waste, equivalent to the weight of two buses. This means that each room produced 4.1kg of waste a day. An industry sustainability guide published by the Green Hotelier said luxury serviced hotels that produce more than 2kg of waste per guest per day need to buck up. “A figure greater than this is excessive and illustrates poor waste management practices,” it said. “Manpower constraints and the difficulty of getting stakeholders, for example their tenants, guests and hotel staff across departments, to participate are some of the main challenges hotel operators face when trying to reduce waste,” NEA said. NO MORE PLASTIC STRAWS Still, the zero-waste movement is gaining momentum in hotels. In May, the Millennium Hotels and Resorts (MHR) group pledged to eliminate single-use plastics from all six of its Singapore hotels by June next year. Given the hotels produce an average of 67kg of plastics weekly, the move will save almost S$500,000 a year in spending on plastic products. One of MHR’s hotels, M Social, has replaced plastic straws with paper alternatives, and is using environmentally-friendly packaging, like paper boxes and wooden cutlery, for its takeaway service. The group’s Orchard Hotel and Studio M are also in the midst of replacing plastic toiletry containers with dispensers in hotel rooms. MHR's pledge follows Hilton's announcement in the same month that it will stop using plastic straws across its 23 managed hotels in Asia-Pacific by the end of this year. “More hotel operators have implemented improved waste management systems and 3R initiatives, such as going paperless and installing on-site food waste digesters, which have helped to reduce the waste generated,” NEA said. However, MHR vice-president of operations (Southeast Asia) Lee Richards acknowledged that the process was tedious. “A comprehensive analysis needs to be done, from reviewing our plastic consumption and inventory list of each hotel; the timeframe it would take to complete the existing stock; the overall costs involved if we were to replace with dispensers,” he told Channel NewsAsia. “Plastic products are almost entirely about convenience for most people and commercially convenient as these items are generally inexpensive or lower in cost compared to other materials.” When asked if he was concerned about losing guests who might prefer using their own toiletry bottles to dispensers, Mr Richards said “we believe the majority of our customers will support the initiative”. “In the long term, reducing plastic use will benefit the environment, reduce staff time and overall cost, and also show our customers we care about the environment,” he added. MORE ECO-FRIENDLY TOURISTS? Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Dr Chiam said eco-friendly hotels will benefit from tourists who might perceive them as “forward-looking brands which attempt to do their part in saving the environment”. “Some tourists are more conscious of protecting the environment, and they may make a conscious effort to choose hotels which are more eco-friendly,” he said. However, Dr Chiam suggested that corporate travellers are more likely to stay in eco-friendly hotels as compared to leisure travellers, at least for now. This is because eco-friendly companies are likely to pick like-minded hotels for their staff on business trips, he added. “These corporate travellers will over time adopt the same standards when they book hotels for their family holiday.” Globally, the trend seems to have picked up. A Booking.com sustainable travel report published in 2016 revealed that 68 per cent of 10,000 responders said they would be more likely to choose an accommodation if they knew it was eco-friendly. ROLE OF GUESTS Nevertheless, Singapore Environment Council executive director Jen Teo said the average guest has a part to play, though the onus remains on the hotel. If a hotel has proper recycling education and provides reusable utensils, for example, guests should comply with the recycling programme and not use disposables, she said. “Most guests are generally open to supporting the recycling movement provided it is not unnecessarily inconvenient,” Dr Chiam said. “The key is to make recycling programmes as seamless as possible.” Ms Teo added that hotels form a major industry in Singapore, and thus have a “big part to play” in helping the country achieve its goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. While only large hotels, which generate more waste, need to report their waste statistics to NEA, the agency said it will review if this should be extended to hotels with fewer rooms at a “later stage”. Singapore Hotel Association executive director Margaret Heng believes that more hotels will start going green. “This is because hotels are working on a holistic approach by engaging staff, suppliers and guests in their waste minimisation practices,” she said. “The pledge by MHR group is a big win for sustainability.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/large-hotels-recycling-less-can-manage-waste-better-nea-10481148"}, {"datetime": "07 Jul 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["CareShield Life", "insurance", "MOH", "hospital", "Medishield Life", "Medisave"], "author": "Tan Jin Meng", "title": "Commentary: Help with disability costs welcomed but allowing withdrawal of Medisave may not benefit all", "content": " SINGAPORE: What will you live on if you meet with severe disability? A national insurance scheme, CareShield Life, will be launched from 2020. You pay premiums and in return you get payouts for life if you are assessed to be severely disabled. Premiums for CareShield Life can be paid from Medisave. Older Singaporeans already on ElderShield will be encouraged to upgrade to CareShield Life, with cash incentives, if they sign up within two years of 2021. Additionally, Singaporeans will be allowed to withdraw monthly cash from Medisave for their severe disability needs. Those still in need of help with severe disability costs may be eligible for aid from a newly formed ElderFund. GOVERNMENT AS BACKSTOP This appears to be consistent with how the Government structures the 3M system (Medisave, Medishield Life, MediFund) in healthcare. In this system, the Government is trying to shape shared responsibilities in paying for one’s healthcare, consistent with its approach to involving individuals first, families second, and then Government as a backstop. Medisave is enforced individual savings and can be used to pay for approved purposes, including chronic illness medication, health and eldercare insurance. It can also be used to co-pay hospital charges in the deductible and co-insurance portions of MediShield Life coverage. Families can top up a family member’s Medisave or help to pay their medical fees directly. MediShield Life is essentially meant for covering catastrophic illnesses and the resulting large hospitalisation bills. Individuals will pay cash or from Medisave first before claiming from MediShield Life. Finally, MediFund will help those who do not have the means to pay for healthcare, assessed on a case-by-case basis. The Government has modelled severe disability care on this system. But severe disability support, as defined by an inability to carry out three of six activities in daily living (ADL), is much simpler and can be taken care of slightly differently. THE CASE FOR CARESHIELD CareShield Life, like MediShield Life, is an insurance scheme. Like all insurance schemes, this is a risk-sharing scheme. A simplified illustration of risk sharing versus individual risk is as follows:   Take for example, 20 persons in a population. Half will be disabled for different lengths of time before passing away. One may be disabled for one year before passing away, but another may be disabled for 12 years. If subsidised monthly nursing costs are S$1,000 a month, then lifetime disability costs will range from zero for those not disabled to S$144,000 for those who live 12 years after disability. This can be scary since you do not know who will be disabled and for how long. This is individual risk without insurance. What if each of the 20 people pay S$8,000 each into a pooled fund that promises to pay S$600 a month for life if you get disabled? That way, everyone is assured that a part of their disability costs is covered regardless of your disability state or how long you live, at the expense of a fixed payment up front. Risk-sharing is about converting all or part of an uncertainty into a certainty, spread out among all participants. DEALING WITH ADVERSE SELECTION, MORAL HAZARD In insurance, there is the issue of adverse selection. If the insurance is not mandatory, you may feel that you are healthy and will not be hit by disability. Or perhaps you are rich enough that disability costs are not a concern. So you opt out. The insurance does not get your premium and costs increase for those still in it. One way to tackle this is to make the premiums mandatory like CareShield Life. Another issue is moral hazard. This is most well-known in healthcare insurance where zero co-payment schemes may have led medical establishments to over-prescribe and people to over-consume services. This leads to higher premium costs for others who make moderate claims, or to insurers suffering losses. This is less of an issue with CareShield Life, where the claims criteria is a simplified three out of six ADLs, and the payout is in a fixed cash amount, not for services. CARESHIELD LIFE VERSUS MEDISAVE WITHDRAWALS CareShield Life can be viewed as a kind of collective saving. Every participant contributes to a pool of funds. The fund accumulates interest, and individuals can withdraw from it when they are hit with the insured event. It offers the most economically efficient route to partially supporting and sharing the severe disability needs of the population, after mitigating the two issues of adverse selection and moral hazard.  While it avoids inter-generational funding, it features intra-generational funding – within an age cohort, healthier people, who do not claim as much, effectively help out less healthy people. The Government now says that Medisave can be withdrawn for severe disability needs. Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong says that this will give people more flexibility since it is cash, and that it avoids an inter-generational subsidy, where younger tax payers pay for the care of an older generation, for example through subsidised nursing care. But this is what CareShield Life does as well. It gives cash and avoids an inter-generational subsidy. When you run out of individual savings, including in your Medisave, you may have to plan to go “cap in hand” to apply to ElderFund or MediFund, with no certainty of disbursement. The uncertainty can cause anxiety. When you share the risk with others with CareShield Life, you are reducing this uncertainty by the amount you are insured for. The lower-income to middle-income class in particular should welcome a reduction in the uncertainty about eldercare coverage. Reducing anxiety about costs is something to be desired. MORE CARESHIELD PAYOUTS INSTEAD Instead of allowing individuals to withdraw from Medisave when they are disabled, why not commit extra funds from Medisave, when most are still in the prime of working life, to additional CareShield Life premiums to get higher payouts instead? The sharing element of CareShield is to be desired, particularly for lower-income individuals, as it provides greater certainty over a potentially catastrophic end of life event. Better off individuals have more alternatives over how they meet this event. Individuals with low or precarious income, who would have difficulty coming up a regular flow of extra premiums are likely to have trouble coming up with sufficient Medisave balances to tide them through any future severe disability and would need help then. The ability to withdraw from Medisave would be of little use. Instead, the Government should help them with premiums now instead of later. The 3M system for healthcare essentially spreads responsibility for healthcare among individuals, family, the intra-generational community and the Government. In adopting a similar system for severe disability with its slightly different characteristics, the Government can tweak it to increase the intra-generational sharing responsibility of the system and simplify this new healthcare scheme.

As such, Tuaspring withdrew its application for a debt moratorium on Jul 6, according to the filing to SGX.  TIMELINE, ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF MAYBANK Seen as one of Singapore’s most successful business stories, Hyflux made the unexpected move last month to seek court protection for a reorganisation of its business and liabilities.  The household name, which first made its mark in water treatment and later ventured into power generation, cited “prolonged weakness” in the local power market for the turnabout in fortunes.  On Jun 19, Hyflux and four of its subsidiaries – Hydrochem, Hyflux Engineering, Hyflux Membrane Manufacturing and Hyflux Innovation Centre – were granted an additional six-month reprieve from creditors by the High Court. Tuaspring was excluded as it obtained leave to discontinue its application and pursued a separate one under Section 210(10) of the Companies Act.  This application for a debt moratorium was originally scheduled to be heard at the Supreme Court on Friday at 2.30pm, but was cancelled. In the Friday announcement, Hyflux said Maybank had provided Tuaspring with banking facilities that are secured by various collaterals and securities over the unit’s properties and assets, including the Tuaspring plant.  Moving forward, the embattled water treatment firm said it will continue to seek potential investors with a view to divesting its interest in the Tuaspring project, which cost more than S$1 billion to build and marked Hyflux’s misstep into the electricity market.  To do so, it is to “execute a binding agreement with a successful bidder or investor by Oct 15, 2018, obtain approval for the transaction from Maybank, the Public Utilities Board and/or the Singapore High Court (if necessary) by Dec 11, 2018, and obtain the approval of the shareholders by Feb 4, 2019”.  The statement added that Maybank will be “actively involved and engaged” in the divestment process. In particular, a valuer will be appointed by Maybank to conduct a valuation exercise of the Tuaspring plant.  Tuaspring will also appoint a monitoring accountant and special accountant to monitor its cash flow and to review the divestment process, respectively. The reports are to be shared with Maybank, the statement said.  The Tuaspring plant is the single largest asset on the balance sheet of Hyflux Group. Losses over the years have made it the “noose” around the company’s neck, according to analysts who have said that a divestment of the plant will help to solve Hyflux’s cash crunch. Last year, Tuaspring registered a net loss of S$81.9 million, dragging Hyflux down and contributing to the water treatment firm's first annual loss since listing in 2001.As of April 30, 2018, its total liabilities amounted to S$537 million. Since putting it up for sale in early-2017, the company has insisted on getting no less than book value for the plant. A Jun 14 affidavit by Hyflux founder-CEO Olivia Lum said the company is in discussions with four parties on a possible sale of the integrated plant.  Reiterating its intention to divest its interests in Tuaspring, Hyflux’s statement said this will be done at the “best possible value in order to facilitate the Hyflux Group’s wider reorganisation process, and maximise value for all stakeholders, including holders of its preference shares and perpetual securities”. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-reaches-agreement-with-creditor-maybank-over-tuaspring-10506222"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 07:23PM", "tags": ["court", "harassment"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "OG founder's grandson in court for allegedly harassing lover's husband", "content": " SINGAPORE: The grandson of the founder of department store OG was taken to court on Friday (Jul 6) for allegedly harassing his lover's husband.

Liu also allegedly sent photographs and made two telephone calls to Mr Tay, who was the husband of his lover, between June 2016 and January 2017. Mr Tay heard that his wife, Madam Lim, was having an affair with Liu in 2016 when Liu's own wife contacted him. Mr Tay, who works in the civil service, hired a private investigator to check on his wife, who denied that she was cheating on him. She then asked Mr Tay to create a chat group with both couples to address the matter. He created a group called \"Confessions of Marco Polo\". Liu allegedly sent messages to that group that Mr Tay said constituted harassment, including a photo of Liu.

Members of the public and seven functional groups - business and industry, labour, the professions, social service organisations, the civic and people sector, tertiary education institutions, and media, arts and sports organisations - are able to make submissions for the role. Only names of people who qualify for appointment will be submitted to the eight-member Special Select Committee of Parliament for consideration, after which the recommendation will be submitted to the President for appointment. The committee is chaired by Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin and comprises MPs Chee Hong Tat, Grace Fu, Koh Poh Koon, Sylvia Lim, Josephine Teo, Vikram Nair and Lawrence Wong. But apart from the Labour Movement, who announced its nomination of veteran union leader Arasu Duraisamy for the position on Jun 29, coordinators of the other six functional groups did not reveal the names of their nominees. According to information from the Parliament website, each functional group can propose up to two people for the role. The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has recommended two NMP candidates for the business and industry functional group, SBF chairman SS Teo told Channel NewsAsia. “The nominees are selected based on their notable contributions to the field of business and industry, and that they qualify for appointment under the Constitution.” As for the professions functional group, nominations were coordinated by the Academy of Medicine, Singapore (AMS). AMS master S R E Sayampanathan said it received a total of nine nominations, two of which were shortlisted and subsequently submitted to Parliament. The People’s Association said there are a total of four nominees for the civic and people sector. “They are established in their professional fields, have distinguished themselves in their social and community services and would ensure a greater diversity of voices in the House as they contribute independent and non-partisan views in Parliament,” it said. WHO ELSE HAS LIKELY SUBMITTED THEIR NAME?  At an open town hall last month, the arts community introduced two potential candidates to become their NMP: School of the Arts lecturer Felicia Low, and Woon Tien Wei, a visual artist who founded social enterprise Post-Museum.  Channel NewsAsia understands that both parties submitted their applications to the National Arts Council (NAC) on Thursday. In a statement, NAC said it has submitted all eligible applications to Parliament, and it looks forward to working with the appointed arts NMP, if one is selected.

Current NMPs Azmoon Ahmad and Kuik Shiao-Yin had earlier indicated that they would step down from their roles. Current Labour NMP K Thanaletchimi is also preparing to step down in September.  The NMP scheme was introduced in 1990 to provide alternative voices in Parliament. The Office of the Clerk of Parliament said nominees should have rendered distinguished public service, brought honour to Singapore, or have distinguished themselves in their respective field.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nmp-nominations-48-proposal-forms-received-by-parliament-10506154"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 06:17PM", "tags": ["REDAS", "property"], "author": "", "title": "No rationale for new housing curbs, additional harsh measures on developers: REDAS", "content": " SINGAPORE: There is no rationale for the new housing curbs given that the Singapore property market \"is in the early stages of a recovery and the recovery is in line with economic fundamentals\", said the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) on Friday (Jul 6). The statement from the industry body came a day after the Government announced new property cooling measures. Among the curbs are a 5 percentage point hike in Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying second and subsequent homes, as well as a 5 percentage point tightening for loan-to-value limits for all housing loans granted by financial institutions. Analysts have described the measures as heavy-handed. REDAS said that the property market only started to see improved sentiments in 2017 on the back of brighter forecasts for the Singapore’s economy which expanded 3.5 per cent by the end of 2017 and 4.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2018.  It added that sale transaction volume is not high and within market expectation given that the property market has been in the doldrums since 2013. “The existing sizable ABSD (Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty) and TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio) remain a restraining factor for foreign buyers and Singaporeans. Buyers are still price-sensitive,” REDAS said. The organisation is of the view that the property market “should be allowed time to find its own course and reach a sustained equilibrium”. REDAS also said it does not does not see the rationale of imposing additional measures on developers. “As is, in the purchase of sites from the GLS (Government Land Sales) programme or private collective sites to replenish their land bank to keep operations going, developers are constrained by a confluence of financial considerations as well as tough and unfriendly business policies including the existing ABSD on developers and the Qualifying Certificate (QC) punitive conditions on majority of developers (who are deemed foreign companies). \"It is in the interest of the country to have a vibrant real estate industry and a steady growth in real estate value for home owners and investors in the long term,\" REDAS said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-rationale-for-new-housing-curbs-additional-harsh-measures-on-10505834"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 05:44PM", "tags": ["health"], "author": "Cheryl Goh", "title": "Artificial Intelligence platform launched to help doctors crunch patient data, make better diagnoses", "content": " SINGAPORE: Imagine stepping into a hospital outpatient clinic or polyclinic and skipping the long wait, just by looking into a camera. It is a facial recognition device which is able to match a patient to his or her medical and personal data. There is no manual registration or paperwork to be done. A text message will tell the patient which consultation room to head to, and the medical bill could even be sent directly to the patient’s home or email address.  This could soon become a reality at hospitals under the National University Health System (NUHS), with an artificial intelligence healthcare system called Discovery AI which incorporates different AI tools to make sense of the huge amount of hospital data.  Launched at the NUHS Healthcare AI Datathon and Expo on Friday (Jul 6), Discovery AI has been test-bedded at the National University Hospital (NUH). The system is expected to be deployed in phases in the coming years, across NUHS institutions including NUH and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital. “A lot of time is needed to pull out patient data, collate it, review it, and then decide what to do. With artificial intelligence, we can have tools which can be automated to pull out and collate data and present them in ways which make it much easier for health professionals to make decisions for patients,\" said Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, who is executive director at the Ministry of Health’s Office for Healthcare Transformation.  \"What this means, of course, is that health professionals will have more time on direct patient care.\" Another use for the raw data that Discovery AI processes is through a Command Centre – an intricate map of patient data that gives doctors an overview of every single patient in a hospital.  Each patient is represented by a concentric circle, which contains information such as a patient's age, medical condition, medication, length of stay, ward class and even a breakdown of hospital fees. Doctors just need to pull up the patient’s circle to gain instant access to the data.  It is so powerful it can even predict the probability of a patient being re-admitted. This means doctors can follow up more closely to prevent it from happening, and help them make better decisions. “Discovery AI is a production level sandbox to build and implement AI tools for healthcare. So it addresses the issue of privacy of the patients’ data, security that’s required to use the data in a fair and equitable way, and it gives hospital administrators and leaders an oversight of how the data is going to be used throughout the healthcare continuum,” said Dr Ngiam Kee Yuan, NUHS' group chief technology officer.  But doctors have also pointed to the one crucial thing that AI cannot replace – the human touch.  \"It makes us better, more efficient, more precise. I must emphasise that none of the tools that we build are to replace doctors, they are all to help us become better at what we do to improve the accuracy of doctors making diagnoses,\" said Dr Ngiam. Prof Tan added: “Many patients like the personal touch with their care providers, patients expressed a preference for artificial intelligence to be used to augment their care teams as opposed to replacing them.  \"So in the future, I think we will see artificial intelligence replacing some of the more tedious, repetitive tasks that health professionals need to do, and allow them to have more time to have more personal and face to face interaction with patients.\"   Another state-of-the-art AI technology that could soon make its way into local hospitals is a contactless vital signs monitor, which reads a patient's heart rate and blood pressure remotely. This device will save nurses time when making their rounds. It can even monitor a patient during his sleep, without the need to wake him. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/artificial-intelligence-platform-launched-to-help-doctors-crunch-10505634"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 04:12PM", "tags": ["Manpower", "Zaqy Mohamad", "Low-income workers"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Wage top-up scheme for low-income workers to undergo review", "content": " SINGAPORE: A Government scheme to boost the salaries of low-income workers will undergo a review, with many previous recipients no longer qualifying for wage top-ups as their incomes had grown.  The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is reviewed every three years, with the last in 2016.

The court heard that she received more than S$130,000 in bribes from Leonard Glenn Francis, the Malaysian CEO of maritime services company Glenn Defense Marine (Asia) (GDMA), in exchange for sensitive US Navy information.  Gursharan committed the offences while she was a former lead contract specialist with the US Navy and based in Singapore. Before she resigned in 2015, she had been an employee of the US Government for more than 25 years. Her role with the US Navy included managing ship husbanding contracts worth millions of dollars, with duties such as drafting contract requirements, as well as negotiating and evaluating bids. The bribes she received from Francis included S$100,000 in cash for a condominium apartment down payment and a Prudential policy.  She also accepted more than S$30,000 worth of stays in luxury hotels like Ritz-Carlton in Bali and Dubai, as well as the Shangri-La Hotel in Jakarta. Francis, nicknamed Fat Leonard, is in custody in the US and faces a maximum custodial term of 25 years for defrauding the navy of more than US$35 million (S$48 million).  The scandal has also resulted in the arrest and conviction of several navy officials in the US. Between 2006 and 2013, Gursharan disclosed non-public information from the US Navy to Francis, which helped GDMA clinch 11 contracts worth a total of about US$48 million, out of 14 contracts that the company bid for. The information she provided included pricing strategies, price information of GDMA's competitors and questions that the contracts review board had posed to GDMA's competitors, according to investigations by Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) The fraud was uncovered after GDMA became the focus of investigations in the US in 2012. HIGH LEVEL OF PREMEDITATION, LARGE GRATIFICATION SUMS Sentencing Gursharan to jail for three charges of corruption and one charge of dealing with benefits of criminal conduct, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said there was \"flagrant abuse of trust and authority\" by Gursharan.  There was also \"a high level of premeditation\", with steps taken to avoid detection, a sustained period of offending of seven years and a \"high amount of gratification\" by the accused.  Responding to defence lawyer Suresh Damodara's point that Gursharan was in remission from cancer and that prison was a high-stress environment that may cause a relapse, the judge said that Gursharan is not currently suffering from terminal illness and that she would be provided medical care while incarcerated. The judge disagreed with the prosecution's point that the incident could cause a loss of confidence in Singapore's public administration, saying that the transactions were for private contracts, albeit involving the US Navy. He also ordered that the S$130,278.34 surrendered by Gursharan to the CPIB to be forfeited to the anti-corruption agency. For her corruption charges, Gursharan could have been jailed for up to five years and fined up to S$100,000. For acquiring, possessing, using, concealing or transferring benefits of criminal conduct, she could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to S$500,000.  OTHER US NAVY PERSONNEL HAULED UP TO COURT The other people involved in the broader fraud and bribery investigations have been charged or sentenced. Francis, who pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentence in the US, has agreed to forfeit US$35 million in personal assets. He had also bribed other US Navy personnel in order to secure lucrative ship-husbanding contracts to supply US Navy vessels at ports in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

These are some of the responses this family have received in the past fortnight. And the Hengs are touched by the generosity shown, as well as a tad upset by the criticisms, since the publication of CNA Insider’s story and video about them raising seven children on a monthly income of less than S$3,000. The Hengs, one of Singapore’s rare big families nowadays when couples are having fewer children, were featured initially on the programme On The Red Dot. And the financial, logistical and parenting challenges faced by the family struck a chord with readers and viewers online, who wrote in offering items like toys, books, and bicycles as well as food vouchers and help with groceries. In response, dad and sole breadwinner David Heng, 42, said: “These can all be useful in many ways. But what I value most is the heart behind the offers.” WATCH: Life in the Heng household (4:58)  STUNG BY COMMENTS AT FIRST Appreciative as he is now, however, he admitted that he was “disturbed and hurt” at first by the negative reactions on social media. The main issues raised included the question of whether having a large family is unfair to the children if affordability is a struggle and whether it is irresponsible to fall back on state assistance. The Hengs receive help under schemes such as the Education Ministry’s Financial Assistance Scheme and the Health Ministry’s Community Health Assist Scheme, as well as from the Social Service Office for things like their service and conservancy charges. Now that he has “calmed down” since the initial sting of some of the comments, Mr Heng wonders: “Has anyone never needed help? Help can come in many forms.” And it’s an opportunity to teach my children never to forget to pay it forward. His wife and stay-at-home mum Esther added that the family does not depend on such help for their daily expenses, which her husband still pays for, “but since there’s financial assistance, we can make good use of it”. “What goes around comes around. My children are young now. In the end, when you grow old in Singapore, you may need assistance too,” said the 40-year-old. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n FINANCES AREN’T EVERYTHING The couple do not think their children are being short-changed either. Mrs Heng has asked them, for example, whether they wanted to have tuition at the Chinese Development Assistance Council, “but they weren’t keen”. They may not go to “exotic” places overseas, but they enjoy holidays in Malaysia, which sometimes her parents treat them to, she said. “We don’t ask (my parents), but they choose to help us.” Mr Heng cited his social work with children who have done well “without a strong financial background”, and he added: “Physical resources contribute a percentage of how they turn out, but what’s more important is the non-material input.” While their children may be more mature than their peers and have more sibling responsibilities, Mr Heng does not think this is a bad thing. His wife added: When it comes to changing diapers, bathing them and taking them to the playground, I’d always do it. What Mr Heng has realised is that “time is the biggest commodity”, which is why he just started a new job as a church executive, freeing up his evenings and weekends to spend with his children, unlike before. He took four months to decide on leaving his previous job at a children’s home, which he “loved”, before he tendered and told his family. FROM A SCOOTER TO A MEAL Even as the couple say they do more to provide for their children than what others saw or read about, they have already received messages of support. Mr Heng subscribes to the point made in the commentary “Raising 7 children on S$3,000 a month in Singapore, and a tale of constructive parenting” that big families benefit from practising values like saving on food and necessities. “My children understand the values of delayed gratification and of gratitude,” he said. This is one of the reasons that Gardenia gave the family a hamper, loaves of bread and an assortment of cream rolls and buns this week. “Mr and Mrs Heng have instilled family values of trust, responsibility and love in their children, and we're very touched when we can see a loving, big family,” said Gardenia Foods marketing manager Carrie Tan. “We hope that our little gesture can bring some joy to the children.” One member of the public, who wanted to remain anonymous, contacted CNA to offer the Hengs a scooter and some toys because their story “resonated” with her as the youngest of seven siblings in her family.

This dragged down the benchmark Straits Times Index, which fell 2 per cent to close Friday at 3,191.82. This is the lowest since May 1 last year, which the index closed at 3,175.44. Year-to-date, the index has fallen 6.2 per cent. Aimed at cooling the property market and keeping price increases “in line with economic fundamentals\", the Government announced a rise in the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates and tightening of loan-to-value (LTV) limits on residential property purchases.  The new rates, which take effect today, come a day after the central bank noted “euphoria” in the property market.  Among the developers, City Developments Limited slumped as much as 17.8 per cent to S$9.22 - its lowest since February last year - before closing the day down 15.6 per cent at S$9.46. UOL Group fell 13.5 per cent to end the day at S$6.70, its lowest close since March last year. CapitaLand, Singapore’s largest developer, dropped 6 per cent to S$2.99, the lowest since December 2016. Wing Tai slumped 6.9 per cent to end the day at S$1.89 - the lowest since May last year - after falling as much as 9.9 per cent intraday. Among the small-caps, Oxley Holdings tumbled 15.9 per cent to S$0.345, while APAC Realty plunged 25.6 per cent to a record low of S$0.58.  Propnex, which soared 22 per cent on its trading debut on Monday, plummeted 24.6 per cent to S$0.52.  Since the tweaking of housing curbs last March, local property shares have seen their outlook brightened on the back of a pick-up in buyer sentiment and prices, which was later accompanied by a surge in collective sales.  Given the upbeat market conditions, market watchers have been positive on the sector, with developers among their top picks for most of the year. But with the surprise move from the Government, analysts have begun downgrading their ratings for the sector.  OCBC Investment Research analyst Andy Wong, for one, has cut the local residential sector to a neutral stance, from overweight, and will be reviewing recommendations of developers under its coverage.  “While we previously argued that the positive outlook presented a buying opportunity in the midst of the sector correction, we no longer believe this to be the case,” he wrote in a note.  Describing the new measures as using a “sledgehammer to kill a fly”, Mr Wong added that these were not in the research house’s base case scenario given that private residential prices have only started to increase by less than 10 per cent since the trough in the second quarter of 2017.  Meanwhile, the smaller rate of quarter-on-quarter increase in the second quarter appeared to have dispelled concerns about a tighter regulatory environment.  Coupled with current macro uncertainties, near-term sentiment for local property shares will likely be soured, noted Mr Wong.  Echoing that, DBS analysts Derek Tan, Rachel Tan and Carmen Tay have turned underweight on local developer stocks and are pencilling in a potential 20 per cent downside in share prices.  They expect the combined impact of the new measures to raise the cost of home ownership and consequently, cool demand from investors and foreigners in the immediate term.  “In terms of sales momentum, we expect total volumes to fall to 9,000 to 10,000 units in 2018, and potentially even further if these curbs remain,\" they said. The current en bloc cycle is also likely to come to an end as developers recalibrate their strategies to clear unsold stock at high prices, DBS analysts added.  RHB Research analyst Vijay Natarajan also described the fresh cooling measures as a \"killer move\" that will trigger a knee-jerk reaction in property stocks.  Expecting share prices to see a 5 to 10 per cent correction, he is looking to review his current overweight call on the sector and stock recommendations.  \"We believe this will have bigger impact on high-end projects. Transaction volumes and prices overall are expected to see a slowdown as a result. We are of the view that developers holding large unsold Singapore residential landbank will see a bigger impact,\" he wrote in a morning note.   \"For property agencies, the impact from a transaction volume slowdown is likely to be partially mitigated by possible increases in developer commissions. This is due to their need to sell units within the 5-year deadline.\"  BANKS HIT BUT LONG-TERM VIEW STILL POSITIVE The tightening moves could also deal local lenders a blow though the longer-term view of the sector remains positive, according to RHB Research analyst Leng Seng Choon.  All three lenders fell on Friday. DBS lost 2.6 per cent to close at a six-month low of S$25.35; United Overseas Bank dropped 3.1 per cent to S$26.26, and OCBC tumbled 2.3 per cent to a 9-month low S$11.24.   “The measures are expected to dampen demand for residential property, particularly investment properties. Among the three banks, UOB has the highest exposure to housing loans, at 27.6 per cent of its total loans – hence, UOB’s share price may be impacted more negatively in the short term,” wrote Mr Leng, who reiterated his neutral call on the sector. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/property-stocks-slump-absd-new-cooling-measures-10503986"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 08:12AM", "tags": ["property", "cooling measures", "ABSD", "housing loans"], "author": "Alison Jenner", "title": "New housing curbs expected, but extent of measures ‘heavy-handed’: Analysts", "content": " SINGAPORE: The new property cooling measures announced on Thursday (Jul 5) were not entirely unexpected given the recent euphoria in the housing market, but the speed and timing at which the measures were introduced as well as the extent of the curbs were “heavy-handed”, some analysts told Channel NewsAsia. Among the curbs are a 5 percentage point hike in Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying second and subsequent homes, as well as a 5 percentage point tightening for loan-to-value limits for all housing loans granted by financial institutions . The measures - which the Government said were made to cool the property market and keep price increases in line with economic fundamentals - are expected to have the largest impact on the en bloc market as well as the private residential market, the analysts said. “The Government has been keeping a watchful eye on the market for some time, with the slew of en bloc sales, record breaking land prices and strong residential price recovery with some new launches at record prices. So the measures were not unexpected,” said Ms Ong Choon Fah, CEO, research and consulting at Edmund Tie & Company.  Multiple rounds of cooling measures were introduced between 2009 and 2013 to rein in the market, although some curbs – including the seller’s stamp duty holding period and rates – were eased in March last year. This helped to curb prices, which went on a decline for nearly four years, although they started rising again in the third quarter of last year. Official data released on Monday showed that private home prices jumped by 9.1 per cent year-on-year in the April-to-June period, with analysts predicting that prices could soon recover to 2013 peak levels. Two days later, Mr Ravi Menon, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) called for the need for caution amid the “euphoria” in the market.  “After yesterday’s remarks from MAS’s Mr Menon, we sort of expected that the Government may step in; but did not expect it to be so immediate,\" said Mr Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty Network.  \"After all, it was a warning for buyers to be cautious and not overstretch and many thought the Government would let market forces dictate the pace for the time being,”  He added: “However, the Government may have brought this forward as they are expecting things to worsen should the US-China trade war gathers pace (impact on Singapore’s economy) and also interest rate increases over time.\" 'DRACONIAN AND HEAVY-HANDED' Some analysts have lamented the timing and extent of the measures, saying that the curbs came just as launch and sale activities were starting to pick up. They also said that the market would have adjusted and found its equilibrium even without the new curbs. \"It has caught many by surprise because there have been signs that higher prices have lowered affordability and slower take-up rates for some new launches,\" said Ms Christine Li, senior director of research at Cushman & Wakefield Singapore. \"The Government could have waited for further indicators to assess the market before pushing out another round of cooling measures,\" she added. Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of ZACD Group, added that he felt the measures were \"heavy-handed\" and \"draconian\". \"This round of cooling measures is heavy handed ... Introducing these draconian measures when the residential property market is barely into its first year of recovery is like strangle the baby in the cradle,\" Mr Mak said. \"If there is no Government interference, the market will adjust to find its equilibrium. However, this new round of curbs will reduce home buying demand, especially among investors.\" He added: \"As developers have a five-year deadline for their projects, they cannot hold back the launch of their projects for too long. Hence, this round of cooling measures could even hasten the market oversupply.\" Mr Ku Swee Yong, CEO of International Property Advisor (IPA), said as well that he thought the extent of the measures were \"heavy-handed\". \"We thought that stamp duties could maybe increase by 2 per cent. We didn’t know that it would be 5 per cent across the board plus 5 per cent on developers and then on top of that 5 per cent reduction in borrowing,\" he said. \"You are not only making it more expensive to buy, you are also making it tougher for the borrower,\" he added. DEVELOPERS AMONG THE HARDEST HIT The measures are expected to hit developers, collective sales and buyers of second homes the hardest. Singaporeans buying a second home will now pay ABSD of 12 per cent instead of 7 per cent previously, and 15 per cent for their third and subsequent properties. Stamp duty for Singaporeans and permanent residents buying their first homes remain unchanged. With ABSD increased by 5 percentage points for foreigners as well, the revised duty of 20 per cent could make them reassess the viability of buying Singapore properties, said Mr Tan Tee Khoon, executive director and head of residential project marketing at Knight Frank. The additional 5 per cent ABSD introduced for developers buying residential properties for development could raise the cost of land acquisition, reduce the bullishness of tender bids and deflate the en bloc sale market further, analysts said. This means developers will have to pay upfront an ABSD of 5 per cent, which cannot be remitted, when they purchase en bloc properties for redevelopment. \"The direct implication will therefore be on the purchase price of these en bloc properties. Developers will have to factor in the higher acquisition costs and are therefore likely to offer lower prices for en bloc purchases,\" said ERA's Mr Lim. Singapore has seen a flurry of en bloc deals recently; last year, 37 en bloc tenders worth more than S$8.7 billion were awarded. The largest collective sale this year was Pacific Mansion at River Valley Close, which sold for S$980 million. On Wednesday, Horizon Towers at Leonie Hill was launched for sale, with the owners setting a reserve price of S$1.1 billion. \"The en bloc windfall won't be such a large windfall anymore,\" said IPA's Mr Ku. \"I’m just hoping that those en blocs that were previously announced and committed will not be broken ... I hope the developers won't back out of it.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/housing-curbs-absd-ltv-expected-but-heavy-handed-analysts-10503276"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 06:35AM", "tags": ["Navy", "defence"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Meet the Navy’s new ‘mothership’ that fights with unmanned drones and vessels", "content": " SINGAPORE: Not long ago, a warship’s superiority was defined by how powerful the guns on its deck were. Then, as weapons evolved, how far its missiles could go. Now, with wars increasingly being fought hundreds of kilometres apart, it has become a case of spotting the enemy before it spots you. “We are reaching a stage where who sees first, who sees fastest, actually wins,” Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) head of naval operations Cheong Kwok Chien told Channel NewsAsia in an exclusive interview on Saturday (Jun 30). And so the RSN saw an opportunity for change. The Victory-class missile corvettes, for over two decades the “backbone” of the RSN’s strike capabilities, are entering their twilight years. They will hit the end of their operational life in 2025. Enter the multi-role combat vessel (MRCV), a type of “mothership” that will work in tandem with unmanned machines to see farther and respond quicker. These mission-configurable warships will be introduced after 2020. “If we have certain areas we want to watch closely, we can be triggered early to respond,” Rear-Admiral (RADM) Cheong said. “These ships allow us to put eyes forward.” These “eyes” are actually a network of unmanned drones and vessels that respectively carry cameras and weapons. “The suite of weapons and sensors that can spread itself over a large area effectively turns the ship from being a point source to an area type of umbrella capability,” RADM Cheong added. A typical strike package will possibly comprise a pair of MRCVs that each carries three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), so there’s one in the air at all times, and two unmanned surface vessels. But the RSN has not laid down specific configurations. There are physical limits to how much the MRCV can carry, and then there’s the cost factor of buying too many unmanned systems. “Technology is allowing unmanned systems to get smaller, and it helps,” RADM Cheong said. “But there are physical limits to size because out there the wind is quite strong, so you can’t fly a typical hobbyist drone.” Still, he added that the MRCV will allow the RSN to “bring a CCTV out to sea”. “If you have a whole network of eyes and shooters, you really expand the effective influence of the vessel.” ALL-ROUND VIEW  While current UAVs can extend a ship’s field of vision by 100km because of their range, RADM Cheong said it’s likely that those on the MRCV can go farther. “In the future, this range will increase because the control capabilities will improve,” he added. “It’s not very far-fetched to say that easily the ship will have awareness of maybe 150km around it.” The high-definition capability of the UAV’s camera also adds a whole new dimension to surveillance, far beyond beeping blips on traditional radars. “You can see the colour of the hair of the guy you’re looking at 150km away; that’s possible,” RADM Cheong said. It doesn’t stop there. The RSN wants to hear and recognise him as well. “The other breakthrough that we will go for is to be able to see different dimensions,” he added. “If you put together facial recognition, voice recognition and sense recognition, not many people can run away from that.” With information from multiple UAVs and cameras, as well as intelligence from other assets, the RSN intends to put it all together on a single screen.  “More than flying cameras around, it’s quite important for us to stitch together the picture and make sense of it fast,” RADM Cheong said. “No point staring out at beautiful scenery without knowing what you’re looking for.” “This technology is not earth-shattering,” he continued. “It just takes deliberate effort to make it happen.” Beyond its superior strike and surveillance capabilities, the MRCV is also more versatile and can go farther than the missile corvette, which was purpose-built for its warfighting capabilities. For example, the MRCV can undertake counter-terrorism as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) missions, because it can carry mission-specific cargo like counter-terrorism forces and medical aid. JOINT MULTI MISSION SHIP But the RSN’s ship of choice when it comes to HADR is the landing ship tank (LST), which has been deployed at several humanitarian assistance operations including the Aceh tsunami in 2004. This is because the 141m-long, 6,000-tonne LST is the RSN’s largest ship, with the capacity to carry up to 18 tanks, 20 vehicles and bulk cargo. It also has two 25-foot deck cranes for loading and unloading of cargo. But the RSN wants to go bigger. “What we have learnt from a lot of disaster relief missions is that our first wave of aid and supplies that go in really make the difference,” RADM Cheong said. “It’s not about building a conveyor belt, the first guy who reaches there, the first box that you open must save lives. That’s why we need to carry more.” With that, the RSN will replace the LST with a larger joint multi mission ship (JMMS) that can carry twice the amount of cargo and discharge it better. The JMMS will also be introduced after 2020. “When you reach the area, you must always remember that there’s no beautiful port for you to come alongside and put the staircase down,” he added. “So, the design of the ship is also how you can bring it to an area with no access.” This extra space and accessibility are also important during counter-piracy operations. In the Gulf of Aden, Singapore regularly deploys the LST for international anti-piracy patrols. To that end, the JMMS will be able to carry more and bigger boats to transport boarding teams that repel pirates and keep merchant ships safe. “When the sea is rough, and the boat you carry is so small, you can’t launch your boys and say please carry on,” said RADM Cheong, who has led counter-piracy operations at the Gulf of Aden. “Even for a big ship which can carry three to four boats, it’s never enough. It’s always the feeling that you want to do more than what you have brought along.” Besides boats, the JMMS can also carry larger UAVs and unmanned vessels to do surveillance and fend off pirates. Its longer flight deck also means it can carry multiple helicopters, as opposed to the LST which could only carry two. As RADM Cheong concluded: “It’s more than just a pick-up lorry.” BETTER AND SHARPER Along with the Type 218SG submarine, RADM Cheong said the RSN’s three new vessels bode well for Singapore’s future. “We have built in a confidence and belief in the younger generation to see that with each generation, we modernise the Navy to make it better and sharper,” he said.  Each acquisition is “very deliberate”, he added, with a lot of hard work going into designing, operating and maximising it. “We are always maximising limited resources, and we never back off from any challenge.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/navy-new-mothership-that-fights-with-unmanned-drones-vessels-10502774"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["Trade war", "Trade tensions", "Singapore economy"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "With the world ‘moving a little closer’ to a trade war, what’s the impact on Singapore?", "content": " SINGAPORE: As trade friction between the United States and China heats up with mutually-threatened tariffs kicking in on Friday (Jul 6), the world seems to be “moving a little closer” to an all-out trade war – a scenario that will weigh on Singapore’s economy, economists said.  While united in the view that a global trade war, if it happens, will have an impact on Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP), experts differed on the extent of the damage. For instance, estimates of downside risk to growth this year ranged from 0.2 percentage points to 0.8 percentage points. The 25 per cent tariff levied by the US on US$34 billion (S$46 billion) worth of Chinese products across 818 categories is set to take effect just after Friday midday in China. Beijing has said that it will respond the instant these measures kick in with tariffs on the same value of US goods, including vehicles and agricultural products.  The Trump administration is also preparing to target a second tranche of Chinese goods valued at US$16 billion once it completes further reviews.  All these come on top of the already-imposed US tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminium imports from all major trading partners, as well as further threats of extra 10 per cent duties on an additional US$200 billion worth of Chinese products.  Economists are particularly worried about the potential retaliation to the latter, which could cause the ongoing trade spat to evolve into a full-blown trade war.  “We believe China is likely to retaliate, having warned of strong countermeasures,” said Schroders’ emerging markets economist Craig Botham.  “(The 10 per cent tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods) marks a significant intensification of hostilities and a more substantial macroeconomic impact, with total targeted Chinese trade now 10 per cent of Chinese exports.”  Echoing that, Oxford Economics’ lead Asia economist Sian Fenner said: “There is little doubt that with the US threatening extra tariffs on China, its NAFTA allies, the European Union (EU) and others, which will prompt retaliations, we are moving a little closer to a trade war.”  If all the tariff threats materialise, global trade flows and financial markets will be hit.  “The increase in tariffs will have an impact on global trade. Another is the reaction from financial markets, which could fall given the flight to safe haven. We can expect the US dollar to appreciate and correspondingly, some of the Asian currencies to depreciate,” she explained.  HOW BAD COULD IT BE FOR SINGAPORE? Under that backdrop, trade-dependent Singapore will feel some pain even if it is not a direct target of the tariffs, said Ms Fenner.  “Exports will be hit and that will affect export-dependent sectors, like transportation and storage, wholesale and retail. Singapore being an important financial hub will also be hit if financial markets get adversely impacted. Private investments may slow as an uncertain outlook and weaker external demand will have implications on business decisions.”  As a result of that “bad case scenario”, Ms Fenner said Singapore could see a lower growth figure of 2.9 per cent, instead of 3.1 per cent, this year. For 2019, the impact would be more severe with the economy slowing to 1.7 per cent – a reduction of 0.7 percentage points from Ms Fenner’s initial estimate.  In total, that could mean a loss of S$3.4 billion in GDP in the event of an all-out trade war.  In an analysis by DBS chief economist Taimur Baig, a full-blown trade war – defined to be a scenario with 15 to 25 per cent tariffs on all products traded between China and the US – could shave 0.25 percentage points off the GDP of both economies this year, and 0.5 percentage points in the following year.  “This would set off a major global chain reaction,” wrote Mr Baig in a Jul 3 note. “Given their trade openness and exposure to the electronics supply chain, there will no respite whatsoever for Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in this tail risk scenario.”  Singapore would be the worst hit among its neighbours, with downside risks of 0.8 percentage points in 2018 and 1.5 percentage points next year, according to DBS.  OCBC Bank’s head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling is less bearish.  “While our baseline forecast for Singapore’s 2018 full-year GDP and manufacturing growth remains at 3.0 per cent and 4.4 per cent year-on-year, there could be downside risk from here,” she said.  “In a scenario where our worst trade war fears materialise, and manufacturing growth flatlines or even contracts in the second half with potential spillovers into sentiment-sensitive services sectors, the potential hit to full-year GDP growth could be up to 0.3 percentage points.”  Schroders predicted that Singapore is among the top 10 countries most impacted by the US-China trade conflict via supply chains.  For his research, Mr Botham utilised trade in value added (TiVA) data sourced from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Data up to 2011 were used to obtain a rough estimate of the value added in exports for 2017.  “TiVA data is used to analyse the effects of tariffs on trade between US and China because it tells you the exposure of economies to those trade flows via supply chain effects,” he explained in an emailed response to Channel NewsAsia.  “For example, only 65 per cent of the value of Chinese exports to the US comes from China itself, with the rest added by firms in other countries. These firms will suffer if the US applies tariffs to Chinese goods, and TiVA data helps to quantify that damage.”  For Singapore, the estimated value-added in Chinese exports to the US is at 1.33 per cent of its GDP, while that of US exports to China stands at 0.08 per cent. According to Mr Botham, that makes Singapore the fourth most vulnerable country to a China-US trade spat given its position in the global value chain.  IMPACT “LIMITED” FOR NOW Nevertheless, the impact remains minimal for now.  “The tariffs that have been imposed remain fairly isolated that affect only certain sectors. They have not impacted consumer goods, especially electronics that make up a key component of Singapore’s exports,” said Ms Fenner. “For now, there’s not much of an impact yet.”  Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing had previously said that the tit-for-tat tariffs between US and China have had \"limited\" negative impact of about 0.1 per cent on Singapore as they affect only a “modest share” of the country’s exports.  Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday said the local economy will likely remain on a steady expansion path this year despite escalating trade tensions.  Full-year GDP estimates are at around 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent – unchanged from the growth forecast range announced in May.  Still, its chief Ravi Menon cautioned that given the country’s position as a node in sectors like electronics, it needs to guard against spillover effects which are the “real risks” of the ongoing trade conflict.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/with-the-world-moving-a-little-closer-to-a-trade-war-what-s-the-10501706"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 06:27AM", "tags": ["Grab", "Uber"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Could Grab and Uber be forced to unwind their merger? Unlikely, experts say", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore's competition watchdog has suggested that the recent merger between ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber could be undone after investigations revealed that the deal has infringed the Competition Act.  The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said the deal led to a \"substantial lessening of competition\" in ride-hailing platforms, made it harder for new competitors to enter the market, and resulted in higher prices.   It will also be seeking public feedback on proposed remedies to address competition concerns, and has recommended imposing financial penalties on the parties. It also floated the possibility that the merger could be undone unless the proposed measures do enough to address competition concerns. However, experts Channel NewsAsia spoke to said that it was not realistic for the deal to be unwound given Uber's exit from the Singapore market and the nature of the ride-hailing business.  Dr Walter Theseira, transport economist at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that unwinding the merger was \"practically impossible\" because the ride-hailing business does not constitute only physical assets.  \"It’s a practical issue. When you look at how mergers unwind in the past, it involves physical assets that can be distributed - assets go back to (company) A or B. But what about drivers and passengers? You can't identify which driver or passenger used to belong to Grab or Uber,\" explained Dr Theseira.  He added that even if two companies can be legally obliged to unwind the merger, it cannot be enforced.  \"If I'm a Grab driver and I'm forced to go back to Uber, there's nothing that can stop me from changing back my registration to Grab. And for passengers, they'll think 'Who are you to force us to use (services from) this new competitor that we don't know anything about?',\" he said.  Meanwhile CIMB economist Song Seng Wun told Channel NewsAsia that the two entities \"cannot be restored\" because Uber is permanently out of the picture in Singapore.  \"Would a change in conditions introduced by Singapore's competition watchdog entice them back? I doubt it. Grab won the last time. What will stop Grab from beating Uber again in round two,\" he added.CCCS SEEKING FEEDBACK ON PRACTICAL ISSUES OF UNWINDING MERGER  In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, CCCS said it can \"require parties to unwind\" the merger \"by means of a direction pursuant to section 69 of the Competition Act\". However, it stressed that it is currently seeking public feedback on whether unwinding would resolve competition concerns caused by the merger and restore competition in the Platform Market, if practical issues would arise as well as the \"proportionality of any unwinding remedy\". \"The public consultation will allow CCCS to obtain feedback from various stakeholders, including competitors, riders, drivers, and members of the public whether the proposed remedies can mitigate the harm on competition that arise as a result of the transaction before deciding on the final remedies,\" the competition watchdog said.  But Dr Theseira suggested that CCCS' suggestion to unwind the merger could be a way to ensure that Grab complies with the remedies they have mooted.  \"I expect it's more of measures to ensure that Grab doesn’t integrate vertically further – like via its e-payment platforms, and other networks,\" he said.  Transport analyst Dr Lee Der-Horng said that CCCS' has \"ignored\" the fact the merger was the result of \"evolution\" following previous competition between the two companies.  \"Since Uber had lost the drive and resources to sustain its operations in Singapore, wasn’t it a good ending for a white knight to bail Uber (the company, the drivers, the passengers) out from the mess?\" said Dr Lee.   ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/could-grab-and-uber-be-forced-to-unwind-their-merger-unlikely-10502342"}, {"datetime": "06 Jul 2018 06:27AM", "tags": ["oBike", "bike sharing", "disruption", "technology", "ride-sharing", "sharing economy"], "author": "Devadas Krishnadas", "title": "Commentary: How oBike, Grab-Uber merger were managed shows we haven't gotten disruption right", "content": " SINGAPORE: The handling of the bike-sharing scheme in Singapore is a case study on the potential pitfalls of embracing disruption as a merit good. For the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to respond to the abrupt cessation of business of one of the biggest bike-sharing companies oBike and its unwillingness to refund deposits of its customers as being “deeply disappointed” is a stance suggestive of that of a spurned suitor’s than a firm regulator's. Government authorities, while rightly pursuing innovation, should not do so at all costs and in all instances. Such an unchecked embrace of change can be easily manipulated by industry players eager to be first movers, and not all have the best intentions. The LTA could have referenced the example of bike-sharing markets in China, taken a sceptical view and carried out better due diligence of industry players. FASTER, ACCELERATING DISRUPTION Disruption is not new. The story of economic action has been one of disruptions, small and large, from technological, organisational and product innovation. What is novel is the frequency and speed of the disruptions the global economy is experiencing. Frequency refers to the rate of disruption, while speed refers to the rate of distribution of the disruption. The Internet-connected global economy allows for relatively capital light innovations to muster major impact – think apps – thus lowering entry barriers which leads to the crowding in of technoprenuers. The same Internet makes the distribution and adoption of innovations convenient, rapid and infinitely scalable. TECHNOLOGY IS AMORAL Techno-evangelists have a tendency to treat technology as a merit good – in other words an unmitigated blessing on economy and society. Techno-sceptics on the other hand see doom and malice in technological change. In fact, technology is amoral. Governments have a responsibility to be proactive in exercising governance to manage the impact of disruptions. Governments have the difficult challenge of balancing the need to promote and have their economies adopt innovation on the one hand, and paying due attention to public interests and unpalatable, even if unavoidable, side impacts from disruption such as unemployment on the other. WISHFUL THINKING, MANAGING RISKS There are several lessons to be gleaned from recent and ongoing episodes of managing disruption. First, the handling of the bike-sharing market in Singapore shows we should not indulge in wishful thinking about the good conduct of innovators. Governments need to anticipate the behaviour of new entrants and put in place regulatory frameworks, even if broad and preliminary, to safeguard public interest against potentially bad actors. Second, governments must adopt a risk-management philosophy which incorporates a willingness to learn and apply new knowledge. Such an approach can be described as “forward learning”. A good case study of forward learning is the sandbox regulatory approach adopted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The MAS’s approach has led to a dramatic increase in concentration of FinTech players and growth in their market size and sophistication. However, the expansion has been contained within clear parameters which limit risks to the wider financial markets and retail consumers. The sandbox approach has also ensured that lessons are learned quickly and seeded into regulatory consciousness and ultimately formal rules. The MAS's model has rightly gained notice as a positive case study in smart regulation. CLEAR RULES Third, when regulatory safeguards are present, it is important to let market forces prevail. The management of the introduction of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Grab is a case study in mixed messages. LTA applied regulatory safeguards and clear rules. This ensured public trust in the use of the new services. The new services and ensuring competition brought benefits to consumers who enjoyed a wider choice, better prices and greater and more dependable supply. However, when it emerged that the two most notable players Uber and Grab had decided to merge, the matter was referred to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS).  But with regulatory safeguards in place, market forces should have been allowed to prevail. Excessive intervention in the market, however well-meaning can have unintended consequences including deterring future entrants. And there are future new entrants, such as Indonesia’s Go-Jek, who can be counted on to enter and inject the necessary competition to avert a monopolistic market structure. LIFELONG LEARNING Fourth, governments must be prepared to make structural and long-term investments to help workers adapt to and because of disruptions. Artificial intelligence is rapidly making in-roads to a wide swathe of occupations. Disruptions has resulted in job displacement many times historically. What is a further novelty to present day disruption is that the job displacement is largely impacting white- collar occupations. The Singapore Government’s overarching emphasis on lifelong learning, skills-based upgrading and continuing professional education requirements that have been adopted by professions such as Medicine and Law to maintain practicing licenses, collectively exemplify a proactive and well-resourced strategy to put in place the infrastructure and capacity for accessible and relevant re-training for workers impacted by disruption. CONFLICT, CONFUSION, CHAOS These four principles – avoiding wishful thinking, adopting a forward learning approach, letting market forces prevail if safeguards are in place and investing in helping the workforce adapt – are crucial to economies coping constructively and positively with disruptions. They are also responsibilities which governments are best placed to adopt and apply. However, this does not mean that only governments are responsible for managing the impact of disruption. Businesses have a corporate responsibility as employers to prepare their workforces and to invest and change to stay competitive. And workers have to take the initiative to help themselves to the opportunities for up- and re-skilling to stay relevant. High frequency and high-speed disruption will be an enduring phenomenon of the foreseeable future. Getting governance right will be critical in determining whether disruptions lead to superior aggregate outcomes for economies and societies or if these lead to conflict, confusion and chaos.

Several showflats extended their opening hours until 11.59pm on Thursday, with some developers even bringing forward their launches by a couple of weeks. The Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates will be raised by 5 percentage points for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying second and subsequent homes as well as foreigners buying any residential property, the government announced on Thursday.

Meanwhile, loan-to-value limits will be tightened by 5 percentage points for all housing loans granted by financial institutions. Among the showflats that extended their opening hours were Park Colonial along Upper Serangoon Road, Stirling Residences in Queenstown, The Crest at Alexandra, Seaside Residences in Siglap and Riverfront Residences in Hougang.  “All of them (agents) have been activated to sell tonight and issue OTP by midnight,” an ERA agent, who only wanted to be identified as Ms Lee, said on Thursday. “It’s like panic buying. You can go to any of the new launches; they are all full,” she added. Ms Ng, an ERA agent who was at Park Colonial, said that the situation was “extremely chaotic”, with long queues and lots of shouting. “All buyers desperately want to buy,” she said. Property agent Mr Eric, who was in the queue to enter the Riverfront Residences showflat, had been in line since 6.30pm on Thursday. He was there on behalf of his clients who wanted to buy a second residential property when Channel NewsAsia spoke to him at 10.30pm. “Why do we have to pay an additional 5 per cent to the government? Fifty grand could be the one year's salary for some people, so what is four to five hours in the queue?” Mr Henry Koh, who was also in the queue to enter the Riverfront Residences showflat, was looking to purchase his first property. “When I first read the news on Facebook this evening and got the call from my agent, anxiety kicked in ...

Speaking to Singapore media at the end of a trip to China, he also stressed that Singapore's position is one that is based on principle and not because it supports one country or another. Mr Teo’s comments come as the Trump administration is expected to slap tariffs on US$34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday. Beijing has also said it would reciprocate in kind. “We think that a trade war - tit-for-tat - is not going to help any side,” said Mr Teo. He said China has expressed its view that it does not want a trade war and instead wants to have a situation where it, together with the US and the rest of the world, can follow the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other trade arrangements to settle any differences over trade. “But in the meantime, so far as Singapore is concerned, we are pressing on with our trade relations with other countries,” Mr Teo added. Singapore and China, for instance, are working on an upgrade of its free trade agreement, with Mr Teo saying they hope to make good progress and try to conclude it by this year. Another free trade agreement is being pursued with the European Union and Singapore is working with ASEAN and its partners on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact. The Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership was also signed by 11 countries after the US pulled out of the agreement. “So from Singapore’s point of view, these are all the signals we are sending - that we support free trade, rules-based trade, multilateral trade, and we believe this is the best way in which we can foster prosperity for all countries in the world,” Mr Teo said.  He also stressed that Singapore takes a “principled position” on these issues - just like how the country says it believes in following international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for passage rights for ships and aircraft because it is a major trading nation. “So when we say, we are for multilateral trade arrangements, and free trade and we support those and the WTO, it is not because we support one country or another, but because we think that principle and the way of organising the world is a better way of doing so and will bring prosperity in the long term for all countries,” said Mr Teo. SINGAPORE-CHINA RELATIONS IN “EXCELLENT SHAPE”: DPM TEO Reflecting on his visit, which lasted more than a week, Mr Teo said bilateral relations between China and Singapore are progressing well. “They are good and there are many things we are doing together for mutual benefit,” he said. “In fact, I would say they are in excellent shape.” In Beijing, Mr Teo met Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng, who is the new co-chair of the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation – the highest level forum between Singapore and China. Mr Teo, who is the other co-chair, said the agenda was discussed for the upcoming meeting, which will be held in Singapore in September. This is also preparation for Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s first visit to Singapore in November. Cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative will be discussed, along with the upgrade of the Singapore-China free trade agreement and relations on judicial matters. It is also hoped that a Memorandum of Understanding can be signed on the Southern Transport Corridor, which is part of Singapore and China’s third joint project – the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative. Mr Teo, who had visited Guangxi and Chongqing, which are key nodes of the corridor, said the project has been “progressing very well” and has exceeded expectations. “The Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, coupled with the Southern Transport Corridor, opens up a whole new vista for relations with China,” said Mr Teo. He noted that while Singapore and China’s first two projects – the Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City – were focused on specific locations, with experiences there replicated in other parts of China, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative on the other hand covers many provinces. A total of nine provinces have expressed interest – from Guangxi in the south, to Gansu in the northwest, as well as the autonomous region of Xinjiang. ADAPTING TO A NEW AND GROWING CHINA As China grows, Mr Teo noted that Southeast Asia, including Singapore, will have to adapt and adjust to the opportunities and challenges posed by a new and growing China. China, in turn, will also have to adapt to the rest of the world. Mr Teo pointed out that the economic opportunities are very different – with China making investments outside of the country, which could have a positive effect in improving infrastructure across Belt and Road countries, creating greater market opportunities and fostering economic development. “But China also realises, and they fully understand this - respect for a large, powerful country comes not from how much you show your power but how you use your power in a restrained way with consideration for friends and neighbours and to put that power to the good of the world community and the regional community,” said Mr Teo.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/trade-war-singapore-trade-relations-china-teo-chee-hean-10502636"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 07:43PM", "tags": ["Thailand cave rescue", "Lee Hsien Loong", "Thailand", "Prayut Chan-o-cha"], "author": "", "title": "Thai cave rescue: PM Lee offers Singapore's assistance to Thailand ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has written to Thailand Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to offer Singapore's assistance to help with the rescue efforts of the 13 people trapped in Tham Luang cave.  In his Facebook post on Thursday (Jul 5), Mr Lee also said that he commended the Thai government's efforts. \"This difficult and gruelling search operation would not have succeeded without the strong leadership and coordination of the Thai Government and the tireless efforts of the multi-national rescue team, including the two British volunteer divers who first found the boys,\" said Mr Lee.   The 12 boys and their 25-year-old football coach were found inside the cave on Monday, nine days after they were reported missing.

The move comes several days after official data showed that private home prices had risen to its highest point in four years in the April to June quarter, with analysts predicting that prices could soon recover to 2013 peak levels. ​“The government has been monitoring the property market closely. We are very concerned that prices are running ahead of economic fundamentals,\" said Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development on Thursday. \"There is a large supply of units coming on stream and interest rates are going up. We want to avoid a severe correction later, which can have more destabilising consequences.  Hence we are acting now to maintain a stable and sustainable property market,” he added. The ABSD will be raised by 5 percentage points for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying second and subsequent homes, and by 10 percentage points for entities, said the the finance and national development ministries, as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in a joint release. There will be no change in the rates for citizens and PRs purchasing their first residential property. \n\n\n\n\n An additional ABSD of 5 per cent, which is non-remittable under the Remission Rules, will also be introduced for developers purchasing residential properties for housing development.  Authorities said that for purchases jointly made by two or more parties of different profiles, the highest applicable ABSD rate will apply.  However, full ABSD remission will continue to be provided for joint purchases of the first residential property by married couples with at least one spouse who is a Singapore citizen, they added. Married couples with at least one Singapore citizen spouse who jointly purchase a second home together can continue to apply for an ABSD refund, as long as they sell their first home within six months after the date of purchase of the second property, or by the issue date of the Temporary Occupation Permit or Certificate of Statutory Completion of the second property - whichever is earlier. The new rates are effective Jul 6, but there will be a transitional provision for cases where an Option to Purchase (OTP) has been granted by sellers to potential buyers on or before Jul 5. LOAN LIMITS Meanwhile, LTV limits will be tightened by 5 percentage points for all housing loans granted by financial institutions, the release stated. The revised limits will not apply to loans granted by the Housing & Development Board. Before the change, individual borrowers were able to borrow up to 80 per cent, or 60 per cent if the loan tenure is more than 30 years or extends past age 65. With the adjustment, borrowers will now only be able to borrow 75 per cent, or 55 per cent if the loan tenure is more than 30 years or extends past age 65. The new limits will apply to loans for properties where the Option to Purchase is granted on or after Jul 6.  Authorities said that in line with this, LTV limits for mortgage equity withdrawal loans will also be tightened - 75 per cent for a borrower with no outstanding housing loan for the purchase of another residential property and 45 per cent for a borrower with an outstanding housing loan for the purchase of another residential property. STICKING TO ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS Authorities cited the recent sharp rise in private residential prices as the reason behind these moves.  \"After declining gradually for close to four years, private residential prices began rising in the third quarter of 2017. Prices have increased sharply by 9.1 per cent over the past year. Demand for private residential property has also seen a strong recovery, as transaction volumes continue to rise,\" the release stated.  Earlier this month, analysts observed that the market was on an \"upswing trend\".

UBER WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT MARKET IF NOT FOR MERGER: CCCS The competition watchdog's investigation found evidence that Uber would not have left the Singapore market in the near to medium term if not for the merger, it said.  \"It would either have continued its operations or merged its Southeast Asian business with other potential buyers who were not its current competitors in Singapore,\" it said in the statement.  CCCS noted that Uber had entered into an agreement to collaborate with ComfortDelGro with the introduction of UberFlash to compete with Grab, and the collaboration was only withdrawn after the merger.  \"The transaction has therefore removed competition between the two closest prevailing competitors in the chauffeured point-to-point transport platform services market in Singapore,\" it said.  BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR NEW COMPETITORS CCCS found that taxi booking services, which have less than 15 per cent market share, pose an \"insufficient competitive constraint\" to the parties.  At the same time, the barriers to entry and expansion for ride-hailing platforms are high due to strong network effects, particularly given that Grab had imposed exclusivity obligations on taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, it said.  \"Without any intervention from CCCS, it could continue to hamper the ability of potential competitors to access drivers and vehicles,\" it added.  Several companies, including Indonesia's Go-Jek, local firm Ryde and India’s Jugnoo have expressed interest in entering Singapore's ride sharing space since the announcement of the merger.  However, with the exclusivity-reinforced network effects, any new entrant would \"likely have to incur significant amount of upfront capital in order to attract drivers and riders\", CCCS found.  The expenditure new entrants would have to incur includes driver incentive schemes and rider promotions, in addition to acquiring a sufficient fleet of vehicles and pool of drivers, as well as partnerships with taxi operators, according to CCCS.  In this regard, potential new entrants have provided feedback to CCCS that without any intervention from CCCS, it would be difficult to attain a sufficient network of drivers and riders to provide a satisfactory product and experience to both drivers and riders so as to compete effectively against Grab, it said.  Furthermore, the market for the rental of chauffeured private hire cars has considerable barriers to expansion such as significant amount of time and upfront capital expenditure to build a car rental network of sufficient scale, and a higher cost of maintaining such vehicles as compared to normal rental vehicles, CCCS said.  These rental companies may not be able to expand and compete effectively without a tie-up with a ride-hailing platform, and after the merger Grab would be in a strong position to put in place exclusive arrangements with the rental companies and the drivers who rent from these companies in order to reinforce its position in the ride-hailing platform services market, it added.  The competition watchdog said that without sufficient competition, Grab would be able to raise fares for riders and commission rates for drivers, lower the quality of its services and reduce innovating its product offerings.  It noted that customers and competitors have raised concerns over potential increased fares and commission rates, and reduced service quality and innovation, and that the commission has received \"numerous complaints\" from both riders and drivers about a decrease in promotions and incentives, reflecting Grab’s ability to increase effective prices after the merger.  Grab and Uber have not been able to show that the merger gives rise to efficiencies that would outweigh the harm to competition, CCCS said.  PROPOSED REMEDIES The remedies CCCS has proposed to address competition concerns include:  CCCS is seeking public feedback on whether these measures are \"sufficient and workable\" to address the harm to competition resulting from the merger. If the public consultation does not confirm that the proposed remedies, or any further remedies, are implementable and sufficient to address the competition concerns identified, CCCS may require Grab and Uber to undo the merger, it said. Members of the public view information on the public consultation on CCCS' website and submit their feedback by Jul 19.  PROPOSED FINANCIAL PENALTIES The competition watchdog also proposed to impose financial penalties on Grab and Uber, as it found that the companies carried out the merger despite having anticipated potential competition concerns, and caused a substantial lessening of competition in the ride-hailing service platform market in Singapore. CCCS had sent a letter to each company on Mar 9 to explain Singapore’s merger notification regime and CCCS’s corresponding powers to investigate, give directions, impose financial penalties and/or impose interim measures, it said.  Under Singapore’s merger notification regime, Grab and Uber had the option of notifying CCCS of the planned merger for its clearance or seeking CCCS’s confidential advice prior to completing the transaction.  Nevertheless, the companies proceeded to complete the merger on Mar 26 and began the transfer of the acquired assets immediately, despite their own view that the outcome would be irreversible, thus rendering it practically impossible to restore the status quo pre-merger, CCCS said, adding that its investigations revealed that the companies had even provided for a mechanism to apportion eventual antitrust financial penalties. In a statement on Thursday, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it supports CCCS' Proposed Infringement Decision.  \"We note that CCCS has proposed remedies to restore market contestability in the point-to-point transport (P2P) sector. This is in line with LTA’s review of the broader regulatory framework for the P2P sector, which aims to ensure that the sector remains open and contestable and that no single operator dominates the market to the detriment of commuters and drivers,\" it said. ​​​​​​​ Grab and Uber have 15 working days from the receipt of CCCS' Proposed Infringement Decision to make representations to CCCS.  The competition watchdog will then make a final infringement decision after consideration of the representations, comments and feedback on the proposed remedies, as well as all available information and evidence, it said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grab-uber-merger-competition-financial-penalties-10501708"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 02:36PM", "tags": ["WorldSkills Singapore"], "author": "Tan Si Hui", "title": "University students compete in WorldSkills Singapore competition for the first time", "content": " SINGAPORE: For the first time since its debut, WorldSkills Singapore will see university undergraduates, students in private training institutions and employees in private companies compete alongside students from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and polytechnics.  The nation-wide skills competition for Singaporean youths, in its 13th edition, is held once every two years.  This year, the competition will be held from Thursday (Jul 5) to Saturday at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre.  Winners will go on to represent Singapore at the international WorldSkills competition - dubbed the “Youth Olympics of Skills” - in Kazan, Russia, in August next year. In previous editions of the competition, only ITE and polytechnic students participated.  At the launch of the 13th edition on Thursday, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that along with institutes of higher learning, employers and industry representatives play a crucial role in encouraging young Singaporeans to develop skills mastery through lifelong learning.  The decision to hold the competition in a public area instead of at ITE campuses, where previous editions of the competition were held, was also a deliberate move by the Government to send a clear message that it was a national competition for youths from “all backgrounds”, Mr Ong said.  National University of Singapore's Loh Wei Hao, team manager of the university's water technology team, said paper qualifications are not “enough” and that the industry is looking for skills pertaining to the job. Meanwhile, ITE Central College student Beverly Chan, who is competing in the area of fashion technology, said she felt “intimidated” knowing that students from autonomous universities will also be competing this year but that it will not deter her. “Even if I don’t win, I would have taken away valuable knowledge and experience that others my age wouldn’t have,” said the 17-year-old. NEW COMPETITION CATEGORIES In total, about 250 students from 10 schools will compete in 26 competition categories at WorldSkills Singapore. These include nine new categories: 3D digital game art, automobile technology, beauty therapy, cyber security, fashion technology, hairdressing, rapid transit systems, freight forwarding and water technology.  More than 10,000 secondary school students will also be at the competition to learn about the different skills areas through an exhibition. Results from the competition will be announced at the closing ceremony next Tuesday at Republic Polytechnic. Last year, Singapore bagged two gold, three bronze medals and eight medallions for excellence at the 44th edition of the international WorldSkills competition held at Abu Dhabi. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/worldskills-singapore-13th-edition-university-students-10501556"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 02:33PM", "tags": ["oBike", "bike sharing"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "oBike appoints liquidators; firm to work with LTA to collect bicycles ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Bike-sharing operator oBike has appointed liquidators who will work with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on retrieving the company's bicycles. Mr Joshua James Taylor and Mr Yit Chee Wah of FTI Consulting have been appointed as oBike’s provisional liquidators, the business advisory firm said in a press release on Thursday (Jul 5). They will work with LTA and other vendors to ensure that oBike’s bicycles “continue to be collected and thereafter, realised in an orderly manner”. The US-headquartered company also said that the provisional liquidators are aware of media reports on the refund of deposits requested by users. \"The provisional liquidators will be liaising with (oBike's) director and shareholder or founders regarding this issue and to discuss whether it is their intention to provide such a refund,\" FTI Consulting said.  In the interim, it said deposit holders may send their queries to oBike@fticonsulting.com. Further updates will be provided to deposit holders in due course, the company added.  In response to this, Mr Loy York Jiun, executive director for the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), told Channel NewsAsia that oBike had previously committed to raise funds from alternative sources, for example from their shareholders, to provide a full refund of consumers’ deposits.  \"CASE will work closely with LTA to understand from the appointed liquidators if the liquidation process poses any obstacles behind oBike’s pledge to provide a full deposit refund to consumers. Consumers are advised to wait for an update from the company or the liquidators on the refund process before filing for a refund,\" added Mr Loy. oBike announced last Monday that it was shutting down its Singapore operations. The company cited difficulties in meeting LTA’s new requirements, which were implemented to tackle indiscriminate parking of bicycles, as the reason for its exit. Since then, customers have sought to get back their deposits, which adds up to S$6.3 million in total.

BICYCLES LEFT UNCLEARED POST DEADLINE  On Thursday morning - a day after LTA's Jul 4 deadline for oBike to clear all its bicycles off the streets - the bicycles were still strewn all over Singapore, on pavements, at HDB blocks and near bus stops.  In an open field in Sengkang, Channel NewsAsia saw more than 170 oBike bicycles lined up in two rows. An employee working at a nearby provision shop said the bicycles were placed there three days ago, and have yet to be collected.  Over at East Coast Park, a pile of 10 oBike bicycles, some of which were damaged, were placed near a footpath.  The bicycles were also spotted in Jurong East, Marine Parade, Tampines, Chinese Garden and the central business district.  In a statement last Tuesday, oBike said it has started retrieving some of its 70,000 bicycles and is working with LTA to clear the rest from public areas. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/obike-appoints-liquidators-deposits-refunds-lta-bicycles-10501542"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 01:00PM", "tags": ["NDP 2018", "National Day", "Boo Junfeng"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "NDP show segment to feature film on everyday Singaporeans, giant balloons and nostalgic mascots", "content": " SINGAPORE: As a teenage girl in the 1950s, Madam Mary Klass had the odds stacked against her. She had no family support, nor a coach, in her quest of becoming an athlete. But she did not let this get in the way of her dream to represent Singapore in athletics, training tirelessly instead. Her routine would involve waking up at 4am to do the household chores at her Rangoon Road home, then off to train at a nearby field at 5.30am. She would train again at 5pm, this time at Raffles Institution which was located in Bras Basah Road then. Madam Klass first represented Singapore at the Asian Games in 1954 in Manila, as a “nobody” but surprised everyone by winning a silver medal in the 100m sprint. She clocked a time of 12.5s, the same time clocked by the winner from Japan, a games record. The record stood for more than 20 years, she recounted proudly. She went on to represent Singapore in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Now aged 83, Madam Klass is one of five Singaporeans whose life story will be featured in a film which will be interspersed throughout this year’s National Day Parade (NDP) show segment. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday (Jul 4) at an event at which details on the NDP show were unveiled, she recounted how she trained with boys which improved her stamina and strength. Madam Klass said: “I was determined, and I wanted to do my best, not so much for myself, I wanted to stand tall for my country.” Her mother, who suffered from tuberculosis, was her inspiration, she added. She said: “My mum was not an athlete, but she suffered 17 years with one lung. She was a very strong person, and looking at her, that she can persevere her sickness, and never let her sickness get the better of her, that gave me all the confidence.” The film also features a former samsui woman, struggling student, a visually impaired busker, and a young social entrepreneur.  Film-maker Boo Junfeng, creative director of the show, said: “All five of them took ownership of their destinies and became the change they wanted to see in our society. The film will give us a glimpse into their lives, of the pursuit of their dreams and aspirations, the challenges they had to overcome, and the bonds they’ve made with the people around them.” GIANT BALLOONS, NOSTALGIC MASCOTS AND FAMILIAR FLOATS The show will feature three acts and a finale, with more than 3,000 performers and more than 100 costumes to celebrate Singapore’s 53rd birthday on Aug 9 at the Floating Platform. In keeping with the theme of everyday Singaporeans, one of the acts features a performance by people dressed in workwear -  parking attendants, port staff and bus captains among them. Giant helium balloon garlands, mascots to engage the audience, and floats depicting Singapore’s favourite playgrounds will also feature at this year’s NDP. Each garland, measuring 18m long and the size of car tyres, will be handled by performers, forming a visual spectacle. Up to 2,800 balloons will be used for the show. Six familiar mascots will also interact with the audience in the build-up to the show. Among them, Captain Green, which was introduced in 1990 to encourage a clean and green lifestyle, Nila the Lion, the official mascot for the 2015 Southeast Asian Games and Sharity Elephant, introduced in 1984 to encourage caring and sharing. Singa the Courtesy Lion, Teamy the Bee and Water Wally will also make their appearance.  Replicas of the Dragon, Dove and Pelican playgrounds found in Toa Payoh Dakota Crescent and Dover Road respectively, will form part of the procession of 18 boats and floats which will be visible to all in the Marina Bay area. Traditional crowd favourites, the Red Lions, the Singapore Armed Forces' parachutists, will return to wow the crowd during the pre-parade segment, this time jumping from a height of 3,810m, the highest for NDP. They will also be doing a wingsuit jump for the first time. Also for the first time at the NDP, they will be joined by divers from the Naval Diving Unit. The Naval Combat Divers will jump from a height of 1,830m into a demarcated landing zone in the waters next to the Floating Platform. The 10 Red Lions and eight Combat Divers will execute a combined salute to the nation.  Chairman of the Show Committee Colonel Goh Pei Ming said: “We hope that Singaporeans will feel inspired to chase their dreams, they will be fearless to overcome the difficulties that they may face, selfless in supporting the people around them, but more importantly, to be proud to call themselves Singaporeans.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-show-segment-to-feature-film-on-everyday-singaporeans-giant-10501222"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 11:58AM", "tags": ["crime", "court", "theft"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Jail for twins who gatecrashed wedding and stole bride's luggage", "content": " SINGAPORE: A pair of twin sisters who gatecrashed a wedding and made off with the bride's luggage was sentenced to jail on Thursday (Jul 5). Before they turned up at the wedding of a couple they did not know on Nov 19 last year, the twins had gone on a \"shoplifting spree\" in Bugis Junction, the court heard. The twins, Tiffany Kang Pei Yi and Tiziana Kang Pei Ying, both 30, had gone to the Guess accessories store at 230 Victoria Street where they left with three Guess handbags, valued at S$567 in total, and a Guess wallet worth S$75. All the items had sensor tags still attached to them. Details of how they got away with the stolen items were not revealed. Later that same day, the twins went to Shin Yeh Restaurant in Liang Court and joined a wedding banquet being held there. The sisters did not know the bride and groom - Ms Tan Huiyan, 26, and Mr Jamie Chew Jie Min, 30 - or any of the wedding guests. When the dinner ended at about 9.30pm, the sisters joined the queue to give blessings to the newlyweds. While they were queuing, they passed a table where one of the groomsmen, Mr Alvin Koo Jing You, 31, was standing. TWIN CONVINCED GROOMSMAN TO HAND OVER LUGGAGE BAG Tiffany told Mr Koo that she had been instructed to collect a pink luggage bag. The bag was hidden under the table and Mr Koo assumed that only insiders would know of it. This led him to hand it over to Tiffany, thinking she had been instructed by the bride or a relative to collect it. Tiffany left the restaurant with the bag valued at S$45 which belonged to the bride. The bag contained items worth a total of S$151, including a plastic flower bouquet, a roll of film and a box of coloured pens. When Mr Koo told the newlyweds that he had passed the luggage to Tiffany, they realised that they did not know her or who had invited her. Friends of the bride saw the twins at the taxi stand at Liang Court around 11pm and stopped them. They called for the newlyweds and Ms Tan verified that the luggage bag was hers.  Tiffany claimed that she thought the bag was a lost item and tried to leave in a cab, but Mr Chew stopped her. He then called the police. On Thursday, District Judge Eddy Tham sentenced Tiffany to 10 days' jail for theft as well as cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property. Two other charges were taken into consideration.  Her sister Tiziana was sentenced to five days' jail for theft, with two other charges taken into consideration.  TWINS HAVE A HISTORY WITH IMH FROM 2003 Defence lawyer Anand Nalachandran said the twins had a history with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) dating back to 2003 when they were just 13. \"These conditions formed the backdrop of the offences,\" he said. When asked, he declined to reveal what conditions the twins suffered from. He added that the pair were adopted as children and they were affected when their aunt, their primary caregiver, died of cancer. They were diagnosed with their conditions a year later, and have \"a tumultuous relationship with their foster mother\". The defence lawyer added that they had an argument with their foster mother on the day of the offences. Asking for a probationary sentence, he said that \"all the items have been recovered and there is no loss to any party\". Deputy Public Prosecutor Rachel Tan responded that probation for adult offenders is an exception rather than the norm. She added that the IMH reports did not indicate that any mental illness contributed to the offences. \"With respect to Tiffany - the IMH report said that she was feeling better before the incident,\" said the prosecutor. The judge agreed with the prosecution that probation was \"not appropriate given that they are adults and should have known better\".", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jail-for-twins-who-gatecrashed-wedding-and-stole-bride-s-luggage-10501036"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 10:46AM", "tags": ["China", "Belt and Road Initiative"], "author": "Olivia Siong", "title": "Singapore and China 'natural partners' for Belt and Road: DPM Teo", "content": " LANZHOU, Gansu: As globally connected countries, Singapore and China are “natural partners” for the long-term development of the Belt and Road initiative, said Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (Jul 5). Referring to China’s ambitious infrastructure project, which aims to recreate the ancient Silk Road through building land and sea links like railways and ports to boost trade, Mr Teo noted several common objectives have driven bilateral cooperation between the two countries. “Both our countries are committed to creating more opportunities for development and growth by strengthening global economic and trade cooperation to achieve win-win outcomes,” said Mr Teo. Mr Teo was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 24th Lanzhou Investment and Trade Fair, where Singapore has been designated the country-of-honour. Located by the famed Yellow River, Lanzhou is the capital of the northwestern Chinese province of Gansu and played a key role in the ancient Silk Road. It is hoping to revive this with the new Silk Road by positioning itself as a key transport link and manufacturing hub. Historically, Singapore has also been a key node along the ancient Maritime Silk Road, Mr Teo added. SINGAPORE AND CHINA SHARE \"COMMON INTEREST\" In his speech, he pointed out that both Singapore and China are trading nations. Singapore’s trade is more than three times its gross domestic product and China is the top trading partner for more than 120 countries, including most ASEAN states. Both countries are also dependent on maritime trade. “Singapore and China are home to the world’s top two busiest container ports with economies that are heavily dependent on maritime trade,” said Mr Teo. “Therefore, Singapore and China have a common interest in keeping the sea lanes open to vessels from all nations, upholding international law, and strengthening the multilateral trading system.” Mr Teo added that by combining both countries’ strength and expertise, the long-term needs for developing the Belt and Road initiative can be better addressed. PROMOTING BELT AND ROAD COOPERATION In particular, he said Singapore and China are focused on promoting Belt and Road cooperation in four areas - infrastructure connectivity, financial connectivity, cooperation in third countries and professional services. The Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI), which is the third joint project between both countries, is one example of how connectivity between Belt and Road projects can be improved. A key innovation in this is the Southern Transport Corridor (STC), which links the southwestern Chinese municipality of Chongqing to Guangxi by rail and from Guangxi to Singapore and beyond by sea. Strategically, Mr Teo said this multi-modal transport corridor is significant as it is the first substantive link between the overland Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road – which make up the Belt and Road. “It is a new direct, reliable, secure and shorter link that is entirely within China, to connect the provinces in western China to the sea,” said Mr Teo, who visited both Guangxi and Chongqing on his nine-day trip to China. Both are working with Singapore on the STC. The corridor has significantly reduced the time to transport goods between Chongqing and Singapore from three weeks to about one week. “The CCI-STC is an open platform. Singapore welcomes all parties to use this,” Mr Teo noted. “With more stakeholders, we can aggregate volume, build economies of scale and lower costs. This will benefit all parties. We can also facilitate trade by enhancing customs coordination, sharing and simplifying trade documentation to reduce time and transport costs.” Mr Teo stressed that Singapore and China are \"old friends\" and enjoy deep and multi-faceted cooperation. This includes high-level exchanges, with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang set to make his first visit to Singapore in November. “Singapore and China have enjoyed a strong friendship for more than 40 years, through mutually beneficial cooperation,” said Mr Teo. “Our partnership has progressed with the times, reflecting new needs and opportunities in line with the development of our two countries.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-china-belt-and-road-partners-dpm-teo-chee-hean-10500940"}, {"datetime": "05 Jul 2018 12:14AM", "tags": ["society", "work", "Chan Chun Sing", "Public Service", "Housing and Development Board"], "author": "Wendy Wong", "title": "Public service must pick up new skill sets to transform itself: Chan Chun Sing", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Moments of Life initiative, which bundles services and information for citizens when they need it, represents a \"fundamental shift\" in the public service's mindset, Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing said on Wednesday (Jul 4). The initiative, which was first announced last year as one of five Smart Nation strategic national projects, was one of the examples cited by Mr Chan on how the public service has continuously sought to improve its services to citizens. \"All these projects show a gradual but definite shift in the public service - that today, increasingly so, as we organise ourselves, our mindset is not how we serve our organisational needs, but how we serve the people,\" Mr Chan said during the Public Sector Transformation Awards ceremony. \"The people are at the centre of all that we do. This is the mindset that encourages me a lot when I see the public service in action because it tells us that we have the correct people with the correct values.” ADOPTING NEW SKILL SETS Addressing a crowd of about 900 attendees, including public service officers, Mr Chan highlighted the importance of continuously adopting new skill sets. These include building digital capabilities, designing policies and services from the people’s perspective, and coming up with whole-of-Government solutions.  Mr Chan said new programmes to help upgrade the digital literacy of public servants will be rolled out over time. \"Increasingly, the types of problems we face will be inter-disciplinary and inter-agency,\" said Mr Chan, who cited the example of the Housing and Development Board (HDB). \"Today, when HDB designs towns, it is not just designing flats and precincts for housing needs. HDB also looks at it from a social perspective – how do we design our towns to enable and enhance interaction and mixing? How do we design our estates such that today’s need for privacy do not lead to social isolation when people grow old?” Mr Chan also emphasised the importance of collaboration both within and across agencies, as well as with society: \"Collaboration starts from the basic premise that we have the humility to admit and accept that we can’t do it alone, and we do not always have the best ideas within our agencies.” \"It may sound daunting that we have all these new things to do, but we do not need to be afraid,\" said Mr Chan. \"If we can do these things progressively, module by module, and expose our officers to these new skills, I’m quite confident that we will continue to remain at the forefront.” \"We have reached a high level and are respected throughout the world for many of the things we do, but we are never satisfied just because of where we are. We know that many other cities are trying to copy what we do, and perhaps even overtake us. And this is why we can never be complacent about being the best.” During the ceremony, 400 awards were given out to individuals and teams in recognition of their excellent service and innovation. One of them was Mr George Lim, operations manager at CHIJ Kellock, who was honoured for his innovations at his workplace.  The 56-year-old had redesigned a trolley used to move tables and chairs to include an extra wheel and foot pedal, for the benefit of his team of operations support officers - many of whom are aged between 60 and 80.  \"We saw a lot of staff moving tables and chairs using a simple trolley. And they have to literally manhandle the trolley itself – lifting it by muscle and pushing it from point A to B,\" said Mr Lim.  \"Each time they carry heavy tables and chairs – I’m talking about 40 to 50kg of weight. And every time they carry about 400-500 tables and chairs. \"At the end of an hour, they will be so tired (with) muscle back pain. This cannot carry on, so we had to think of something that can make it easy for them to transport all these equipment from point to point without injuring themselves,\" he said. For his innovation, Mr Lim was awarded with a distinguished star service award, which recognises public officers with high standards of service excellence.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/public-service-must-pick-up-new-skill-sets-to-transform-itself-10499886"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 11:39PM", "tags": [], "author": "", "title": "46-year-old man dies after accident along BKE towards Woodlands Checkpoint", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 46-year-old man has died after his car flipped over in an accident along the Bukit Timah Expressway towards Woodlands Checkpoint on Wednesday (Jul 4) evening.  Police said they were alerted to the accident at around 6.30pm and that the man was unconscious when he was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.  Photos uploaded on social media showed the man's car, a silver Mercedes, flipped over on its side beside a grey Mitsubishi.  An 18-second video also showed a man performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on another man on the road shoulder.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/46-year-old-man-dies-accident-mercedes-bke-woodlands-10499838"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 09:20PM", "tags": ["oBike", "bike-sharing"], "author": "", "title": "oBike's usage of customer deposits to fund operations 'unethical': CASE", "content": " SINGAPORE: Bike-sharing operator oBike’s usage of its customers’ deposits to purchase bicycles and fund operations is “unethical and unacceptable”, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said on Wednesday (Jul 4). As of 5pm on Wednesday, CASE had received 1,044 complaints from consumers asking for a refund of their deposit with oBike after the operator’s shock announcement last week that it was ceasing its operations in Singapore. The majority of the complaints were lodged within the last week, CASE said. “Since the announcement that oBike would be ceasing operations, CASE has engaged oBike together with the Land Transport Authority (LTA). We were informed by oBike that consumers’ deposits have been used to purchase the bicycles and fund their operations,” CASE said in a statement. “CASE has communicated clearly to oBike that this practice is unethical and unacceptable, as the refundable deposit acts as surety for consumers to be responsible when using the bicycle-sharing service, and should not be used for other means.” CASE said that using these deposits to purchase bicycles and fund its operations means oBike would be hard-pressed to provide refunds without new sources of funding.   Under oBike’s terms and conditions, riders would have to pay a deposit before they could use an oBike. The operator is contractually required to refund the deposit back to the rider's account when requested. “The deposit was never intended to be used as prepayment for future services,” CASE said. “As such, the deposit ought to have been placed in a separate account to allow oBike to refund consumers when required. The deposit should not be used to purchase assets and/or fund other operating expenses. “We put forth our position to oBike that they should honour their contractual obligations to consumers.”  oBike announced last Monday that it would wind up its operations in Singapore, citing difficulties in meeting LTA’s new requirements, which were implemented to tackle indiscriminate parking. Since then, hundreds of worried customers have sought to get back their deposits, which adds up to US$4.6 million (S$6.3 million) in total, while oBike scrambles to retrieve its fleet of 70,000 bicycles that have been left abandoned in public areas islandwide. Meanwhile, CASE warned consumers that there is always a risk that their prepayments may be lost in the event of abrupt business closures.

Sounds simple enough, but there's a problem: It's not just a bit of mud.  Singapore consumes 430 million gallons of water a day (mgd), enough to fill 782 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and generates 300,000 tonnes of sludge a year, equivalent to the weight of 3,000 buses. These figures are not about to go down. By 2060, when Singapore is set to use twice the amount of water it does now, it will generate 600,000 tonnes of sludge annually. This presents a challenge, as Semakau Landfill is projected to run out of space by 2035 at the current rate waste is being generated and burnt. Enter national water agency PUB, which is trying to recycle more of the sludge into biogas, an important source of energy. PUB is already turning some of the sludge into biogas, which means its four water reclamation plants are 25 per cent energy self-sufficient. This is because its plants have digestors that convert the organic matter in sludge into biogas, which can in turn power generators. But within the next decade, PUB wants its plants to be fully energy self-sufficient. This means turning even more sludge into biogas through technological innovations. One way is through a thermal hydrolysis process (THP), which pre-treats sludge using high temperature and pressure to improve its breakdown rate in digestors. This allows more organic content to be converted to biogas. PUB is testing this technology at a demonstration plant at the Jurong Water Reclamation Plant. The demonstration plant can treat up to 70 tonnes of sludge a day. The agency is also testing a \"novel combination\" of processes, including a biologically enhanced treatment facility and energy-efficient membrane bioreactor (MBR) that helps shorten the treatment process, reduce energy use and maximise biogas production. This combination is being validated at the Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment demonstration plant, which uses 40 per cent less energy than a typical plant. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? Besides extending landfill lifespans, how will reducing the energy and waste footprint of treating used water benefit people? As PUB explains, used water treatment is the \"backbone\" of NEWater production, which currently supplies up to 40 per cent of Singapore's water demand. By 2060, NEWater will supply up to 55 per cent. The same goes for desalinated water, another national tap that will be stretched by rising demand. “Meeting future water demand with today’s technologies will see PUB’s energy footprint quadruple to 4,000GWh/year and the amount of sludge generated double to over 600,000 tonnes a year by 2060,” PUB said on Tuesday (Jul 3). “This is unsustainable and can only be overcome by leveraging technological innovations.” That energy footprint would have been enough to power 686,000 5-room Housing and Development Board flats for a month. “The price of energy is going to go up,” PUB's assistant chief executive (future systems and technology) Harry Seah said. “If you don’t do anything today, the cost of producing water is going to go up.” WATER PRICES When asked if the technological innovations would help keep water prices stable, Mr Seah said “we do our part through efficiency to drag it (out) as long as possible, that’s the best I can do”. Since July, the price of water has gone up 30 per cent following a two-step increase. The hike was in line with the rising costs of producing water. “Whether the price will go up, I don’t know, but we can try our best to make our water affordable to the public,” he added, highlighting that it would also depend on other factors like manpower.  “Basically, we have to look at it from the point of view of sustainability, besides dollar and cents.” INVESTING IN R&D And so PUB's target is clear: Produce double the amount of water to meet 2060 demand, but with the same energy and waste footprint. To do this, it has - together with partners - invested an average of S$30 million a year in water technology research and development (R&D), enabling technologies like THP and MBR to progress beyond proof-of-concept. For instance in desalination, PUB has invested in electro-deionisation (EDI) technology, which uses an electric field to extract dissolved salts from seawater. In contrast, desalination is currently done by reverse osmosis (RO), which involves pushing seawater through membranes that filter out salts and impurities. The fact that EDI revolves around extracting a small component out of a larger base, as opposed to other way round in RO, means it consumes less energy. While current desalination technology uses 3.5kWh/m3, an EDI demonstration plant in Tuas is consuming 2.4kWh/m3 to process 3,800m3 of water a day. The target is to bring this down to 1.8kWh/m3 by the end of the year, while there are also plans to further validate the technology at 10,000m3 of water a day at the new Tuas Desalination Plant. Beyond EDI, PUB is pouring resources into other water technologies ranging from electrical fields to cell membranes, all in the name of reducing energy consumption. REDUCING WATER DEMAND While these bode well for boosting the efficiency of water supply, Mr Seah insisted that managing water demand is equally important. “Even when I say water demand is doubled, I’m going to try ways and means to impede the rate of increase of the demand,” he said. Mr Seah said the PUB has been “quite aggressive” in encouraging industries to recycle their processed water, in a bid to reduce demand by 3mgd every year.  As for consumers, Mr Seah said the automated meter reading (AMR) project will help PUB monitor efficiency and energy savings, as well as calibrate demand and supply. In 2016, PUB piloted the project to provide some 500 households in Punggol with “timely” information on water consumption. “Most important, it is to change the behaviour of consumption,” Mr Seah added. “If you turn it into a behavioural change, if a member of the public thinks it’s the last drop, then you will be very careful using water.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pub-wants-to-produce-more-water-with-same-energy-waste-10498142"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 07:00PM", "tags": ["Seletar Airport", "Changi Airport Group"], "author": "Cheryl Lin", "title": "New Seletar Airport passenger terminal to open by end-2018", "content": " SINGAPORE: The new passenger terminal at Seletar Airport which costs S$80 million will be operational by the end of 2018, said Changi Airport Group (CAG). The two-storey, 10,000 sq m terminal can handle 700,000 passenger movements a year - about 26 times more than the number of passengers it saw in 2016, according to CAG. The departure area will house four check-in counters, six immigration lanes, two security screening stations and a gate holdroom that can accommodate 200 passengers. “This new terminal will provide Seletar Airport with the capacity it needs to handle the upcoming growth in aviation activities in the years ahead,” said Mr Khoh Su Lim, Deputy General Manager of the airport. “It's going to provide our passengers with a more efficient process flow for both scheduled as well as non-scheduled passengers.\" Managed by CAG, the terminal will also have three aircraft parking stands next to it. That will increase the efficiency and convenience of boarding the planes, the management team said. A private area, known as the Seletar Business Aviation Centre, will also be set up for those travelling on chartered business flights and private jets. But the terminal will not have any retail outlets, except for one food & beverage stall. Malaysian carrier Firefly will shift its operations from Changi Airport to Seletar when the terminal opens. It will continue running its 20 daily turboprop flights – to and from Subang, Ipoh and Kuantan. Changi Airport Group said relocating these “smaller and slower aircraft operations” to Seletar would help “optimise the use of resources to meet growing capacity demands” at Changi. Observers say that this move would benefit certain segments of the market. “Some consumers who fly between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur will benefit as they might appreciate the convenience of a very small airport that’s easy to go through,” said Mr Brendan Sobie, Chief Analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. Another plus for consumers is that fares could go down if more players enter the market. “We expect competition on the route, which hasn’t been possible until the opening of this airport. Malindo Air may now be able to compete with Firefly on the market - which should drive down the fares, which are relatively high between Changi and Subang. What that will do is potentially stimulate initial demand,” added Mr Sobie. However, he also said that the new terminal may not move the needle on Singapore’s passenger arrivals. Its capacity is about 1 per cent the size of Changi Airport’s 62 million passenger arrivals last year.  The upgrade marks the latest step in the redevelopment of Seletar Airport which started in 2008. Since then, the airport has undergone several enhancements, such as the lengthening of its runway and the construction of a new control tower and fire station. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-seletar-airport-passenger-terminal-to-open-by-end-2018-10495152"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 06:21PM", "tags": ["World Cup"], "author": "", "title": "Toggle offers S$10 World Cup subscription rebate after streaming issues on Tuesday", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mediacorp's entertainment service Toggle said on Wednesday (Jul 4) it is offering a S$10 rebate for World Cup pass holders after customers experienced issues with the streaming of the match between Sweden and Switzerland on Tuesday.  The glitch occurred at 11.15pm, Toggle said in a Facebook post, and was fixed before midnight.  \"By then the match was over and customers were disappointed.

The 34-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, had asked his daughter to pack his phone charger into his bag for work on Jul 24 last year. The girl, then 11, did not do so. She did not hear her father's instructions as she had an ear infection. The man became angry and scolded her. He first threw an empty plastic bottle at the girl's leg, before using both hands to push her onto the floor in a sitting position. While the girl was on the floor, her father kicked and punched her back and thigh multiple times, court documents revealed. He also grabbed the girl by her hair, pulled her up and threw her onto a bed, before dragging her off the bed by her legs, causing her head to hit the edge of the bed frame. The man then dragged his daughter over a distance of about 5m and kicked her a few more times. He shook her before asking her to leave the house. The entire assault lasted for about half an hour.

This will more than double the number of unsold units within the next one to two years, it said.   “We have to ask ourselves if demand can match the supply that is coming on stream in the next few years,” said Mr Menon. “That is our concern.”  With that, the central bank is “sounding caution” to developers, individual property buyers and banks to be sober, balanced and exercise good judgement amid the “euphoria” in the market.  Developers, for instance, should be cautious when making their land bids, bearing in mind the supply coming through.  The central bank is also reminding individual investors to be cautious of debt servicing burdens amid a rising interest rate environment, and avoid taking on too much leverage for property purchases.  Banks also have to be careful when underwriting and should perform stress tests for future scenarios, said the central bank chief.  Flash estimates released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) earlier this week showed private home prices rising to its highest point in four years over the second quarter. Analysts have predicted that prices could recover to 2013 peak levels soon.   Meanwhile, the number of property transactions over the last 12 months was around 25 per cent higher than during the previous 12 months, according to Mr Menon.  New housing loans over the last 12 months have also risen by 34 per cent year-on-year.

Muhammad Ruzaini Johari, 33, was a staff nurse at an in-house clinic in Yishun. The victim, who cannot be named due to a gag order, visited the company clinic with her husband at around 8.40pm on May 11 last year. The 28-year-old woman had a headache, pain in her ears and a sore throat. The pair saw that the lights were still on and thought the clinic was still open. However, the doctor on duty had left and no doctors were present when the couple arrived. Ruzaini had stayed back in the clinic to complete administrative tasks. When he saw the couple, he directed the woman into the consultation room. The husband stayed outside. Ruzaini took the woman's temperature, checked her throat and used other medical tools while \"examining\" her, including a stethoscope and a blood pressure monitor. He then instructed the woman to lie down on a bed. He lifted her shirt and exposed her stomach, pressing onto the area and moving downwards until his hands reached the area above her groin. HE PLACED ELECTRODES ON HER BODY The woman felt embarrassed but did not protest as she believed that Ruzaini was a qualified doctor, court documents said. Ruzaini then decided to conduct an electrocardiogram test on the patient, even though he knew there was no reason for him to do so. The test records the electrical activity of the heart and can be used to check for signs of heart disease. Ruzaini lifted the woman's shirt and undid her brassiere, exposing her breasts. He applied electrodes - pads pasted on the skin and connected to the electrocardiogram device through wires - on and around the woman's breasts. He also placed one each on her wrists and ankles. At this point, the woman felt very uncomfortable and realised Ruzaini's actions were odd. She sat up and confronted Ruzaini, before getting dressed and leaving the room. She burst into tears when she told her husband what had happened. Her husband was very angry and called the police, reporting that: \"The doctor had molested my wife.\" Ruzaini, who is now a trainee deck cadet with a shipping company, is not a registered doctor in the register of medical practitioners, investigations revealed. He was also not authorised to conduct any medical examinations, including electrocardiogram tests, without directions from a registered doctor. He pleaded guilty on Tuesday. While Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim called for at least nine months' jail, the defence asked for six months' jail, saying that Ruzaini was sincerely remorseful and ashamed of his transgression. Defence lawyer Sunil Sudheesan said the clinic closes at 8.30pm every day, a fact that was stated on the door of the clinic. He added that Ruzaini did not know that the patient thought he was a doctor. However, the prosecutor said that even if Ruzaini did not explicitly state that he was a doctor, the medical examinations he carried out led the woman to believe so and resulted in her trusting in him enough to lie on a bed to be examined. District Judge Luke Tan sentenced Ruzaini to seven months' jail, saying that there was an abuse of trust, and that the woman thought she was receiving proper medical advice from a doctor. He added that there was no reason for Ruzaini to conduct the electrocardiogram test.

Flows between the US and European Union contribute about 0.5 per cent (while) NAFTA trade between US, Canada and Mexico contribute 0.6 per cent.”  “These are possible spillover effects,” said the MAS chief.  Alongside rapid inflation, protectionism “rearing its ugly head” has become a growing tail risk for the global economy.  While the immediate impact of tariffs imposed by the US on its key trading partners remains “limited” – with estimates for these trade restrictions to shave off about 0.1 per cent from China’s GDP and the US taking on a similar impact – the “real risks” lie in the spillovers that “can severely undermine global growth”, said Mr Menon.  For one, the impact of trade tariffs can go beyond the countries involved to others in the value chains. An escalation where levies are applied to a broader range of goods will also severely impact trade flows and growth, he added.  Meanwhile, the threat of further escalation is beginning to dampen business sentiments and unsettle financial markets. “If businesses around the world take a wait-and-see approach to global recovery, investment will be curtailed.”  “The world has clearly moved from trade tension to trade conflict,” said Mr Menon. “If this escalates into a trade war, all three engines of global growth – manufacturing, trade and investment - will stall.”  For now, the global economy remains in “good shape” but given slowing momentum and growing risks, growth \"may not be quite as good as last year\", he added.  SINGAPORE ECONOMY TO STAY ON STEADY EXPANSION PATH With that, Mr Menon said the central prognosis for the Singapore economy this year remains intact, but spillovers from global trade conflicts bear close watching. Overall GDP growth for 2018 is expected to be around 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent - unchanged from the forecast range announced in May - with the economy likely to remain on a steady expansion path. Turning to inflation forecasts, the MAS core inflation this year is expected to average in the upper half of the 1 per cent to 2 per cent forecast range.  The CPI-All Items inflation is similarly projected to be in the upper half of the zero per cent to 1 per cent forecast range for 2018, said the central bank chief.  On monetary policy, Mr Menon said this is predicated on baseline projections of growth and inflation, and does not have an aim to pre-empt tail risk scenarios.  “While we are closely watching global risks, our baseline forecast is continued economic expansion and gradually rising inflation. The threat of a destructive trade war has risen but remains a tail risk for now.”  As such, the MAS’ approach is to embark on monetary policy normalisation, but to do so in an “incremental fashion” in view of still-benign inflation and growing trade-related tail risks.  The central bank made a measured tightening of its monetary policy in April after keeping to a neutral stance for two years.  Hence in the short term, the policy band provides “sufficient room for the Sing dollar nominal effective exchange rate to accommodate modest shocks to the Singapore economy”. Further adjustments to monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves, as well as updated assessments of inflation and global prospects, Mr Menon added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-needs-to-watch-out-for-spillover-effects-from-trade-10498088"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 01:00PM", "tags": ["Monetary Authority of Singapore", "Singapore dollar", "currency"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "MAS' net profit declines to S$5.3 billion due to strong Sing dollar", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made a net profit of S$5.3 billion in the previous financial year, according to its annual report for FY2017/18 released on Wednesday (Jul 4).  The figure, which is after a S$1.1 billion contribution to the Consolidated Fund, is lower than last year’s record net profit of S$24.3 billion as negative currency translation effects partially offset investment gains.  For the year that ended Mar 31, 2018, MAS made a gain of S$8.5 billion from the investments of its official foreign reserves (OFR).  While the OFR recorded “strong” gains of S$22.3 billion as global markets continued to rally, S$13.8 billion of negative currency translation effects was incurred as the Singapore dollar strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen.  This compared with the investment gain of S$30.1 billion made during FY2016/17, helped by higher investment returns and the depreciation of the Sing dollar against some major currencies. “Investment gains … are inherently volatile,” said MAS managing director Ravi Menon.  “The best way to interpret the number is to look at the 10-year average (which is a) good judgment of the kinds of investment gains that MAS is making over a long-term period. Year to year, there will be fluctuations.” Over the last 10 financial years, investment gains, derived after stripping out currency translation effects, averaged S$12.1 billion per annum, according to the annual report.  At the end of Mar 2018, MAS held S$376.5 billion of OFR on its balance sheet. This is invested in a well-diversified portfolio, comprising different asset classes across various geographies, for good long-term returns and resilience across market conditions.  About three-quarters of the MAS’ portfolio are denominated in the US dollar, euro, yen and British pound, with the greenback forming the bulk.

In response to questions on bike-sharing operator oBike’s exit from the Singapore market, Dr Puthucheary said: “The (bike-sharing) space is still evolving and we will continue to engage with the operators as well as the consumers as well as people who are inconvenienced by some of the unintended consequences. We will study, we will engage and take action as needs be.\" oBike announced last Monday that it was ceasing operations in Singapore. It owes its customers a total of S$6.3 million for their mandatory deposits.  The operator added that it is working to clear its 70,000 bicycles on the streets by a Jul 4 deadline set by the Land Transport Authority. The company cited difficulties with LTA’s requirements for its operating licence as the reason for its exit.  Commenting on bike sharing’s future in Singapore, Dr Puthucheary said: “Certainly the type of business models and the type of operators that come in to run these type of business is going to be a very important part of how our next transport master plan will look like.\" He also commented on how bike sharing would fit into Singapore’s next land transport master plan, which will be launched in 2019.   “What’s very important is the last mile, at the integration between the different modes of transport ... So we take a user-centric approach.  \"How do you take a bike to the MRT station, how do you take a bus and then perhaps (use) ridesharing at the other end when you’re approaching the CBD. This is what we call inter-modal transport, linking up all the various parts. I think getting that right will be key to the next phase of our land transport masterplan,\" he added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bike-sharing-obike-unintended-consequences-government-tel-10497856"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 10:59AM", "tags": ["undergraduates", "Singapore", "portfolios", "overseas internships. competition", "job market"], "author": "Deborah Wong", "title": "More undergrads opt for overseas internships to stay competitive", "content": " SINGAPORE: More undergraduates in Singapore are expanding their portfolios by doing overseas internships, as competition heats up in the job market. Darick Chen, a fresh graduate from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), secured a full-time offer from Goldman Sachs Singapore after completing internships with the firm in London and Hong Kong. “In larger markets like London and Hong Kong, you're exposed to more financial deals and more complex deals that are going on. These things definitely boost our technical competencies,” he told Channel NewsAsia. But it wasn’t all smooth sailing, as he found himself having to work extra hard to prove himself. “I think it's only natural for people to question - if you're new to this country, you might be foreign to how this country is run, foreign to how business is run.” So in Hong Kong, he hunkered down and practised his Mandarin in order to deliver presentations to Chinese clients. And it was this mix of soft skills and technical competencies that he said gave him a better standing in the job market. At Mr Chen’s alma mater, an average of 130 students from the graduating cohort have gone for overseas internships and work attachments each year in the last three years. Eight in 10 NTU undergraduates have at least one overseas exposure during the course of their studies. A handful have received job offers from the overseas companies they interned with, and others from companies located in Singapore. Over at the National University of Singapore (NUS), students completed close to 490 internships in over 40 countries between August 2016 and July 2017. The school has seen a 22 per cent year-on-year increase in overseas internships completed in the last three academic years. NUS Senior Vice-Provost (Undergraduate Education), Professor Bernard Tan, said this is largely due to greater interest among students to gain global exposure as well as the university’s efforts to expand internship opportunities abroad. Meanwhile, Singapore Management University (SMU) has made it mandatory for all its students to attain some form of overseas exposure before they can graduate, starting from this August. This can be in the form of exchange programmes and internships. About 150 to 250 SMU students each year have gone on an overseas internship in the last five years. Cultural intelligence expert and associate dean at NTU’s Nanyang Business School, Professor Guido Gianasso, said students with overseas internship experience are more attractive for employers. “The decision of going abroad for an internship indicates a number of personality traits; attitudes which are very important for employers. For example, the openness to experience, intellectual curiosity, extraversion. Also the courage and ability to adapt to different environments,” he said. Professor Guido added that these are indicators of leadership potential, which employers look for. EMERGING MARKETS  The universities have also expanded overseas programmes in Southeast Asia, China, India and the Middle East to tap their high growth potential. Professor Guido said Vietnam and Cambodia are particularly keen on young finance professionals from Singapore who are bilingual, as they can manage Chinese investors. At NUS, a third of overseas internships completed in the last academic year were in Southeast Asia, while another one-third were in East Asia. NUS graduate Stephanie Lam was one of those who opted for an internship in the region instead of a traditional destination like the US or Europe. The marketing intern at Unilever Philippines told Channel NewsAsia that she had to navigate cultural nuances while overseas - an experience she wouldn’t have had in Singapore. “If I were to do an internship with a consumer-facing role in Singapore, the market is significantly smaller as opposed to if I did one in the Philippines or in a regional Southeast Asian market. I think this market is also exceptionally interesting because it's still developing and growing very fast. Because of that, there are many changes and nuances that people haven't caught onto yet, and I really wanted a bite of that.” One cultural difference she observed was how the market in the Philippines emphasised relationships. “So we really had to go down to talk to people, engage with them and build stronger relationships before working on a project. And that made the projects more meaningful.” Like Mr Chen, though she initially struggled to adapt to a foreign environment, the experience made her stronger - and helped her land a job at the firm’s Singapore office. “It's definitely helped that the projects are very autonomous. So we have control, as compared to having a lot of hand-holding in Singapore. So because it's more hands-on, lessons that we learn - maybe small mistakes we make and we fix - are a lot closer to heart,” she said. An annual survey of graduates from NUS, NTU and SMU found that 78.4 per cent of students secured full-time positions within six months of graduation last year. This was a slight dip from 79.9 per cent in 2016. While the Manpower Ministry has projected labour demand to expand this year, it warned that this will be uneven across sectors. Wanting to remain competitive was one reason Mr Chen and Ms Lam applied for internships abroad. And these attachments have also given them the confidence to venture abroad for longer postings in the future. “The teams from the regional markets are largely similar to the place that I interned at in the Philippines. So having experienced how it's like to work in those local markets will help me understand where my colleagues will be coming from when I work in a regional office,” Ms Lam said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-undergrads-opt-for-overseas-internships-to-stay-competitive-10497280"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 10:21AM", "tags": ["Singtel", "telecommunications", "Internet"], "author": "", "title": "Singtel customers experience Internet connectivity issues on Wednesday morning", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singtel customers across the island faced Internet connectivity issues for about three hours on Wednesday (Jul 4) and took to social media to express their frustration. \"We regret that our fixed broadband customers could not access their internet this morning.

At least half of the current batch of nine NMPs have indicated they would step down in September when their term ends. They are Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin, Mr Thomas Chua, Mr Kok Heng Leun and Mr Azmoon Ahmad.  NMPs may choose to be considered for re-appointment, and each term lasts about two and a half years. “Sometimes they may make the Government feel uncomfortable but then that's how it ought to be. Not for its own sake, but issues that are difficult, awkward, that ought to be discussed … ought to be discussed. And I think it's the Government's responsibility to also respond,” said Mr Tan, who also chairs the eight-member Special Select Committee that looks at the names of people qualified for appointment. Mr Tan expressed hope that by doing so, it would pave the way for other Members of Parliament to chip in with their perspectives, and these dialogues and discussions could lead to better decisions made on policies.  The other members in the committee are Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Education Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon, Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, Sembawang GRC MP Vikram Nair and Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong. On what Parliament was looking for in its next batch of NMPs, Mr Tan said it’s individuals who are able to put forward the issues to the best of their ability.  “Whether it means being bold, whether it means being confrontational, it really is left to the individual to decide how he or she wishes to do it. We've spelt out the criterion for what we're looking for,\" he said.  \"We’re looking for individuals who are committed, who are passionate and who may be able to represent the views of not just from within their community but across the various communities as well.\" When asked if Singapore is ready for bolder voices to be heard in Parliament, Mr Tan said it doesn’t have a choice.  “We ought to be ready, and we should be ready to accept because it represents society out there. Increasingly we have an electorate which is educated, who have expectations, who has access to a lot more information. They have views, aspirations and we need to allow those voices to be manifested,\" he said.  “The job of any government is to listen, to take on board as many perspectives as possible, sense-make as to what would eventually be sensible to be incorporated into policies and that’s what governments must do.  \"Now if it makes the Government uncomfortable – and I’ve been there before because I was a Cabinet minister, and it can be uncomfortable – but I think we need to learn to embrace that because it keeps us on our toes, it makes us think harder about the policies that we make.”  The NMP scheme was introduced in 1990 to provide alternative voices in Parliament. There are seven functional groups that will provide the names of suitable candidates. The groups are business and industry, the professions, the labour movement, social service organisations, the civic and people sector, tertiary education institutions, and the arts, media and sports. The Office of the Clerk of Parliament said nominees should have rendered distinguished public service, brought honour to Singapore, or have distinguished themselves in their respective field.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/current-batch-of-nmps-have-done-well-tan-chuan-jin-10496430"}, {"datetime": "04 Jul 2018 12:17AM", "tags": ["oBike", "Land Transport Authority"], "author": "", "title": "LTA 'deeply disappointed' in oBike, says will impose fees if bicycles not cleared ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said late on Tuesday (Jul 3) it is \"deeply disappointed\" that oBike has \"reneged on its earlier commitment to refund customer’s deposits and in turn conveniently linked this to potential fees by LTA\".

In the second case, 68-year-old Abdul Aziz Saik Mohamed, was fined S$1,500 for five counts of pigeon feeding, with another six counts taken into consideration during sentencing.

When Channel NewsAsia visited areas in the east and west of Singapore on Tuesday, some of the iconic yellow-grey bicycles were seen stacked haphazardly. Others had seats and chains missing. The bike-sharing company is facing pressure on several fronts since it announced that it stopped operations in Singapore. Apart from the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) directive to clear the bicycles by Wednesday, oBike users are seeking refunds for their mandatory deposits, and town councils have issued more than S$118,000 in fines.  These were for previous offences of leaving the bicycles abandoned after a stipulated time, said some town councils contacted by Channel NewsAsia. According to Dr Teo Ho Pin, coordinating chairman of the 15 town councils under the People's Action Party, notices and summons have been issued to all bike-operators since the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in 2017 with these firms to cut the irresponsible use of such bicycles. It appears oBike received the most number of summons from Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council, with 172 notices of offences worth S$86,000 in fines, according to the town council's manager of corporate communications Fen Ng. Ms Ng said the notices were delivered to oBike’s abandoned office at Commonwealth Lane on Tuesday. When Channel NewsAsia visited the office on Wednesday morning, there were nine stacks of notices from Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council pasted on the office window, and a 10th stack wedged at the door handle. Ms Ng told Channel NewsAsia that the town council served the notices as it was “protocol”. She added that the town council has tried contacting oBike through calls and emails, but has not received a response. Two other town councils – Marine Parade and Tanjong Pagar – said that they have issued oBike with summons for offences, mainly for failing to remove indiscriminately parked bicycles from common areas. Marine Parade Town Council said a total of eight summons, amounting to S$2,600, were issued to oBike for offences committed between October 2017 and May 2018. Chairman for Tanjong Pagar Town Council Melvin Yong told Channel NewsAsia that oBike owes the town council about S$30,000 worth of fines. “Our town council staff emailed and called oBike’s management to pay up but they have not done so and are now uncontactable.

They ran over to the man's side, and found him unconscious and not breathing.   “I didn’t know what was going to happen next,” Mr Faizal recounted. Mr Faizal, an emergency response specialist and firefighter performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and asked the 20 or so passersby to call for an ambulance. His partner, Ms Hafawati said Mr Faizal was “very, very nervous”. She recalled him that his hands were shaking and he asked her repeatedly if he was “doing it right”. Ms Hafawati, a nurse at Thomson Medical Centre, has faced similar situations at work, but Mr Faizal - while trained in CPR - has never administered it in practice. She guided him through the process and checked on the victim’s breathing, Mr Faizal said. He added: “I don’t know what would have happened if she wasn’t there.” They noticed a passerby filming them as they helped the man, and had hoped it would not be posted online because they did not want the attention. The videos posted on Facebook by user Aaron Chua were circulated widely. The couple woke up the next day to see almost 100 notifications from “cousins, family, friends” informing them that their good deed had gone viral. At least  “we went viral in the good way,” Mr Faizal joked. Colleagues at work called him a “hero”. The victim, who was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, is recovering and Mr Faizal and Ms Hafawati have arranged to visit him soon. Looking back, Ms Hafawati said: “I’m very thankful that the man is still alive.” She added: “We just happened to be in the right place at the right time.” “One of his family members commented on my Facebook,” Mr Faizal said. The victim’s sister wrote to thank him for saving her brother’s life. The pair were honoured with the Community Lifesaver Award on Tuesday (Jul 3) by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Colonel Lim Boon Hwee, commander of the SCDF’s first division who presented the award, described it as “thoroughly deserved”. \"The man had suffered a cardiac arrest, and was unconscious and not breathing when the couple attended to him,\" the SCDF added in a Facebook post. \" Their timely intervention saved the man's life.\"  Ms Hafawati urged those who find themselves in similar situations to take action, even if just to call the ambulance hotline. “Operators on the line will provide guidance,” she said. She added: “It takes courage for someone to step up ... Don’t be scared, just help however you can help.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/couple-save-man-cpr-collapse-cardiac-sim-lim-tower-scdf-award-10495432"}, {"datetime": "03 Jul 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["MOH", "CareShield Life", "health", "insurance"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Incentives of between S$500 and S$2,500 for Singaporeans to join CareShield Life", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singaporeans born in 1979 or earlier and are not severely disabled will receive “participation incentives” to encourage them to join CareShield Life from 2021, a year after the new national severe disability insurance scheme is launched. The group, aged at least 42 in 2021, will receive between S$500 and S$2,500 over 10 years, depending on their age cohort, with the older getting more. This will be used to offset the annual premiums. To qualify for the incentives, they will have to join CareShield Life in the first two years from 2021.  Even those who have pre-existing medical conditions can join the scheme, but underwriting criteria will be tightened after two years.  CareShield Life will provide higher payouts for life compared to ElderShield, where payouts are fixed at S$300 or S$400 a month, and capped at up to six years, depending on the scheme. To make joining CareShield Life more convenient, Singapore residents born in 1970 to 1979 or aged 41 to 50 in 2020 will be auto-enrolled into the scheme the next year, if they are insured under the ElderShield 400 scheme and are not severely disabled, said the Ministry of Health.  They have up to Dec 31, 2023 to opt out and have their CareShield Life premiums refunded.  While there is no upper age limit for CareShield Life, older Singaporeans will have to pay higher premiums, with premiums increasing till they reach the age of 67. ElderShield 400 policy members who never opted out will have to pay just the base premium for CareShield Life, while others, like those on ElderShield 300 and those not on ElderShield, will have to pay an additional flat \"catch-up\" component. For example, a 54-year-old woman on ElderShield 400 is estimated to have to pay an annual premium of S$410 in 2021. This is after receiving a participation incentive of S$150 for that year, and only if she receives a permanent means-tested premium subsidy of 30 per cent based on monthly per capita household income and the annual value of her residence. A woman of the same age and profile but on ElderShield 300, however, would have to pay an additional S$100 for that year as the “catch-up” component. A 54-year-old woman who is not on ElderShield can expect to pay an even higher\"catch-up\" component. Of the existing cohorts, 38 per cent are on ElderShield 400, 26 per cent are on ElderShield 300, while 36 per cent are not on ElderShield.  Those with pre-existing chronic conditions will benefit most from the CareShield Life upgrade, said Assistant Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, Dr Joelle Fong. \"They are at higher risk of transiting into severe disability, and may otherwise not be able to obtain coverage from private insurers with strict underwriting criteria,\" she said.  Ms Sarah Liew, 61, a part-time bank associate is one such candidate. She said she will be joining CareShield Life despite knowing it can “quite expensive”. Ms Liew, who is currently on ElderShield 300, will have to pay a “catch-up” component along with premiums that will be considerably high because of her age. She was unable to upgrade to ElderShield 400 due to an illness, but will be able to join CareShield Life as it does not take into account pre-existing conditions. Ms Liew said that since these can be paid through Medisave, she finds the scheme affordable.  Ms Liew’s 86-year-old mother suffers from dementia and is considered severely disabled, as she is unable to independently perform three of six activities of daily living. These activities are washing, dressing, feeding, using the toilet, moving around and the ability to transfer oneself from a bed to a chair. Her mother is also on ElderShield 300. She said S$300 is not enough to cover for disability. While she and her eight siblings are able to provide for her mother, her situation will not be the same. “I only have one daughter. All the burden will be on her, so I’d better get myself protected,” she said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/careshield-life-incentives-2500-encourage-join-insurance-scheme-10495038"}, {"datetime": "03 Jul 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["MOH", "Gan Kim Yong", "ElderFund", "health"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "New financial assistance scheme for lower-income severely disabled Singaporeans", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new scheme – ElderFund - will be rolled out in 2020 to help severely disabled Singaporeans who need financial assistance. Eligible Singapore citizens could receive up to S$250 in cash each month. To qualify, they will need to be aged at least 30 when the scheme is launched. The fund, which will be administered by the Agency of Integrated Care (AIC), will not impose a cap on the payout duration, the Ministry of Health said on Monday (Jul 2). More details on how to apply for this scheme will be made available close to 2020, MOH added. It will benefit the severely disabled who are unable to join CareShield Life, a new national severe disability insurance scheme, or have low MediSave balances and inadequate personal savings to meet their long-term care needs, a spokesperson said. The severely disabled are people who cannot independently perform at least three of six activities of daily living (ADL) - washing, dressing, feeding, using the toilet, moving around and the ability of transferring oneself from a bed to a chair. “It’s a discretionary financial assistance scheme that is funded by the Government to target primarily the lower income Singaporeans with severe disabilities. Some of them have very different circumstances, some of them may have exceptional circumstances,” Health Minister Gan Kim Yong told reporters.  CASH WITHDRAWALS FROM MEDISAVE Apart from the scheme, the Government will allow severely disabled Singapore residents aged 30 and above in 2020 to withdraw cash for the first time from their MediSave accounts. They will be able to withdraw between S$50 and S$200 monthly, depending on their MediSave balance, and only if they have at least S$5,000 in their account. In order to withdraw the maximum, they would need to have at least S$20,000 in their MediSave account. They can also tap on their spouse’s account if they do not have enough, but the monthly maximum will remain at S$200. Those who are overseas will also be eligible for such cash withdrawals.  According to MOH, Singaporeans residents aged 65 and above have a median MediSave balance of S$19,000, adding that close to half of them have S$20,000 or more in their MediSave. “About 1 in 4 have S$5,000 or less in their MediSave, but we expect this to improve over time, as younger cohorts have higher wages and a longer runway to save, compared to older Singaporeans,” a spokesperson added.“When Singaporeans are facing severe disabilities and financial difficulties, we can afford to be more flexible in the use of MediSave, including withdrawal in cash,” Mr Gan said.  When asked if the relaxed usage of MediSave will mean that Singaporeans will have to increase their contributions, Mr Gan said that the Government is confident that the “current contribution rate will be adequate”. “Allowing Singaporeans to make cash withdrawals from MediSave and the setting up of ElderFund to support severely disable lower-income Singaporeans are both significant enhancements to Singapore’s long-term care financing framework, said chairman of the ElderShield Review Committee Chaly Mah. ElderFund and MediSave cash withdrawals are part of the Government’s efforts to boost long-term care financing in Singapore. Mr Navin Nair, 31, who has cerebral palsy and cannot independently perform at least three ADLs, said that while he is happy there are more avenues for help, the cash MediSave withdrawals will not go a long way towards helping him and others in his situation as employment is a problem.  “How can persons with disabilities build up these reserves? Majority of the severely disabled have problems with employment,” he said. Mr Nair, who requires about S$1,000 monthly for his medical, transport and insurance expenses even without taking taxis or private vehicles, added that the quantum of money through ElderFund may not be enough, especially in years to come. Healthcare analyst Jeremy Lim said that the amount to be given through ElderFund is small. However, he said: “This is a new scheme and I’m sure the criteria, amounts disbursed, will be reviewed with actual real world experience.” He added that the scheme provides a safety net for those who despite the other schemes are still in need.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/elderfund-financial-assistance-250-cash-low-income-disabled-10495028"}, {"datetime": "03 Jul 2018 04:31PM", "tags": ["Trending", "Dining", "KFC", "National Day"], "author": "May Seah", "title": "KFC celebrates National Day with new salted egg Goldspice Chicken", "content": " SINGAPORE: In celebration of National Day, KFC is rolling out a limited-edition fried chicken, available from tomorrow (Jul 4) until Aug 9.

Made in Singapore, these modules can harness more sunlight than the standard module by using half-cut polysilicon cells, for example. Their split sections also allow continuous generation of electricity in shaded areas. The modules have been a popular choice among customers in the United States, said the Norwegian firm which bases its operational headquarters here. However, the modules are now among thousands of products targeted in a wide swathe of tariffs imposed by the US. More than seven months since it launched an appeal with the US Trade Representative, REC Group — which is the only manufacturer of solar panels in Singapore — has still not been granted an exemption from the tariffs. The firm's spokesman said it will continue to work on the process with the relevant authorities “inside and outside the US”, including the US Trade Representative and the Singapore Government. As the US levies tariffs on goods from China, Europe and elsewhere — and retaliation in kind follows from the affected countries — there are fears that Singapore’s economy could suffer collateral damage, given the complexity of global supply chains and the increasingly inter-linked nature of world trade. Thus far, Singapore has been minimally impacted, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in response to media queries. Indeed, just as some firms such as REC have been hurt in the tariff tit-for-tat, others stand to gain. But one thing is for sure: If a full-blown trade war erupts, Singapore, even if not directly targeted, stands to suffer because it is so plugged into the global economy. An MTI spokesperson said the Government’s economic agencies are in \"close contact\" with firms in Singapore that may be adversely affected by the tariffs. \"Singapore has also registered our concerns with the relevant US and China departments and is continuing to engage them,\" said the spokesperson, who did not respond to a query on the number of firms affected. In January, US President Donald Trump's administration fired its opening salvo at imported washing machines and solar panels, on the basis that these foreign products are a \"substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers (in the US)\". While targeted primarily at China and South Korea, the tariffs on solar panels and washers — as well as those imposed on aluminium and steel last month — punish firms worldwide, except those that have been granted exemptions. Within a few months, the number of products affected by the US-China trade war has grown to now stand at over 1,500, amounting to a combined US$100 billion worth of trade between the two economic superpowers. At the same time, the White House is also waging other trade wars with Canada, Mexico and the European Union (EU). The MTI spokesperson said that the ongoing trade war between the US and China has had “limited\" direct negative impact on Singapore's economy to date. The ministry estimates that a \"modest\" 0.1 per cent of the Republic’s domestic exports are affected by the tariffs. Still, the Government remains \"concerned\" by the tariff measures taken by the world's two biggest economies, and the mounting trade tensions between them. \"These can have negative spillover effects on global supply chains and dampen investor and consumer confidence, in turn weighing on global growth ... We hope that countries will exercise restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions,\" said the spokesperson. ‘NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM’ Nevertheless, how the trade disputes could impact Singapore firms will vary, depending on their products, the role in the value chain, and their primary markets, among other factors. While REC Group, for example, may see shrinking revenue streams from its US market, other players in the solar industry here — which are typically involved in assembling rather than manufacturing solar panels — see some opportunities as a result. If consumption of China-made solar panels in the US falls, the Chinese manufacturers would have a surplus of supply, hence driving prices down for other export markets. This could in turn allow Singapore firms to extend better discounts to its customers. \"The tariffs dispute actually benefits solar developers like ourselves,\" said Mr Frank Phuan, chief executive officer and co-founder of sustainable energy firm Sunseap. If the tariffs make Chinese exporters less competitive, they could also allow Southeast Asian companies to make inroads into the American economy, said trade economists. While the term “trade wars” often ignite negative sentiments, they may not be all doom and gloom, said DBS economist and executive director Irvin Seah. He noted that Singapore may benefit from “trade diversion”, if Chinese firms currently operating in the US relocate their operations to South-east Asian countries such as Vietnam and Thailand, where production costs are low. “These firms may not produce their goods in Singapore, but could set up regional headquarters here, given that we are known to be good for trade financing … Hence, Singapore could benefit from this reshuffling of the global supply chain,” said Mr Seah. However, if more products get pulled into the trade disputes, experts said Singapore firms that are involved as upstream suppliers in the value chain could see their order books take a hit.  Already, Singapore-listed commodity and agribusiness firms, such as Wilmar International, have seen their stock prices fall in April following the tariff announcements. A broader cause of concern is how mounting trade tensions have led to greater levels of uncertainty across the world. \"This will lead to postponed investments. Companies are likely to adopt a wait-and-see attitude to see if tensions resolve and a grand bargain can be found ... Given that global trade is so interconnected, all economies will be impacted. No one is going to be immune,\" said Mr Eduardo Pedrosa, Secretary-General of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). WHAT SPARKED THE TRADE WAR Since his presidential campaign in 2016, Mr Trump has favoured a protectionist trade policy, an approach which he says is aimed at reviving the US domestic industry. In particular, his country's widening trade deficit with China drew the president's ire, prompting him to impose tariffs on US$50 billion of Chinese imports over 1,100 product lines, ranging from consumer electronics, agricultural products to sporting equipment. These are expected to set in this coming week. After Beijing responded in kind on Jun 16, announcing that it would impose its own tariffs on 545 categories of US products worth US$34 billion, Mr Trump threatened three days later to slap more tariffs on another US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Washington's trade deficit with Beijing — which refers to the excess of the US's imports over its exports for goods and services — rose to a record high of US$375 billion last year. Apart from narrowing the trade imbalance, Mr Trump wants to restrict Chinese investment in the US, as “punishment” for what the White House alleged to be China's “theft” of American intellectual property. According to US trade officials' seven-month investigation into China, directed by Mr Trump, China imposes foreign-ownership restrictions to compel American firms to share technology with Chinese companies, in exchange for access into China's vast and growing market. READ: Fork in the road for US-China relations as trade war heats up, a commentary. READ: No good time for a trade war but now as good as any other, a commentary. While China may be its prime target, the US has not spared the rest of the world. The US's overall trade deficit in goods and services with the world has also spiked 12.1 per cent to US$566 billion last year, the largest gap since 2008. In January, it imposed steep tariffs on all imported washing machines (up to 50 per cent) as well as solar cells and panels (30 per cent) on the basis that both types of imports “are a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers”. From June, the US also slapped tariffs on steel (25 per cent) and aluminum (10 per cent) imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU, in the interest of “national security”. The global oversupply of these commodities has “weakened (the US's) internal economy” and “threaten to impair national security”, the Trump administration had said. Mr Trump also called for the re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement — the world's largest free trade bloc comprising the US, Canada and Mexico — labelling it “the worst trade deal the US has ever signed”. COMPLEX IMPACT While small states such as Singapore may not be on the front lines of the Sino-American tit-for-tat, the Republic will inevitably suffer collateral damage as an economy highly dependent on trade. China and the US are Singapore’s top and fourth trading partners, respectively. The MTI spokesperson cautioned: “Should there be a significant impact on global trade and global growth, both big and small economies alike will be affected.” Trade economists agreed that Singapore, as one of the world’s top transshipment hubs, could be negatively hit by growing economic uncertainty and lower investor confidence worldwide. Firms here that supply component parts for assembly in China could also see their order books take a momentary hit, they said. Broadly speaking, they expect impact on firms here to be “minimal” to “moderate”. Forecasting the extent of impact on each sector is a tall order, said observers. They noted that it depends on the product, how much demand changes in response to price hikes, and whether substitutes are readily available, among other factors. According to the United Nations’ Comtrade Database, the Republic’s exports to China last year amounted to S$54 billion, up 22 per cent from the previous year. Singapore’s exports to the US totalled up to S$24.2 billion last year, up 7 per cent from the previous year. Electrical machinery, industrial machinery, oil and mineral fuels, and precision instruments are among the most traded goods in Singapore. While observers were divided on the extent of harm the trade spat can “indirectly” cause to Singapore, they agree that the dampening of global sentiments could act as a “drag” on the Republic’s trade-driven economy. “Products and services are often no longer made in any one place. They are made of raw materials processed in different locations around the world, and then assembled before reaching consumers … Singapore is a key transshipment hub in the world, and lower trade volumes (across the world) will have a knock-on effect on that,” said the PECC's Mr Pedrosa. Mr Frank Debets, managing partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Worldtrade Management Services, reiterated that it is hard to ascertain how “badly hit” Singapore may be when there are many moving parts. “Although Singapore is an open economy and relies on international trade for a significant portion of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it is also strong in other economic areas that are not so affected by the current trade tensions.” It may be better to analyse impact on specific firms or industries, rather than countries as a whole, said Mr Debets. ‘NEGLIGIBLE’ IMPACT FOR NOW, SAY SINGAPORE FIRMS  Firms in the solar and electronics sectors said they expect the impact to be negligible in the short run. Most firms that deal with solar cells here — with the exception of REC Group — do not manufacture them, and are thus not directly hit by the tariffs. Mr Christophe Inglin, managing director of renewable energy installer Energetix, said the tariffs on non-US solar manufacturers could actually benefit his business slightly. “We source some equipment from the US, but not much … Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will reduce imports to the US, leaving manufacturers with more capacity to supply to non-US markets, which could slightly reduce market prices in Asia,” he said. Like Energetix, Phoenix Solar — which primarily integrates photovoltaic systems — does not have extensive dealings with the US. Mr Alvin Yogaraj David, the firm's former vice-president, echoed Mr Inglin’s views: While sales of solar components to the US may go down, Chinese suppliers still have to maintain a certain sales volume. \"This may result in a decrease in price of solar modules exported to Asia … Reports have also shown that China has excess inventory (of solar components) and is expected to reduce prices to clear its stock.” REC Group — which has launched an appeal with the US Trade Representative to exempt two made-in-Singapore crystalline silicon photovaltic products from the tariffs — declined to share how much of its products are exported to the US. According to REC's report of its performance in the fourth quarter last year, it was one of the five most popular brands of solar panel for homes in the US. Apart from the US, REC also has “very strong relationships” with customers in Europe and Asia Pacific, said its spokesperson. Business owners from the electronics industry — which accounts for over a quarter of Singapore's manufacturing GDP — were unperturbed about potential spillover effects from a reduction in American demand for various goods, such as automobiles. “I feel these trade tariffs have not affected Singapore heavily, or at least not yet. The impact would be larger if the US expands the products taxed,” said a member of the Association for Electronics Industry in Singapore, who declined to be named. “The electronics and semiconductor clusters exports semi-finished goods to neighbouring countries for full assembly, so we are not significantly affected (by the tariffs).” Still, he acknowledged that the sector may “slow down” its investments into new product lines due to the uncertainty, he said.

Some observers, nevertheless, are calling for firms here to take action to mitigate effects of a global trade slowdown, such as by exploring alternative sources or destination countries for their products or ship them before the tariffs kick in. “Doing nothing in the hope that it will blow over would not be a prudent option,” said Mr Debets. Singapore Business Federation (SBF) chief executive Ho Meng Kit urged the industry to “be watchful over this”. “We should be very concerned,” he said. “Currently, Singapore is not directly targeted as the US has a trade surplus with us. But we will suffer collateral damage because of the integration of the global value chain ... Our companies should let us know if they are impacted.” Consumers here may also have to bear higher prices of some American exports, said Associate Professor Pradumna Bickram Rana from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “For instance, faced with higher costs of raw materials like steel and aluminum, manufacturers of automobiles and computers in the US would face higher costs of production and thus have to mark-up prices when they export,” said Assoc Prof Rana, who coordinates a programme on international political economy at the school's Centre for Multilateralism Studies. Perhaps what is of greater concern, said National University of Singapore economist Davin Chor, is the “broader chill” this episode could cast on international trade. “The invoking of ‘national security’ concerns by the US to justify their use of tariffs (on steel and aluminum) has set a bad precedent,” said Assoc Prof Chor. “It is much harder for countries to dispute what constitutes ‘national security’ concerns at the World Trade Organisation, which raises the spectre that this justification could be used with unchecked frequency.” SBF's Mr Ho warned that much as people wish for the current tit-for-tat to be no more than “high-stake negotiation tactics”, they could instead be pointing to something more permanent — the start of a “dysfunctional relationship between US and China as their interests and values collide on the world stage”. As a small country dependent on a multilateral, rules-based trading system, it is important for Singapore to work with stakeholders of like-minded countries to counter this negative development, Mr Ho urged. “We should diversify and lock ourselves in preferential trading arrangements with other regions such as through the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. We must be nimble enough to capitalise on changes in global trade flows,” he said. Even within the US, some firms that Mr Trump had said will benefit from his trade policies are now bearing the brunt of protectionism. Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, for instance, announced last week that it will move some of its bike production overseas to avoid the “tremendous cost increase” due to the EU's retaliatory tariffs. Almost two weeks ago, the EU hit back against Mr Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs with penalties on US$3.2 billion worth of American products, including bourbon, orange juice, and Harley-Davidsons. American automaker General Motors warned on Friday that Mr Trump's proposal to launch another wave of tariffs, which would include cars and car parts, could backfire and drive vehicle prices up by thousands of dollars. This would result in \"less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages\" for its employees, said the multinational firm. Until cooler heads prevail, trade-dependent nations are in for a bumpy ride amid waves of uncertainty, said Assoc Prof Chor. The escalation of trade wars will be a significant threat to the rules-based multilateral trading system that has over the decades provided stability and predictability for businesses to invest, said PECC's Mr Pedrosa. He said: I'm worried that the recovery we are seeing could stall as investors wait on the sidelines. “We are already seeing jittery financial markets around the world. Tit-for-tat retaliations will only increase the volatility.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/us-china-trade-war-effect-on-singapore-tariffs-eu-canada-mexico-10491430"}, {"datetime": "03 Jul 2018 06:35AM", "tags": ["productivity", "innovation", "growth", "business", "economy"], "author": "Devadas Krishnadas", "title": "Commentary: Core to growth, yet productivity has lost its shine ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The world we know today is a function of productivity gains over time. Productivity is at the core of the story of growth. It is productivity improvements driven by innovation, technology and skills which explain the global growth story since the industrial revolution in the eighteenth century. With this growth, has come the uplifting general welfare of wide swathes of the global population. However today, despite all the hype and excitement on the promise of a digital future, productivity has been in secular decline since the 1990s for all advanced economies. For Singapore, lifting productivity has been a central tenet of economic strategies dating back to the early 2000s and received intensified emphasis in both the Economic Strategies Committee or ESC plans in 2010 and the more recent Committee on the Future Economy’s 23 Industry Transformation Maps or ITMs. THE PRODUCTIVITY PUZZLE Explaining why productivity growth levels have been falling and remain at low levels of 1 to 2 per cent even for strong economies has challenged economists. There are variety of possible explanations. Standard measures of productivity may not be taking into account the full impact of digitalisation. It may also be that digitalisation has a very long cycle and the productivity gains are back-loaded and will be realised further into the future. It may also be that we need a fundamental rethink about how to conceptualise productivity. The most pessimistic view is that at long last, after 250 years, the march of innovation is petering out. The upshots of the productivity puzzle are twofold. First, that it is not unique to any one economy. Second, that a better understanding of what is happening to productivity is critical to sustaining growth in the future, making it an urgent priority for all economies. For every country, particularly those on the lower rungs of the development ladder, that imperative is crucial to enabling the well-being of their people. A more global effort to lift productivity matters because only by doing so can we aggregate resources, learning and share best practices sufficiently to match the scale, complexity and diversity of the challenge. Low productivity is not only a challenge for advanced economies nor only for industrialised sectors. Boosting productivity in agricultural regions will be critical to confidence in the long-term prospects of feeding a rising global population without excessively depleting finite natural resources and polluting the environment. THREE SHIFTS NEEDED There are three major shifts which are needed. First, there needs to be a greater recognition and sense of urgency on the need to understand productivity and to deploy effective policies to sustain its gains into the future. Second, there must be a higher sense of national and collective ownership of this challenging task. No one country can do it alone but all countries will benefit from the understanding achieved and solutions developed. Third, there must be willing leaders to champion the cause of productivity for the broader good. Strong and advanced economies such as Singapore would be natural candidates. They have the fiscal capacity to invest in research, test out innovative policies and facilitate the sharing of knowledge. Less affluent countries, with limited resources, must in turn be willing to be committed to learning, applying and notwithstanding the support of others, must to their utmost extent, contribute willingly and ably to efforts to improve their own productivity levels. Productivity improvements are something that has been taken for granted for too long. It has been assumed as axiomatic that with technological change will come productivity gains. This comfortable and convenient assumption is not holding true. All economies have a stake in understanding why this is so and what needs to be done about it. CHAMPIONING PRODUCTIVITY  Singapore is the current Chair of ASEAN. This, together with its economic strengths, place it in an ideal position to take the lead in championing productivity in ASEAN. Singapore should demonstrate that its interests extend beyond its parochial sovereign boundary and that it is prepared to play a role as a leading, responsible and effective regional and global citizen If Singapore steps forward as a role model, there is every chance that other Asian advanced economies such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan will be inspired to join forces to achieve critical mass in productivity targeted research, policy and programme efforts. Singapore’s impact need not be limited to Asia. Singapore has a history of taking the lead globally. Singapore made a critical contribution to the 1982 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and in 2015, it was designated the Asian venue for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the early 1990s, Singapore was the moving force behind the United Nations Forum for Small States (FOSS) which in 2017 marked its 25th anniversary. From 2000 to 2002, Singapore served as non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), with the added distinction of acting as President of the Council in January and May 2002. More applicably to the topic of productivity, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, served as Chairman of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) from 2011 to 2015. There is scope for Singapore to propose and take the lead to spearhead a Productivity Task Force (PTF) within the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The future is a shared space and there is no better panacea for peace and stability than broadly distributed and sustained growth and the positive economic and social knock-on effects that flow from it. Productivity and peace are conjoined twins. Not only are both worth nurturing, but one cannot be sustained without the other.

That’s why it’s a surprise that this has been so prolonged and keeps escalating.”  Last month, the trade spat between the United States and other top economies intensified, resulting in a punishing month for global shares as investors rushed to safety. In particular, threats of tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China fuelled fears that the world’s two biggest economies will spiral into a trade war denting global growth.  With the latest purchasing managers’ index (PMI) out of China showing signs of softening ahead of additional US levies on US$34 billion of Chinese products slated to take effect this week, stock markets around the world stayed mired in the red on Monday (Jul 2), the first trading day of the third quarter.  OCBC Treasury Research wrote that with “the under-currents in the global economy (being) centered” on the fresh tariffs that will kick in on Friday, there is increasing market concern that trade tensions could start to weigh on growth and inflation.  These worries mean that stock markets would be in for periods of volatility in the third quarter, warned DBS Bank’s chief investment officer Hou Wey Fook.  “In a global trade war, who’s the winner? Nobody. But who’s the loser? Everyone,” he said at a media roundtable on Monday for the bank’s latest CIO Insights report.  “If you read the history of financial markets, what triggered the Great Depression was also protectionism so this is something we need to watch carefully and hopefully, rationality will prevail at the end of the day.”  Meanwhile, trade war jitters are compounded by other lingering risks, such as rising US interest rates, the recent rout in emerging market assets and brewing geopolitical uncertainties in Europe, analysts said.  “Higher interest rates have been in the background but with the stronger dollar, emerging markets have sold down recently. So far, they seem to be idiosyncratic issues for specific countries, like Turkey, Brazil and Argentina,” said Mr Chew. “But the worry of a contagion risk remains.”  Meanwhile, the re-emergence of geopolitical risks in Europe have also stirred concerns, said Mr Hou.  Following risk events, such as Britain's vote to leave the European Union (EU) and the Catalan declaration of independence, the election victory of the populist Five Star Movement and far-right League parties earlier this year has ratcheted up policy uncertainties in Italy.  “The fact that there will be noise around whether Italy will exit the EU will be a headwind. If they do take the step, it will be very bad for European markets.”  All these will combine to fuel volatility in the coming months, said Mr Hou, though he does not think that recent losses mark the start of a bear market.  “We think the bull market is in a period of correction and will resume once things stabilise on these fronts,” he added.  IN SINGAPORE MARKET, BRIGHT SPOTS REMAIN Still, DBS has downgraded its three-month rating on equities to neutral from overweight. Within the asset class, it continues to prefer US over Europe while Asia was cut to neutral on the back of potential headwinds from trade tensions, rising rates and capital outflows.  Also cutting its position on equities to neutral, Schroders said this reflected a “more cautious stance” due to positive earnings revisions becoming less widespread and possible heightened risk aversion due to upcoming political events.  The research house is also positive on the US though it downgraded European, Japan and Asia-Pacific excluding Japan to neutral. Within the region, it added that it favoured the Singapore market where “the outlook has steadily improved”.  DBS’ quarterly CIO Insights report echoed that, citing strong external balance sheets and fiscal balances as Singapore’s resilient factors. Local banking stocks and REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), which will benefit from higher interest rates and are less exposed to global trade flows, are among Mr Hou’s top picks.  KGI Securities analyst Joel Ng also advised retail investors to be selective and look out for opportunities to accumulate on companies with strong fundamentals that have been oversold last month.  “It’s very hard to time the market and even harder to catch the bottom but if the valuations are decent, it will be attractive to accumulate some companies that have been sold down,” he said, citing Singtel, Sembcorp Industries and Keppel Corp among his preferred plays.  Looking to revise his year-end target of 3,900 points for the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) in the near term, Mr Chew said: “Last year was a very benign year, not just for Singapore but markets globally. There was little volatility and there was just one direction that is up.  “This year, there have been various flashpoints causing volatility. The extent of trade tensions was unexpected and not factored into market estimates,” he added.  The benchmark STI dropped 0.9 per cent, or 29.76 points, to close at 3,238.94 on Monday, tracking declines in the region.

The four men, now aged between 22 and 25, were serving in 2015 as special constables under Mohd Taufik Abu Bakar, now 55. In September 2015, Taufik told one of the victims, then 19, that his body odour gave him a headache. He then said he had some hair removal cream that would remove his armpit and pubic hair. On Sep 13, 2015, Taufik drove the 19-year-old to his home and presented him with hair removal cream and a body scrub. The teenager then entered the master bedroom toilet to apply the products. Taufik asked to enter and applied the hair removal cream to his subordinate's right armpit and pubic region without his consent. The 19-year-old later testified that he felt \"frozen\", \"lost\" and could not react. He said he felt like the whole world collapsed on him, \"so all he did was comply\". Taufik, who joined the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in 1982, also massaged the young man's naked body. Other offences he committed include pinching the nipple and grabbing the buttock of a 20-year-old male subordinate, slapping the buttock of another 19-year-old NSF and placing his hand around the waist of an NSF, then 22. He carried out these acts at the traffic police office in 2015. Taufik's conduct was exposed on Sep 16, 2015 when a few of the victims approached an NS probationary inspector about the incidents. Pointing to Taufik's \"deliberate abuse of his position of trust as a superior\", Deputy Public Prosecutor Amanda Chong asked for a sentence of two years and eight months. She added that he had committed the offences in the course of duty as a law enforcement officer and at times within the premises of a police station. Taufik, who was the officer in charge of the traffic police's hit-and-run investigation team since 2003, was convicted of six charges of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the four men. He was acquitted of one count of molesting a fifth special constable. District Judge Jasvender Kaur sentenced him to jail for 18 months and a week on Monday, inclusive of four weeks' jail in lieu of caning. Taufik cannot be caned as he is above 50 years old. In a statement to Channel NewsAsia, the police said that Taufik is no longer with SPF. He was interdicted or suspended from service since Aug 23, 2016, and retired on May 10 last year, after reaching the mandatory retirement age. \"With his conviction, his retirement benefits will be forfeited,\" said the police spokesman.  \"Officers of SPF are expected to uphold the law and maintain the highest standards of conduct and integrity,\" he said. He added that SPF takes \"a zero-tolerance approach to officers who break the law\" and will deal severely with such officers, including charging them in court.  The force will also \"not hesitate to remove them from their positions\". For assaulting or using criminal force on a person, intending to outrage the modesty of that person, Taufik could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or any combination of the three punishments.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nsfs-molested-traffic-police-inspector-four-jail-10490356"}, {"datetime": "02 Jul 2018 12:06PM", "tags": ["transport", "SMRT"], "author": "", "title": "SMRT Trains posts S$86m loss as ridership declines and maintenance costs rise", "content": " SINGAPORE: Amid a fall in ridership and higher maintenance expenses, SMRT Trains posted an S$86 million after-tax loss for the 2018 financial year ending Mar 31. The loss follows an after-tax profit of S$26 million for the previous financial year, according to an annual operations review report posted on its website on Sunday (Jul 1). Revenue declined from S$791 million to S$743 million due to a fall in ridership and lower average fares, the company said. Ridership fell from 768 million to 753 million, with average weekday ridership at 2,258, down from 2,353 the previous year. Operating expenses jumped from S$785 million to S$838 million. SMRT Trains said this was due to higher maintenance costs for the ageing rail network and higher loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment. IMPROVED RELIABILITY ON 2 OF 3 RAIL LINES  SMRT Trains' CEO Lee Ling Wee said in the report that the company \"recognises that commuter satisfaction has declined in the last year\". This is especially after the launch of the new signalling system in mid-2017 and two major disruptions late last year, such as the Bishan-Braddell tunnel flooding incident. \"Learning from the 7 October tunnel flooding episode, we have tightened work processes and supervisory checks across all levels in the organisation, and will use resources more effectively as we get our renewal and maintenance efforts firmly back on track in building infrastructure and facilities management,\" Mr Lee said. He also noted that reliability has improved on two out of three of SMRT's rail lines.  Between April 2017 and March 2018, the Circle Line and East-West Line saw an improvement in their mean kilometres between failure (MKBF), which measures the number of kilometres clocked before a delay of more than five minutes. The Circle Line's average MBKF for the 12 months up to March was 665,000km, compared to 281,800km in the preceding 12 months, while the East-West Line's MKBF rose from 151,400km to 171,000km.  However, the North-South Line's MKBF fell from 180,400km to 97,000km. This was due to teething issues on the new signalling system, Mr Lee said.  SMRT Trains' employee accident frequency rate for FY2018 was 1.44, compared to 1.14 in the previous financial year.

Note other railways in Asia", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sent shock waves when he announced in May that Malaysia will scrap the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project on account of its high cost. Its purported price tag is simply too expensive for Malaysia, he said. While official figures of the project’s expected costs from MyHSR Corp – the Malaysia Government’s project delivery vehicle for the HSR – have not been revealed, a price tag of RM70 billion to RM110 billion (S$24 billion to S$37 billion) has been widely cited. SHOCK WAVES Few expected that the project would unravel and in such a rapid manner. Just two days before Malaysia’s historic general election – a stunning loss for Najib Razak and the 60-year-old Barisan Nasional regime – Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) had issued tenders for the design and construction of its HSR terminus. On Apr 5, two days before the dissolution of the Malaysia parliament, MyHSR Corp awarded its northern alignment (from Kuala Lumpur to Johor) to Malaysian consortium Gamuda-Malaysian Resources Corporation consortium while its southern portion to another Malaysian consortium Syarikat Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay-TH Properties, with package terms to be finalised. Shelving the HSR project is consistent with the Malaysian government’s approach to review all mega infrastructure projects. Dr Mahathir also announced in May that the Greater Klang Valley rail transit line MRT3 will be cancelled and that the Malaysian government was putting on hold the China-backed East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). The market was equally caught by surprise by this slew of announcements. Malaysia public-listed construction and related companies saw their share prices fall. In a recent interview with the Nikkei Asian Review on Jun 11, Dr Mahathir said a HSR between Singapore and Malaysia will be needed in the future but it is a project that Malaysia could ill afford presently. “We cannot say we will never have high-speed rail in Malaysia. What we can do is we can postpone the project because it is far too costly at this moment,” he added. Is the project really too costly? HOW COSTLY IS THE HSR? The KL–Singapore HSR alignment will be approximately 350km, with 335km running through Bandar Malaysia, Sepang-Putrajaya, Seremban, Melaka, Batu Pahat, Muar and Iskandar Puteri in Malaysia. The final 15km in Singapore ends in Jurong East. The HSR is expected to offer three types of services: A non-stop 90-minute express service, an inter-city service, and a shuttle service between Iskandar Puteri and Jurong East. It projects 22 million passengers per year by year 10 of operations. Many of these passengers may be current travellers who transverse Kuala Lumpur and Singapore by air – about four million annually with return economy-class ticket prices ranging from US$50 to US$65 (S$68 to S$89). A ball park cost of the HSR’s construction would be about RM60 billion, without including land acquisition and loan interest, according to UOB Kay Hian Malaysia Research. Industry experts estimate land acquisition might rack up RM5 billion to RM10 billion more, and financing costs are expected to push the all-in costs to around RM110 billion. CHEAPER IN CHINA? Experts have compared costs of the HSR to Chinese equivalents. China currently has more than 25,000 km of HSR rail network with construction costs one-third lower than in most countries, according to the World Bank. With maximum speeds of 350kmh, its HSR costs averages about US$17 million to US$21 million per km even with a high ratio of viaducts and tunnels, and boasts lower ticket prices. Compared to their Chinese counterparts, the KL-Singapore HSR appears to have a higher proportion of costs devoted to systems engineering and land acquisition – making up 29 per cent and 12 per cent of total costs respectively compared to 18 per cent and 4 to 9 per cent respectively for Chinese HSR projects. The fact is these Chinese projects enjoy massive economies of scale. Lower manpower costs, and an energised domestic construction and equipment supply community that can build and adopt innovative techniques have driven cost down. Large volumes and the ability to amortise capital investment in high-cost construction equipment over a number of projects coupled with local equipment, building materials, systems and rolling stocks, also brought down costs for China. Data from the World Bank’s 2014 report also points out that Europe HSR projects (with speed of 300kmh or above) cost between US$25 million to US$39 million per km, while in the US, the recent California HSR was estimated at US$52 million per km but it has risen more since. HOW CAN COSTS BE BROUGHT DOWN? Strong concerns in Malaysia about the HSR’s absolute cost, which is almost double that of a typical China HSR project, have led to a scramble among Malaysia-based railway experts to review the KL-Singapore HSR with some proposing as much as a 30 per cent cost-cutting. Severe cost-saving alternatives and a rethinking of the HSR project, such as upgrading the existing KTM rail network for a less-than high-speed rail, to cut existing HSR project costs by two thirds have also been raised. This track upgrade proposal, pegged by experts at US$15 million per km, echoes Indonesia’s ongoing examination of its Jakarta-Surabaya project, estimated at US$10 million per km for the 780km track across Java. TAIWAN – A CAUTIONARY TALE A cautionary model to look to is the privately financed Taipei-Kaohsiung HSR – which has a comparable length, number of stations, travel time (for both express and intercity) and costs. Taiwan’s US$15 billion HSR began operation in 2007 cutting through the hilly coastal terrain of western Taiwan.  Taiwan’s tab of US$43 million per km is similar to the per km cost for the KL-Singapore. Taiwan also spent on some eye-catching train stations, in the same vein that Malaysia had plans for a few iconic HSR stations. Both are also similar in that they have costly elevated superstructures (for about half or more of the track) and some tunnelling.  But Taiwan’s HSR had to overcome significant engineering challenges because it passes through highly uneven terrain in an earthquake prone region. What Taiwan had going for it was its high population density. Within months of operations, its HSR was able to capture travellers between the two cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung with its low standard fare of US$48 (the average one-way flight was US$67) and its reliable schedule. But this has resulted in the huge cannibalisation of air travel – as airlines have also reduced flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung. While it has achieved a ridership of 48 million in 2017, the privately funded project has also run into financial difficulties. WIDER DISCUSSION IN MALAYSIA There will no doubt be a wider discussion on the socio-economic implications of a HSR or medium-speed rail – including a review of its cost-benefit analysis, the ticket price and its financing structure as well as the purported benefits in job creation, industry growth and economic collaboration. The Mahathir administration is in a good position to review the project, so as to improve the livelihoods of the average Malaysian and look into surrounding issues that include sustainability and affordability.

But the Republic of Singapore Navy’s (RSN) latest submarine, the Type 218SG, hears and senses a cacophony of chatter. Not of people, but of the 2,000 ships that sail through the Singapore Strait every day. “Many of the boats in the world are not designed for such environments: Warm, shallow, noisy, crowded,” RSN’s head of naval operations Cheong Kwok Chien told Channel NewsAsia in an exclusive interview on Saturday (Jun 30). “The operating environment makes a lot of difference to a submariner, and if you design a boat meant for this type of environment, you can make a lot of difference to whoever you’re up against.” And so the RSN searched all over the world for a submarine that could replace its ageing Archer-class and Challenger-class predecessors. A submarine that could truly be made for Singapore from scratch. “We’ve operated second-hands for 20 years,” Rear-Admiral (RADM) Cheong said of the retrofitted Swedish submarines. “Over 20 years, we’ve built up knowledge of what a submarine would be that’s designed for local waters.” In the ​​​​​​​end the Germans, masters of the submarine craft, “offered the best deal” in terms of technology, logistics, training and knowledge exchange. It has been reported that the contract for the first two Type 218SGs is worth more than 1 billion euros (S$1.6 billion). The deal clincher? “The Germans were also very willing to listen to our requirements and change a lot of the original design to suit what we need in our waters,” RADM Cheong said. The manufacturer, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), also prepared high-resolution, virtual reality goggles for Singapore officials to put on and “walk” through the submarine, allowing them to tweak even the smallest details. “We can actually know the ergonomics,” RADM Cheong said. “For a Singaporean’s height, can I reach the top? We could also make the pathways smaller and put more equipment because we are smaller in size.” The Defence Ministry said Singapore will get four Type 218SGs, with delivery from 2021. The programme is “progressing well”, with the first two and remaining two submarines having commenced construction and steel-cutting, respectively. LIGHTING UP THE UNDERWATER WORLD But perhaps the most crucial customisations are in the Type 218SG’s combat system. Its improved sonar, which listens to sounds like propeller noises and water flow, locates enemies faster and identifies them more accurately. “That’s when digital audio recognition comes in. We will hear frequency, sound wave profiles, and compare to known sounds that we have,” RADM Cheong said. “That basically helps us light up the underwater world.” With the waters around Singapore so shallow and congested, the Type 218SG can tell whether it’s facing a merchant ship, cruise liner or warship better than RSN’s current submarines. “It’s like going into a disco and picking up the sweetest voice,” RADM Cheong added. “You need to be quite capable. If not you will be blasted, and in our environment everybody gets blasted.” Once the target is locked on, then come the torpedoes. A Type 218SG model that TKMS had displayed at an exhibition last year indicated that the submarine will be fitted with eight forward-firing torpedo tubes for heavyweight torpedoes. The \"big improvement\", however, lies in the submarine’s electronics and computers that enable fewer crew members to do more with the weapons. “If you watch the old war movies, it’s a whole bunch of people trying to hear (the enemy) then get the torpedo ready; there’s a whole lot of activity on the boat,” RADM Cheong said. “No, what we are going for now is one guy pressing a button to release the torpedo.” Another improvement is the Type 218SG’s air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which RADM Cheong said is more efficient than the one in the Archer-class submarine. The AIP allows submarines to stay underwater longer before surfacing to recharge the battery that powers its systems. The battery is charged by a diesel engine that needs air to operate. As such, the Type 218SG can last underwater two times longer than RSN’s current submarines. “That makes the submarine even more stealthy and mysterious because it can be all over the place without coming up,” RADM Cheong said. SHIP KILLERS This stealth is what makes the Type 218SG so lethal, as RADM Cheong spoke in broad terms about how the submarines fit into RSN’s overall strategy. “All over the world, submarines are what we call strategic capabilities,” he said. “Because they are stealthy, can go to a lot of places and deliver a very impactful strike. So, most navies will use the submarine to deliver these effects.” Besides hunting ships, submarines can do surveillance, deliver special forces, unmanned underwater vehicles and high-end weapons like nuclear missiles. “Sometimes, you have to strike at the Achilles heel of the adversary, somewhere he thinks he’s quite safe and doesn’t expect anybody to come,” RADM Cheong said, highlighting the “psychological threat” a submarine poses. When RSN’s submariners go for exercises, they typically train in some of these skills. “It makes all the seagoers, especially people on ships, quite fearful because you don’t know where it is,” RADM Cheong added. “Surface ships dislike submarines a lot, because most egos are broken by submariners.” In a one-on-one situation with conventional warships, RADM Cheong stated that submarines “always win”. “When the submarine hears you, with the range that it shoots, there’s not much you can do about it.” INVISIBLE, NOT INVINCIBLE However, submarines are not invincible. RADM Cheong pointed out that they lack speed and are prone to being spotted when they surface. \"So, these are inherent vulnerabilities,” he added. “Fast things and aircraft hunt submarines. To hunt a submarine, you must operate out of its element. If you operate in water, you must be something that it cannot or doesn’t want to kill.\" One example of a low-value target is an unmanned underwater vessel. Nevertheless, RADM Cheong said a good submariner can remain undetected if he knows where to position the vessel in relation to how sound waves travel underwater. “If he exploits all these black holes underwater, nobody can hear him and he can hear everybody else,” he added. “He can be quite silent and maybe even invisible.” For the Type 218SG, RSN’s submariners will train in simulators and abroad with their German counterparts, who RADM Cheong described as some of the best in the world. “They like to have a worthy partner to spar with,” he said. “We also take this opportunity to learn from them.” BMW FOR SINGAPORE ROADS RADM Cheong said the Germans were also grateful that the RSN wanted to fully customise its submarine, pointing out that they gained “a lot of interesting insights”. “They said not many customers are so forthcoming in saying that this doesn’t work.” To that end, RADM Cheong said the Type 218SG answers a lot of challenges. “German submarines are like BMWs, so we are very glad we decided on this class of submarine,” he added. “This new build is designed for Singapore roads, tailored to our ergonomics, size and driving range. Even the horn sounds better.” The RSN also ensured that the internal systems, like the engine and electronics, were cost-efficient and maximised the crew’s capabilities. “On board, every submariner you bring is a huge investment,” RADM Cheong said. “So in terms of combat fighting, you want the submarine to be able to do a lot but not by putting in a lot of people.” RADM Cheong said this is crucial to tackle the “ever-present” threat of terrorism at sea with an increasingly constrained manpower base. The saying is that one US aircraft carrier carries more people than the number of active personnel the RSN has. “Almost everything that we wear, eat and the energy that we consume every day comes through the sea,” he added. “So, what the Navy has done is to look at this environment and recognise that we need to defend our lifelines.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/submarines-like-bmws-a-closer-look-at-the-navy-s-newest-custom-10488374"}, {"datetime": "01 Jul 2018 06:54PM", "tags": ["Singapore Police Force", "counter-terrorism", "Pulau Ubin"], "author": "", "title": "Counter-terrorism exercise held at Pulau Ubin", "content": " SINGAPORE: The sound of gunshots broke the tranquility of Pulau Ubin on Sunday (Jul 1) morning.

It is located about five minutes from Sembawang MRT station. Bukit Canberra will also see the largest ActiveSG gym with indoor and outdoor pools. There will also be 3km of running trails as well as a fruit orchard and healthcare options such as a polyclinic and senior care centre.  And to help visitors learn more about the area’s past, heritage story boards will be set up around Bukit Canberra detailing the area as a former naval base, and its historic structures including the Former Admiralty House that used to accommodate key military commanders based in Singapore.  Speaking at a family carnival to mark the start of construction works, Minister for Education and Adviser to Sembawang GRC Grassroots Organisations Ong Ye Kung said the project is one that residents have been waiting for, for a long time.  “Bukit Canberra is both a historical treasure and the brainchild of our residents. We have been engaging Sembawang residents since 2016 to co-create a vibrant gathering place for our residents and families.  \"The general consensus was to conserve the greenery as much as possible, and at the same time put in place useful facilities that the community finds most useful,” he said.  Mr Ong was joined by fellow advisers Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister of Transport Khaw Boon Wan, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Vikram Nair as well as some 800 residents.  At the event, the Grassroots Advisers also planted a Sembawang Tree, which will be part of the 1,600 additional trees that will be planted at Bukit Canberra.

Expected to take shape in about five years, it will be the heart of commercial, leisure and recreational activities - with authorities hoping this can attract more businesses and talent to support future growth.  The gateway to the city centre will be located next to the Nankai Station of the upcoming Z4 rail line, which connects the eco-city to Beijing, Tianjin City and the rest of the Tianjin Binhai New Area.  Completion of the rail line is expected in 2020 and the city centre will also feature a bus interchange. A plaza at the gateway will be framed by two iconic office towers which, standing at more than 150m, will be the tallest buildings in the eco-city.  There will also be business hotels and residential buildings, as well as convention and exhibition facilities located nearby.  In line with its vision of being a “Green Smart Hub”, the city centre will be a smart, low carbon footprint central business district.  Besides sky gardens and terraces, there are plans to introduce smart bus stops, as well as driverless cars and bicycles to promote the use of green transport.  A 1.2km pedestrian street will take residents and visitors from the gateway plaza through shopping streets, which will be designed with Tianjin cultural elements.  This will also lead them to the two major attractions of the city centre - the Sino-Singapore Friendship Garden, which will have a tropical greenhouse that showcases Singapore’s “City in a Garden” concept and the Sino-Singapore Friendship Library, which will be the largest library in the eco-city.  Along the way, the building heights will dip, with the design not only forming an iconic skyline but also allowing for unblocked views to the waterfront.  Eco-city residents Channel NewsAsia spoke to welcomed the latest development.  “I think it’s good. We are lacking these facilities in the eco-city at the moment. We need something like this,” said Mr Hu Jinze, who moved into the eco-city two years ago.  Another resident, who wanted to only be known as Ms Bu, added that this would save her the hassle of driving at least 30 to 40 minutes to the Tianjin Economic-Development Area if she wanted to visit a bigger store to shop.  “If the stores are right at my doorstep, it would be so convenient and I don’t have to waste my time on the road anymore,” she said.  SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TIANJIN ECO-CITY AND LORONG HALUS Marking the next phase of development, Singapore National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and Tianjin Binhai New Area Party Secretary Zhang Yuzhuo officiated the launch of the city centre in Tianjin Eco-City itself on Sunday.  This was also witnessed by Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean who is on a nine-day visit to China.  “Our urban planners from the Urban Redevelopment Authority have contributed valuable ideas to the design team in the conceptualisation of the city centre, bringing to the table their rich experience in urban planning and place making,” said Mr Wong. “Close collaboration has always been key to the eco-city project, and thus, the ‘Singapore DNA’ will also come through strongly in the city centre.”  Mr Teo noted that Tianjin Eco-City is one of Singapore’s most important projects in China and there’s great satisfaction in seeing how far it has come in the last 10 years.  “Today we launched the city centre, rail lines are coming in. I think the eco-city is at a point of take-off,” said Mr Teo.  “But I think the most important point is to see how it can be replicated and scaled for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei new area and also to see how the experiences can be taken to other places beyond China as well.” Mr Wong also noted that there are similarities between the transformation of Tianjin Eco-City, which was built on once barren, polluted land, and Singapore’s Lorong Halus, which was previously a dumping ground for waste. “So in many ways we are learning from each other,” said Mr Wong.  “We have exported and brought our experience to Tianjin but the work we do in Tianjin has also given us fresh perspectives and we have also brought some of these things to Singapore in our own urban plans.”  The entire eco-city project spans 30 sq km and aims to be a role model for sustainable development.  The number of people living or working in the eco-city has gone up by about four times - from 20,000 in 2014, to over 80,000 now.  There are also about 6,500 registered companies in the eco-city with a total registered capital of about US$33 billion.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tianjin-eco-city-to-develop-new-central-district-city-centre-10487778"}, {"datetime": "01 Jul 2018 10:04AM", "tags": ["accident", "Woodlands Checkpoint"], "author": "", "title": "2 injured in accident at Woodlands Checkpoint involving 4 cars", "content": " SINGAPORE: An accident at Woodlands Checkpoint early on Sunday (Jul 1) morning involving four cars caused the departure viaduct at the facility to be temporarily closed.

And mother of five Ethel Lim is the field marshal, waking up and directing her troop of teens and pre-teens. She has 40 minutes to get her children, aged between 10 and 16, in and out of the toilet they share and out of their apartment in time for school. This means she would need everything to run like clockwork. What the 37-year-old would usually get is chaos, with lots of knocking on the toilet door. Her second daughter Bernice attested that the mornings could be “very crazy”. “Each one of us only has five minutes in the bathroom, so we can only brush our teeth, wash our face and change our clothes,” said the 15-year-old. “Sometimes one of us gets to school late because somebody woke up late, then (got ready) very slowly.” Mrs Lim would receive complaints from school, usually about 14-year-old Ambrosia, her middle child and “the late one”. Her reply? “I have five kids to ferry.” Despite the trend here towards having fewer children, a few families like the Lims have gone against the grain. The programme On The Red Dot spent months filming three large families (by today's standards), to see what it takes to raise a big brood in Singapore today. (Watch the series here.) MARRIED AT 19 In the case of the Lims, they did not plan specifically for five children; rather, husband Nick wanted a big family, “so we just went ahead”, said Mrs Lim, who was similarly inclined because “maybe the noisier the better”. She got her wish, with five different personalities – “monsters”, she calls them – fighting for space in the rented condominium penthouse shared with her husband’s sister, a domestic helper and two dogs. Mrs Lim was 19 years old when she got married after dating for six months, while her husband was 25. She still gets asked about tying the knot at that age, and her reply is no different from what she said back then to her friends, who had wondered if it was a shotgun marriage. (It was not.) “I found the right guy; the chemistry’s there, the sparks were there, he’s good. Okay, let’s go for it,” she said, adding that her parents were supportive because he treated her well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Two years later, she had her first child, Crystal, followed by the next two girls – each of them a year apart. Her son Bryan is now 12, and she had her youngest daughter, Melody, by the time she was 27. She was a part-time real estate agent previously, and has been a stay-at-home mum since her second pregnancy – a role that has kept her contented as she watched her children grow up. “My family are my top priority, so they’re my happiness. I don’t think anything is a sacrifice for my family,” she said. SPACE CRUNCH She found her children easier to handle, however, when they were younger. Now they are more vocal and have growing needs. It has proven to be a challenge satisfying one demand in particular. Said Mrs Lim: “All of them request, 'I want my own personal space.’” In their maisonette of about five years, Bernice, Bryan and Melody have been sleeping in the master bedroom with their parents, while Crystal and Ambrosia have been sharing a room, with the helper and their aunt in the third bedroom. But it is not only the sleeping arrangements that have been a squeeze. Finding space to study at home in peace is also not easy when their other siblings are playing noisily, as they often do. This year, it has been particularly difficult for Crystal, who is taking the N-level examinations and is working hard to qualify for the direct polytechnic admission programme. “I wish that they give me more privacy and a proper space to study,” said the 16-year-old. Just last year, there was a comfortable study room in the apartment. But it was filled with boxes packed in November in anticipation of a move to a new, bigger home. Those plans were then derailed by Mr Lim’s work schedule, to Crystal’s chagrin. “I argued with (my parents) a lot about this,” she said. I don’t want anything to affect my N-level results, which are very important to me. That focus of hers has meant that she has been spending more time with her friends instead. “When I go out with them, I get to study, so in a sense, I get to do stuff that’s more productive,” she explained. WATCH: Space crunch for this family of 9 (Dur 4:27)  ‘I WISH HE’D BE THERE’ Mr Lim felt bad about the delay in moving house caused by his work. He is in township development and makes business visits in the region almost every week. He is gone for about three to five days each time and two weeks at the longest, although he tries to be back for the weekends, and he calls his family every night. Owing to his increasing workload, “it was harder to find the right house for my family”, he said. But that is not the only reason his children are growing impatient with his absence. He also missed Ambrosia’s and Bernice’s birthdays. “They were very upset,” said Crystal. “Working is important, but then I know that time is also very valuable, and what you miss you can’t get back. Sometimes I wish that he’d be more fatherly, that he’d actually be there.” But this “can’t be helped”, said Mr Lim, whose pay depends on his commission and who earns S$10,000 to S$20,000 a month to support his family and give them a “better future”. “As long as a parent isn’t around, like me, there’d definitely be this (feeling of neglecting them),” he admitted. “But as of now, my family environment still allows me to go out (of Singapore) to work. “The market is larger outside … Wherever gives me better development, I’d go. I was never worried about going to places others don’t want to go to – I’m only worried about having no work.” To make up for lost time, whenever he is in Singapore, he drives his children to school. It is the best way for him to spend time with them. ‘MY GREATEST WORRY’ Mrs Lim knows that her husband is “a caring dad”, but he is inexpressive and quiet. “So most of the time, I’m the one doing all the talking with the kids,” she said. Her husband’s absence or his relationship with their children, however, is not her biggest concern. “My greatest worry is Bryan. His PSLE,” she declared. Her Primary 6 son seems to be more interested in playing – or fighting – with his siblings than in his coming examinations. Said his mother: “He doesn’t really bother about his studies, but I can’t push him … because the more you push him, the more he doesn’t want (to listen).” Growing up dyslexic and recently diagnosed with hearing difficulties, Bryan has been struggling in school. And in a family of seven, it has been hard to devote attention and resources to just one child. “We did try giving them tuition. It did help, but it’s quite costly, so we cut down,” Mrs Lim said. “Nick and I are still … working out with teachers – taking (their) advice – how to handle him. “But he’s a very stubborn boy, and he keeps everything to himself, so it’s kind of hard to get him to open up.” His parents only want him to pass his subjects, but in his recent report card, he passed only his English out of three subjects. “I did try, but … I always end up with only a few more marks (needed) to pass,” said the 12-year-old, who had to then promise his parents that he would do better or else they would take away his phone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PARENTING ISSUES While Mrs Lim hopes that her son will now strive to do better this term, that ultimatum to him is the nearest approach to being a discipline mistress that her children would see from her. Having had her children at a young age, she prefers to be more of a friend than a mother. And she doubts that caning them really works, since she herself became “more rebellious” when she was caned in the past. She reasoned: If you’re doing the ‘mother’ role, (children) won’t tell you a lot of things. Rather, when you’re friends with them, they can tell you a lot of things. But her lenient parenting approach does not always work, thinks Crystal. “(My siblings) talk back to her without any consideration of the situation,” said the girl. “They should show her more respect and care instead of just arguing all the way without a valid point.” Indeed, there are some things about having a family of seven that do drive Mrs Lim crazy. “Sometimes they’d argue non-stop for a few days or throw tantrums,” she said. “Mostly it’s the children fighting.” That is when she needs a break from them – and a chance to catch up with her best friend Kristine Khoo, whom she has known for about five to six years. “Talking to Kristine makes me more relaxed because she’s a mum herself, and our kids of the same age. So we understand each other more,” said Mrs Lim. MOVING HOUSE One of her biggest reliefs, however, came recently when her husband found a new home for them after months of house-hunting: A three-storey terrace house with five rooms. And it has been an exciting time for the family as they went about cleaning their rooms before the big move. “My husband did a very good job finding this place,” said a happy Mrs Lim. Their children must still share a room, but there is now an adjoining toilet for each. “I don’t have to queue up! I don’t need to wait for all them!” exclaimed Crystal. On the other hand, one of the reasons her mother is thankful they have their own space is that, for the first time since the birth of her first child, she and husband may just be left \"very peaceful” at night. “It’s no more noise at night, no more calling them to sleep,” she said with a laugh – even if waking them up in the morning may be no less difficult.

But instead of packing an energy bar for that added boost, he stashes something more essential - an extra stoma bag. \"I can always steal some food from the others!\" he told Channel NewsAsia with a laugh. A rectal cancer survivor, Mr Mathiyan has had to rely on the stoma bag to collect his stools through an artificially created hole in his abdomen since an operation seven years ago. He has to wear a bag for the rest of his life, and carries an extra piece with him daily in case of emergencies. But that doesn't get in the way of the sprightly 59-year-old, who walks an average of 10km a day, swims regularly, goes dragon-boating and counts line-dancing as well as zumba among his other regular activities. \"When I tell people I have a stoma bag, they say 'are you sure? You must be kidding',\" said Mr Mathiyan. Mr Mathiyan, along with 16 others, will next month trek a combined 1,700km in the Gobi Desert to raise funds for the Singapore Cancer Society. \"It is about challenging myself. I will be 60 next year, so if not now then when? I still have all my faculties about me and I'm fit. And of course, it's for a good cause - raising money for cancer - which is a big part of what I do,\" added Mr Mathiyan. Mr Mathiyan has dedicated much of his time to helping those struggling with cancer. He is a volunteer leader in the Colorectal Cancer Support Group at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), chairman of the Semi-Colons Support Group at the Singapore Cancer Society, as well as one of the founding members of the Ostomy Association of Singapore, a non-profit organisation that also provides support for people with similar conditions. \"Whatever I'm doing now, it gives me sense of fulfillment,\" he added.  \"It is as important to me as it is going to be for whoever I'm helping. There's also some 'selfish aspect' to what I'm doing.  I feel good doing these things - it's a big part of my life that I do this.\" So committed to the cause is Mr Mathiyan, a manager at a metal recycling company, that he turned down a full-time position at the firm he currently works at, in order to spend more time volunteering. \"I said I really wanted to do this so I couldn't do a full-time job,\" he said. \"My employer, who is also one of my friends, noticed this change in me. He said that I'm looking a lot happier and that I'm enjoying my life.  And so he understood, and agreed readily to it.\" BOUNCING BACK FROM A 'TRIPLE WHAMMY' Mr Mathiyan, who was diagnosed with rectal and testicular cancer in 2011, has vivid memories of his cancer journey. \"There was initial shock, numbness and devastation, after the doctor told me the news,\" he said. \"But what else was there to do? I chose to stay positive and I knew that would help my recovery. \"Most people ask 'Why me?' I couldn't - because I checked all the boxes. I smoked, I drank, I had an unhealthy lifestyle, I was overweight. There was nobody to blame. I had friends who led absolutely healthy lifestyles and had cancer. Then they could ask 'Why me?'\" Mr Mathiyan had to undergo surgery to remove the cancerous tumor along with his rectum. It was during a pre-surgery scan that doctors noticed a lump on the right side of his groin. \"The urologist came in and said 'There's a lump there, it looks pretty suspicious, do you want us to remove it?' At that point they didn't know that it was malignant or cancerous - it was just a lump,\" Mr Mathiyan noted. \"I said why not? You buy one, you get one free.\" Days after the successful surgery came the bad news. The lump was malignant. \"My immediate reaction wasn't as bad as the first time but I felt like a triple whammy had hit me - having the rectal cancer, a stoma, and now I have testicular cancer.\" Twenty-eight sessions of radiation treatment and eight cycles of chemotherapy later, Mr Mathiyan said the doctors declared him cancer-free in late December 2011. \"The treatment messes up your system. There's lethargy, irritability, diarrhoea and so on,\" Mr Mathiyan recalled. \"The only thing good about the colorectal cancer drug is that it doesn't make you lose your hair. But of course, I didn't have an issue before that,\" he said with a wry grin. He added: \"Relief was the overriding emotion when I was told I was cancer-free. Relief also because I didn't have to undergo the treatment anymore and (feel) the side effects.\" Mr Mathiyan attributes a large part of his recovery to support from the people around him - his wife and a best friend - as well as his employer. The \"turning point\" during the journey though, Mr Mathiyan said, was his discovering of the support groups, first from the UK and then in SGH. \"Number one, I was not alone. Number two, I also realised that there are a lot of people out there who need help,\" he said.  The Gobi trek marks yet another chance for  Mr Mathiyan to give back.  Organised by expedition leader Scott Tay, the founder of boutique travel agency Beyond Expeditions SG, the group will spend six days trekking a section of Asia's second-largest desert.  The group is made up of cancer survivors, caregivers, SCS charity athletes and other individuals from all walks of life. They aim to raise S$100,000 for the SCS. While it has been almost seven and a half years since he was diagnosed, there still remains a possibility of a relapse, said Mr Mathiyan. \"I don't know if it is going to come back - it might. I am mentally prepared. If it comes, we will deal with it. \"Right now, there is an element of uncertainty as to how long I'm going to live,\" he added. \"So every new day becomes very important - every day that I wake up is a bonus. So what am I going to do with the rest of the time that I have?  I can just live, do whatever I want to do and have fun. Or I can reach out to people and do something very useful.\" And that is what Mr Mathiyan aims to do in the Gobi Desert with the rest of the team - one step at a time.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/double-cancer-survivor-to-trek-gobi-desert-10474798"}, {"datetime": "01 Jul 2018 06:40AM", "tags": ["housing", "HDB", "CPF", "ageing population"], "author": "Tan Jin Meng", "title": "Commentary: Can shifting the emphasis to renting help solve Singapore’s public housing puzzle?", "content": " SINGAPORE: With significant CPF funds being funnelled to housing, and a substantial reason why Singaporeans' retirement savings may be inadequate, Singapore needs to consider that housing and retirement security are two sides of the same coin.  We need to look at other ways to unlock housing equity in a way that resolves the conundrum of the ageing flat and gives home owners adequate retirement funding without disrupting the property market which so many Singaporeans rely on as a source of wealth. LEASEHOLD PROPERTY NOT REALLY THE PROBLEM The finite land tenure system in Singapore is hardly unique. In Hong Kong, virtually all land is under leasehold, most with terms of 75 or 99 years.  In Japan, residential land leases of 50 years can be found in urban centres. House prices adjust accordingly. Citizens there generally do not expect the government to swoop in and rescue them when their leases expire. When new HDB flats are sold with 99-year leases, nearly all Singaporeans benefit up front. At the end of the minimum occupation period, resale prices are almost invariably much higher than the purchase price.  The home owner has also paid for their housing up front, in effect inflation proofing their housing needs – important when house prices are rising. READ: 99-year HDB leases a chance to review home ownership and retirement policies, a commentary. READ: An over-emphasis on home ownership can come at a cost to society, a commentary. READ: Singapore's public housing has done its job splendidly. Maybe it's time for a make-over, a commentary. The Government also gives an assortment of housing grants to encourage various social goals in housing. The subsidised upgrading programme, present since the 1990s, is also another source of redistribution. HDB flats may be harder to sell when their leases get shorter, due mainly to restrictions on CPF withdrawals, and the reluctance of banks to lend for houses of short leases.  There is nothing inherently bad about a limited land tenure system. However, given that homeowners expect their leasehold properties to retain their value or appreciate, it is worth reviewing the challenges on the horizon. HUGE SUPPLY OF FLATS WITH SHORT-TERM LEASES There are two looming supply issues – an ageing population and the limited leasehold of HDB flats. You create supply if you sell your flat and move in with your children. When you downgrade from a 90 sq m flat to a 35 sq m flat, you are “creating” a net 55 sq m of housing. When you sign onto a lease buyback with the HDB, you are creating extra future supply. If you pass away, and leave your flat as a bequest, you also create supply. So we can expect a huge supply of flats with shorter leases in the future but it is unclear if they will have demand.  DEMAND FOR SUCH FLATS LIKELY TO REMAIN MUTED Why? For one, banks are reluctant to lend money to individuals to buy properties with short leases. There are restrictions on CPF withdrawal to purchase short-leasehold housing. Second, prospective home owners may also be reluctant to own short-leasehold housing even if the price is right and funding is available. Third, Singapore’s resident population may shrink over the long term. Singapore’s fertility has been below replacement rate since the 1970s and is currently hovering slightly over 1 child per woman’s lifetime. A mitigating factor is that the economy of the future might have more workers with intermittent income, or who need to conserve their capital for risk taking. In such a case, renting might make more sense. DEVELOP A RESIDENTIAL REIT MARKET A 4-room flat in Toa Payoh with 54 years left can rent out for S$2,000 a month, a potential S$1.3 million in cashflow through the remaining life of the flat, if you ignore both inflation (which increases it) and discounting (which decreases it). This suggests that an ability to unlock the full economic value of a flat through rental is possible, even with older flats. While flats with short leases may be hard to monetise through selling at present, a residential REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) can mitigate this by providing a market for such flats. A REIT addresses concerns with funding flat purchases because it will have access to international and domestic investors, the bond market and bank lending that individuals do not. These stakeholders do not care so much about individual leasehold tenures, but the average characteristics of the housing portfolio. A REIT run by professional managers will also adhere to regulations, including any conditions placed by the HDB on public housing. Ownership of REIT shares represent a participation in the residential housing market that is liquid and in any fractional amount desired. They may be a better route to housing as an investment than buying a house. A householder can choose to downgrade but still participate in any upside in housing by accepting part of the proceeds in REIT shares. It is possible that one of the reasons for the unpopularity of the Silver Housing Bonus and Lease BuyBack schemes is that home owners expect they will lose out of any future housing market appreciation.  Giving them shares in a residential REIT, instead of depositing proceeds in the CPF retirement account could be an attractive option for some. Restrictions can be placed on the sale of shares, to prevent owners from selling and cashing them out early. The residential REIT should be allowed to own older HDB flats, purpose-built rental apartments, and private property. New rental apartments will increase the average tenure of the portfolio and its attractiveness. This will encourage both domestic and international investors looking for an alternative way to participate in housing investment. ENCOURAGING RENTAL DEMAND The extra rental supply will need extra rental demand. The Government should seed the rental market by building well-designed, decent housing in good locations and with good amenities specifically for rental purposes. The mix of flat sizes should be chosen to maximise mixing of all socio-economic types. Existing rental flats for the low income should be gradually retired in favour of giving cash vouchers for low-income families to rent. This will encourage social inclusion and allow families to choose the best possible location for their budget, and family or work circumstance. The Government could allow CPF to be withdrawn for housing only after a certain balance is achieved in the special account. Cash Vouchers could be provided for young families, with insufficient special account balances, to rent transitional housing. This has a secondary purpose of ensuring a good CPF balance for young families before they start to own property, as well as to improve their retirement security. A good CPF balance at the beginning of one’s working life is more beneficial given the benefits of compounding interest. For example, S$25,000 in one’s special account compounding over 30 years with current CPF interest rates becomes can reach S$101,000. This accumulation would be even more significant for lower middle-income families. S$25,000 is not hard to accumulate if you top up your special account from your ordinary account balances. With a S$1,500 monthly salary, one only requires five years to accumulate that balance. Addressing the challenge of how ageing HDB flats can retain their value so that homeowners can monetise their homes for retirement income in a way that doesn’t disrupt the property market is an imperative for Singapore. More ideas will be needed so that Singaporeans can have a constructive discussion about the future of public housing. ​​​​​​​Tan Jin Meng is a postgraduate from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy with an interest in social policy and economics.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/shifting-emphasis-to-renting-solve-public-housing-issue-10482470"}, {"datetime": "01 Jul 2018 06:40AM", "tags": ["Edwin Tong", "Kong Hee", "City Harvest Church", "Politics", "2011 Election"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Politics, the City Harvest Church saga and regaining the public’s trust: Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong goes On the Record", "content": " SINGAPORE: “I don’t make any apologies for that. I would do it again.”  That's what lawyer and newly appointed Senior Minister of State for Law and Health Edwin Tong says when asked about defending the founder of City Harvest Church (CHC) Kong Hee in a legal case that captured the public’s attention. The marathon case, one of the longest-running trials in Singapore’s legal history, involved the misuse of S$50 million in church funds and lasted from May 2010 till early this year.  Mr Tong, 48 and MP for the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency (GRC), was appointed Senior Minister of State for Law and Health in the Cabinet reshuffle earlier this year.  About a week before taking on the role, he sat down with me to look back on his legal and political career.  While he made headlines for his new political appointment, he was mentioned in the media more often while he was handling the CHC case.  As with many high-profile legal cases, the lawyers representing the defendants came under fire and Mr Tong, being an integral part of the CHC defence team, was no exception. “People make rude comments about me being the 'City Harvest lawyer'. It’s regarded as not something that a PAP Member of Parliament (MP) or senior lawyer should be doing. But it’s my job. The case came to the firm and I was asked to take it on.  \"Even (Law) Minister K Shanmugam says that everyone deserves a chance to have a legal representation of his choice and that’s something in our constitution. So, if we back down because people criticise the lawyers who are taking on these jobs, then I think our society and our rule of law will be all the poorer,” he says steadfastly. To listen to the full interview, click here. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST? In February this year, the Government said it believed the sentences meted out to those convicted in the case were too low. Law Minister K Shanmugam said the issue would be looked into to ensure that legislation provides for higher penalties for senior officers who commit criminal breaches of trust (CBT). He was reflecting the Government's position on the apex court’s decision to uphold shorter jail terms for CHC founder Kong Hee and five other former church leaders. This resulted from a new interpretation of the Penal Code section governing CBT offences, which led to the Court of Appeal ruling that company directors, governing board members or key officers of charities and officers of societies who commit CBT could be jailed up to seven years - compared to employees being liable for a maximum 15 years imprisonment. Some members of the public then wondered why Mr Tong, who was then the deputy chair of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Home Affairs and Law, hadn’t brought up the gap in the law to the Government earlier. Was his position as defence lawyer conflicting with his position as member of the GPC and MP? “Firstly, there’s a flaw in the law because the law was not changed from many years ago,\" he says. \"I was focused on what the legal provisions were. The legal provisions would require that the level of sentencing could not exceed a certain level. The charges had already been made by then. You can’t change legislation and apply it ex post facto. Whatever one might point out or not point out, the law as it stood at the time of the offenses were crystallised, would apply. So it would not have made a difference to my case.” But would he have been more likely to point out the gap in the law himself if he hadn’t been a defence lawyer handling the CHC case? “I and all my colleagues saw the gap and we argued it early on. We pointed out that the provision the prosecution sought to use was inappropriate, that in fact, the right provision should have been the one several notches lower and that would necessarily mean that even if there was a conviction, the penalty could not exceed a certain level.  \"That argument was premised on showing that there was a gap. It was an argument that was dismissed, partly because there was a High Court judgment that the Subordinate Court felt that they were bound by and so we accepted it.” He believes such details did not make the headlines as much because the public’s attention was focused on the “more sensational aspects” of the case. I wonder if he ever faces a moral dilemma when defending those accused of harsh crimes. “I am fortunate in being able to separate moral dilemma from professional responsibility quite well. The fact that I seldom taken on criminal cases probably makes that easier.   \"As a lawyer, I present the facts as they are instructed to me. I make the best of those facts using legal authority and arguments, and it is for the court to assess if there has been wrongdoing. I don’t start off knowing or presuming there is wrongdoing, but if I am being asked by the client to take a false position or suppress material, then I will not carry on.” I ask if he is at all concerned that his role as a defence lawyer - especially as Kong Hee’s lawyer - has affected his political standing among the electorate. “I can’t discount it. I hope it will not but if it has, I just have to live with it, get on with it. “Beyond doing what I do as a lawyer with all the right safeguards, checks and balances in place and as long as you don’t compromise on your ethics as a lawyer, what are those higher standards? Are you suggesting that a PAP MP who is also a lawyer should not act for criminals? Or are you suggesting a PAP MP who is also a doctor should not be treating a criminal? What are those standards? Why do we draw that line artificially?” Mr Tong has been a lawyer since 1995 and his areas of practice include corporate and commercial disputes, and international arbitration. It’s something he will miss as he steps down from his position as Senior Counsel at law firm Allen & Gledhill to take on the role of Senior Minister of State. “I’ve been used to being on my feet in court. I enjoy the cut and thrust of being in court and dealing with my clients. But at some stage there will always be some transition to be made and I’m looking forward to the challenge.” THE 2011 ELECTION: “THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF COMPLACENCY” He was MP for Moulmein-Kallang GRC till 2015, before he was elected MP for Marine Parade GRC. His first election was in 2011. Many analysts described this as a watershed election. The PAP garnered 81 of the 87 seats. However, its share of the valid votes cast dropped from the 66.6 per cent in the 2006 election to 60.1 per cent. The opposition Workers’ Party retained its Hougang seat and captured the five-seat Aljunied GRC, the first time that an opposition party managed to win a GRC since the system was introduced in 1988. I ask Mr Tong what it was like to be fielded for the first time in such an election. “I was a complete newbie at that point. I worked the ground through grassroots work for a while but never in the hustle and bustle of the hustings. To be honest, in 2011, I had perhaps a rose-tinted view of what a PAP candidate would be facing. I went in it thinking this is the PAP team. We had done well over the years and it would be all things as per normal. “It really took me a couple of days on the ground in the campaign to realise that it’s really not what I thought it was going to be and it was a lot harder. The pushback I got from a lot of the residents I went to see was a lot tougher than I expected. The tone of voice, general sentiment and body-language became noticeably hostile.  That’s when I realised that actually the sentiment, the sense that Singaporeans were being marginalised in our own country, squeezed out of the MRT, literally and figuratively, were real.” But why had he not sensed it while carrying out his grassroots work before the election? Had he not himself felt the growing unhappiness in a changing Singapore? “I think perhaps my radar was not as attuned. I did realise that there were grouses, and there was unhappiness over certain policies but I didn't put it all together in the same way I did shortly into the hustings.” Eventually, his team in Moulmein-Kallang garnered 58.56 per cent of the total votes cast. “I would say there was quite a bit of complacency. The realisation didn't come home until 2011. We described it as watershed, but I think it’s a bit more than that.  \"It’s also about the voting population growing up and realising that they do have a voice and they should exercise that voice. I think that’s how a properly functioning democracy should work. If something is not working out for the country and for the population, they have to speak up and the Government has to react. It needs to find the right responses.” SOCIAL TRANSFERS  - A POPULIST MOVE? However, he cautions the Government against being populist in its efforts to win the hearts and minds of voters. “When then-Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam announced social transfers – GST Vouchers, U-Save rebates, the Silver Support Scheme and other policies - I did feel that it was unprecedented and a slippery slope and it was too much of a reaction to what the ground sentiments were. “I’ve seen the experiences of the Western countries where the more you give, the more one asks and I think that’s really the start of the erosion of the work ethic that Singaporeans have. Once we start giving, we can’t scale back. You look at our country. We have nothing but our people. If we erode the competency of the workforce and we introduce a policy that undermines the work ethic, I think that’s going to be a big problem for us as a country.” But really, is Singapore even close to being in that situation? Some analysts and members of the public feel the Government can afford to do even more. “When I look back now, I realise why those transfers were needed, but I still think it must be done judiciously. If you want some social support, I think you’ve got to show that you’re getting yourself to where you should be and not just sitting on the street and expecting the handouts to come. I think that’s something that’s fundamental in our society. “I’m not sure about the assumption that giving people social transfers and handouts is the way to level up and decrease inequality and increase mobility. It’s one way, but I would say it’s only a small part of the equation. One has to really look at society and how you lift society up through education, for example. I do believe in that.  \"The education system has its flaws now where you have students from richer families thriving over the less well-to-do. I accept all that and I think that should be managed better. But at the end of the day, education and the way we look at our jobs are all sharper tools than just giving a handout.” However, he feels how the Government determines the amount of social transfers accorded to households can be improved to ensure that resources are directed more accurately. It is an issue he has raised in Parliament before.  “Means-testing should be a lot more detailed than it is today. Today, they look at your address for example and if you live in a private estate, you’re out. One may have a home that is bought in the 60s. It might be worth more now, but you can’t expect an old couple to sell their home and live on that in a different estate where they’re dislocated from their own friends and society.” I put it to him that even though dislocation can be hard to deal with, surely the Government can’t be giving finite resources to those who own million-dollar or multi-million dollar homes at the expense of those who might not be able to afford a modest home or even a meal. He concedes this argument is “fair enough”. “But what about those who live in private estates, but are squatting with their siblings or with a friend. They may not be paying rent but they are there on goodwill and the goodwill could end at any point. So I think we should be more granular on it, go beyond just the address, go beyond just what the income is. What about those with dependants who have health problems? Their financial burden will be heavier.” I remark that will mean more will need to be pumped in terms of administrative resources. “It will but I think if the result is that we can get fairer, better applications of our resources which are finite, I think it’s well worth the effort.” REGAINING THE PUBLIC’S TRUST I ask him what he’s been doing since 2011 to regain the public’s trust. “A lot more effort has gone into revamping our feedback mechanism. Every single one of the MPs must know the ground well enough so that we don’t only end up knowing around elections that there’s unhappiness about this policy or that policy.” Most notably, he makes an effort to recruit and hear from grassroots leaders of diverse backgrounds who are willing to give MPs an honest picture of ground sentiment. I ask him if he thinks the PAP has successfully regained the public’s trust. “I wouldn’t judge it based on the 2015 results alone but just going by what I see on the ground, I think people appreciate that the Government spends time addressing the unhappiness, whether it is in terms of social transfers or immigration policies. I think that has made a difference over the years.” He admits the transport system has been “a constant bane”. “But with time, it’ll be sorted out. As with all functioning and mature democracies, the trust level ebbs and flows on different issues. But I think the overall trust in the Government has remained healthy. It’s a gut feel I have while internalising everything that I see, everything that I hear, talking to people within or outside of my constituency.” He concedes that on specific issues “more could be done” in terms of communication. “CareShield Life for example is meant as a good policy but people are asking if we’re making money out of it. The Government could afford to explain why we’re doing it and to allay such concerns. We’ll see all that come to light when we debate the issue in Parliament but I do think more could be done to bring home the key messages in a way that the average Singaporean can better appreciate.” THE OPPOSITION As we move on to talking about his assessment of the opposition Workers’ Party’s performance in Parliament, he becomes momentarily circumspect. “If you have constructive debates with opposition MPs who are well-meaning, well-intentioned, I think that would make for a better Singapore and that makes for refinements in our policies. So I welcome that. I think good quality opposition with constructive debates in Parliament can only be good for us.” When asked to be specific, he says he feels the Workers' Party has not been quite as constructive as he would like. “Once we get into a situation where the opposition only takes potshots at policies without being constructive and offering something back in return, then I think if the ministers and the front benchers have to spend their time defending their positions without getting something positive in return, I’m not sure that’s constructive.” But just because the opposition doesn’t offer up suggestions while criticising policy, should their criticisms be dismissed? “Ideally, if I tell you something is wrong about what you are saying, I must be able to tell you not just what’s wrong but what I can change about it. I think that makes for a good democracy. But their criticism should not be dismissed. But also, I think after a while when you repeatedly get the same arguments in very broad terms, it’s not constructive.” He cites the last Budget debate as an example. “The Government said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) needs to be raised. It gives indication that it won’t happen in this decade, but soon. The opposition then votes against the Budget on that basis. I listened to their speeches. I didn't discern any other major objections.  \"So on the basis that GST is going to be raised in the future, they voted against the Budget. I felt that was not constructive. If they felt that there was something wrong with it, why it should not be raised, they should have made the point.” I remark that many members of the public who expressed themselves online seemed to think the opposition had adequately explained their objection to the GST hike. Among the citizenry, many raised the same questions the opposition had about the GST issue. “But look at the information. Look at what Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has been saying about the Budget. Look at what had been said even prior to that. Make an assessment as to where we are, looking at healthcare costs, looking at the population profile, looking at demographics.” He admits however that when it comes to such issues, the Government could afford to improve its communication to the public.  “In the years leading up to this year’s Budget, I think you’ll see that the information is out there - what the expenditure needs to be focused on, what is the state of the reserves. But I also agree that there’s always room for improvement in the way we transmit the information to the ground, the way the Government communicates. I think constant engagement with the public will only improve that.” Recently, Mr Tong was also part of the the Select Committee set up to look into combating the problem of deliberate online falsehoods. During the hearings to consider oral evidence presented by experts, industry stakeholders and members of the public, the committee drew public criticism from some quarters for its harsh questioning of certain individuals such as academic PJ Thum, who gave oral evidence. “I wouldn’t agree with the broad generalisation that those who disagree with the Government were treated poorer than others. PJ had a certain view that ultimately meant that the Government was the primary purveyors of false information and obviously if you make that kind of submission, it has to be challenged.  \"The amount of time it took is not necessarily a representation of what you might term as prejudicially treating someone who’s not in favour of the Government’s views but really just the amount of time needed to go through the material and to understand the material that he was relying on.” As for the issue of deliberate online falsehoods in general, he feels there needs to be a balance in how they are dealt with. “I think we don’t want to use a sledgehammer to deal with something that is not significant. But at the same time, we also don’t want to be toothless because fake news, by definition, moves very quickly. We want to make sure that we are able to deal with that kind of situation but at the same time, not stifle free speech. There’s a lot of room for debate on what can be done but there must be something in place to deal with it.\" MAKING THE TRANSITION As he is about to assume the role of Senior Minister of State for Law and Health, we discuss what he feels are issues that need to be looked into in each sphere. “In law, I think making access to justice, lowering the threshold is key. For the man in the street, sometimes the costs become prohibitive. The process becomes prohibitive. Getting probate done when a family member passes on is also not straightforward. I think those kinds of refinements can still be done.” When it comes to healthcare, he is concerned about caregivers. “We need to look at what more we can do for caregivers of people who are not well. You can’t rely on the primary care in the hospitals all the time. Many of those who are not well, can be treated or looked after at home but they may not have the same level of support, both infrastructurally and financially. We have to try and find a way to level that playing field.” However, healthcare costs in general are still a concern too. “Costs are not coming down. I think if you look around the world, Singaporeans demand the best healthcare options and I think rightly so and we have to deliver that. The tradeoff for giving first-rate healthcare support and options to Singaporeans must be also that Singaporeans must be responsible for their own health. \"You see how now some countries have sugar taxes. So you actually do try to find a way to control lifestyle because I think people realise that with social spending and the social costs of looking after people and healthcare, there must be a sense of responsibility.\" As we end our conversation, he admits that embarking on this new phase of his career is “disarming”. “Policy-making and being in the public sector is new to me, so it’s really moving from an environment that is known and comfortable to one that is not. I’d like to say that in my legal career, I had nurtured a good team that I’m very comfortable with, very strong lawyers.  \"One of my regrets would be not being able to see some of them through their development, but I think that’s how it is. I feel that at my age, it’s a good time for a new challenge and I’m happy to be asked to play a part in this.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/edwin-tong-senior-minister-of-state-city-harvest-on-the-record-10483428"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 11:18PM", "tags": [], "author": "Olivia Siong", "title": "Tianjin Party Secretary hails success of eco-city in meeting with DPM Teo", "content": " TIANJIN: The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City is a prime example of green development, said Tianjin Party Secretary Li Hongzhong on Saturday (Jun 30) as he met visiting Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.  This year marks the 10th anniversary of Tianjin Eco-City - the second joint project between Singapore and China.  And as Chinese authorities try to integrate the neighbouring Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei economies to ease congestion and pollution in the capital, Mr Li said that lessons learnt from the Tianjin Eco-City project would be a great help. “This year marks the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening up to the outside world,” Mr Li added. “For the past four decades, China has also benefited a lot from learning from the successful experience of Singapore.” In his opening remarks, Mr Li noted that the Tianjin Eco-City project site used to be barren land, but the place now enjoys a good reputation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region for its liveable environment.  The eco-friendly industries and green businesses are also important yardsticks, which set the example for China’s future growth and sustainable development.  “We have made great achievements and (Tianjin Eco-City) is now a successful example of a green development,” said Mr Li.  “For the past 10 years, this project has been progressing smoothly and we all know that houses there are sold very well and at a relatively high price.\" He added there is great impetus to speed up the development of the eco-city and this would provide opportunities for companies and businessmen who come to the area.  Mr Teo, who is on a nine-day visit to China, met Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng on Friday, with both men reaffirming the \"longstanding, strong and substantive relations\" between the two countries.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tianjin-party-secretary-hails-success-of-eco-city-in-meeting-10487016"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["SAF", "defence"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "SAF acquires new fighting machines to do more with less, will reveal replacement for F-16 fighter jets soon", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is overhauling its arsenal, adding new warplanes, submarines and warships as it gears up for a future with fewer soldiers. High on the agenda is the replacement for the ageing F-16 fighter jets, with Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen saying on Friday (Jun 29) that a decision will be made in the coming months. “F-16s would face obsolescence beyond 2030,” Dr Ng said of the 30-year-old jets. “To plan for a replacement is not as if you are going to buy a new car, you actually need a lead time of eight to 10 years.” For the past few years, speculation has swirled around potential replacements, with Lockheed Martin’s fifth-generation F-35 fighter emerging as top contender. As early as 2013, Dr Ng had told Parliament that the F-35 was one option. But Singapore has consistently maintained that it would not be rushed into a decision. “You need to know first of all what platform, what your needs are, how you are going to maintain. You also need to know how you are going to train your pilots, where you are going to train pilots, especially on such a small island,” Dr Ng said. “We thought long and hard about it, taken our time to choose a replacement, and we would be making a definitive decision likely in the next few months.” However, Dr Ng would not be drawn into details, saying only that the new jet should be cost-effective, easy to maintain and capable of working with other platforms across the SAF. “In the market you can only choose what is out there,” he added. “When air forces are choosing replacements, the usual suspects come up: Whether it’s the (European) Typhoons, F-35s, (Russian) Sukhois or Chinese-made stealth fighters.” In addition to the fighter jets, Dr Ng announced various hardware replacements across the services, as the SAF prepares for a one-third manpower reduction by 2030. “For the SAF to be able to protect another generation, you have to do more with less,” he said, calling the manpower challenges a “significant disruptor”. AIR FORCE The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will replace its heavy and medium lift helicopters with similar models that can carry more, fly farther and require less manpower. Starting 2020, the Chinook and Super Puma helicopters will be replaced by the CH-47F heavy lift and H225M medium lift helicopters, respectively. The RSAF has also started replacing its KC-135R tanker aircraft with the A330 multi-role tanker transport, which carries 20 per cent more refuelling capacity. “It’s a petrol kiosk in the sky,” Dr Ng said of the plane, which will make its first public appearance at the RSAF50 parade on Sep 1. On the ground, the RSAF has begun switching out its I-HAWK surface-to-air missile system with the ASTER-30, which has both anti-aircraft and anti-missile capabilities. (The I-HAWK could only deal with aircraft.) The ASTER-30 also has a longer range of up to 70km. “The fact that you have bigger planes, planes with longer endurance and ground defence systems with longer range also means that when you exercise, you actually need a bigger training area,” Dr Ng said. “That’s not possible for Singapore.” To that end, Dr Ng revealed that the RSAF will launch next month a new facility to experiment, test, validate and operationalise new warfare concepts in a single set-up. The Air Warfare Centre will allow the RSAF to do all these “without the physical need for that space”, Dr Ng said. “That is a more important addition.” ARMY Moving on to the Army, Dr Ng said the proportion of manoeuvre units operating on track and on wheels will double by 2030. “The next-generation Army would be faster, heavier, more deadly,” he added. The next-gen armoured fighting vehicle, to replace the ageing M113 vehicles starting next year, will certainly be deadlier. It requires 20 per cent less manpower and can fire on the move. “I think this would be the centrepiece of the next-generation Army,” Dr Ng said. The next-gen Howitzer 155mm gun, to replace the current FH-2000 variant beyond 2020, will also cut manpower requirements by a third. The gun is fully automated, mounted on a vehicle and has a higher rate of fire. “Shoot and scoot, so you don’t face counter battery fire,” Dr Ng mused. And then comes the soldiers themselves. While Dr Ng said he was not quite ready to announce how a next-gen infantry battalion would be like, he offered a description that would not look out of place in a science-fiction movie. Beyond 2020, troops will fight in tandem with robots, using weaponised unmanned ground vehicles and palm-sized unmanned aerial vehicles that detect threats, clear rooms and follow like slaves. “You can give voice activations: Move right, move left, tell me my danger; being able to communicate and see what other soldiers see,” Dr Ng said. “I think this is the next germination of the SAF. I don’t want to spell out programmes that are too experimental, but I would tell you that they are going on.” NAVY At sea, the SAF is ringing the changes too. From 2021, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) will get four German-made Type 218SG submarines to replace its Archer-class and Challenger-class submarines, which have been in operation for two decades. It is the first time the RSN is acquiring new-build submarines, which means they would not have entered the water prior to launch. “Our new submarines would represent a quantum jump in subsurface capabilities,” Dr Ng said, pointing out that they have an increased endurance of 50 per cent. Besides that, the submarines come with improved capabilities like modern combat systems and air independent propulsion systems. They can also carry a wider range of mission-specific equipment. In addition to crew training in Germany, the RSN will develop a submarine trainer suite to train and qualify submariners in realistic and simulated operations at sea. Beyond 2030, the RSN is also replacing its Victory-class missile corvettes and Endurance-class tank landing ships with multi-role combat vessels and joint multi mission ships, respectively. The multi-role combat vessel will act as a mothership for smaller, unmanned ships that can be equipped with weapons or modular payloads for different missions. “You can send out unmanned slaves on air, on surface or even sub-surface, to deal with mines for instance,” Dr Ng said. “It’s not a theoretical concept. We tested various modules.” The joint multi mission ship will be even bigger than the current Landing Ship Tank, which is already the RSN’s largest ship. It also has two times more lift capacity and better command platform capabilities. In addition, the joint multi mission ship will allow the RSN to conduct more types of operations, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts and counter-piracy operations. PLANNING, SPENDING AND MAKING FRIENDS Before deciding on these purchases, Dr Ng reiterated that the SAF had considered whether they would contribute to a leaner fighting force post-2030. “Because we are able to plan long term, we start with the planning perimeter that you have to either maintain the same capability or do more but with less,” he said. As for the costs, Dr Ng said even with these new acquisitions, defence spending will be kept steady for the next decade, in line with the budget assessment he made earlier this year. “If we have to provide security coverage – as we did for the Trump-Kim meeting – every week, all bets are off,” he joked. And Dr Ng was asked if these new platforms would require the SAF to look for more overseas training opportunities given the constraints of space in Singapore. “We have good friends who allow us to train in their countries,” Dr Ng said, pointing out that the expansion of training areas in Queensland, Australia, where Singapore troops frequently train in a space at least four times the size of Singapore, is “progressing well”. Even then, Dr Ng added that Singapore is always on the lookout for more partnerships and training opportunities. “We are very thankful because we keep receiving offers. That spells a lot for the friendships we cultivated.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saf-f16-fighter-jet-replacement-new-fighting-machines-10485834"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["defence", "technology"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "No more ‘rush to wait, wait to rush’: NSman app, smart SAF camps to improve efficiency", "content": " SINGAPORE: Tired of turning up for in-camp training (ICT) without knowing what’s in store and then waiting for hours to get your bed sheet from the store? The Army is trying to change that by using technology to improve experience and productivity, as Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen called for a future Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) that suits Singapore’s next generation of soldiers – digital natives who welcome innovation. “Because the SAF was made mainly for NSmen (operationally-ready national servicemen), you got to get their buy-in,” he said in an interview on Friday (Jun 29) ahead of SAF Day on Jul 1. “We can’t operate systems which are 2G and expect 3G or 4G soldiers to use that.” One innovation is a smart ICT app that allows Army NSmen to check packing lists and training programmes six months before reporting to camp, as well as complete surveys and send messages to each other. The app will be rolled out from 2019. “What used to be a task that is performed on pen and paper is now digital and allows the NSman to be mobile,” said Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Lennon Tan, head general staff HQ Signals and Command Systems. “Our NSmen find that the app has greatly shortened some of the time that is needed to perform the administrative task. So, they now can pay more focus to what matters most, and that is the training.\" For NSmen who need to defer their ICT due to external commitments, checking the training programme well in advance allows them to plan appointments around the schedule, or take a day off rather than defer the whole week. Previously, NSmen could only check the programme on the day they report for ICT, which can typically last for up to two weeks. “Without the app, we had to physically turn to the programme and take time off during non-critical training elements,” said Captain (CPT) (NS) Neo Say Wei, 43, who has served 17 years of ICTs. During ICT, NSmen can use the app to complete their post ICT-survey on the go, as opposed to gathering in big groups and completing hard copy questionnaires in the past. “In the past, results were compiled only a few days after ICT,” LTC Tan said. “Now, the commanding officer can get it in near real time, and immediately note some of the key issues the NSmen faced during their ICT and address them in a timelier fashion, which is important for strengthening engagement.” BENEFITS FOR COMMANDERS The benefits extend to ICT commanders, who are also NSmen. They are given extra access rights to edit the training schedule on the go, when previously they had to meet with ICT trainers before making the changes. When the app was trialed during CPT (NS) Neo’s ICT in June, he observed on one occasion that his troops, who were returning from a field exercise, would not make it in time for the next training session. So CPT (NS) Neo, who is also head of operations and training at the 779th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment, decided to make adjustments. While still out in the field, he called the trainers and referred them to the app to consult on the changes. Once agreed, he used the app to update the schedule, and the change was reflected almost immediately. CPT (NS) Neo then sent a one-line WhatsApp group message asking fellow commanders to check the updated schedule on the app. Previously, the message had to explain the exact change, and as a result was long and clunky. “In the past, you’d get lost in the whole translation of messages because every day there’s a lot of updates going on in WhatsApp,” he added. “If you didn’t scroll up, you’d miss it.” CPT (NS) Neo said the quick and seamless change allowed soldiers coming back from the field to ease into a less strenuous session, giving them more time to rest. “Whenever we receive the training schedule, we can pre-empt where it always spills over and we can adjust,” he said. “So, that basically eliminates (the times) in the past where you have rush to wait, wait to rush.” Besides updating training schedules, commanders can indicate on the app whether their men have reported to camp, and mark absentees together with the reason and duration. This was done on paper, previously. The information is also updated in near real time, allowing higher commanders to account for manpower across various sub-units using a single interface. “This is a big improvement to the efficiency of how we compile the daily parade state,” LTC Tan said. POSITIVE RESPONSE This improved efficiency seems to be the consensus on the ground, with LTC Tan saying he received “very encouraging” feedback from three NS units, comprising more than 1,000 soldiers, that tried the app during their ICTs. The first trial took place in January. LTC Tan said the app will be rolled out “progressively across the Army starting from 2019”, adding that there are plans to include the Navy and Air Force as well. But he declined to offer a timeline as it depended on when ICTs take place and the number of units coming on board. “There are certain infrastructural enhancements that we need to build in place. That is more on the back end,” he added. NSmen will eventually log into the app using their SingPass, LTC Tan said, as he allayed concerns about the app’s security. “First of all, there is no sensitive information to be put on the app,” he said. “Data is stored on internal server, not on the Internet. Within internal servers, we have adequate security measures to protect the data.” Most of its features are text-based and not heavy on graphics, LTC Tan said, so the app will not take up a big chunk of anyone’s data plan. As for NSmen without smartphones, LTC Tan said commanders and buddies can still update them through traditional means like text messages. When asked about sensitive areas where smartphones are prohibited, LTC Tan stressed that the app is designed to support, not replace, traditional command processes. “Whatever training they are going through, the commanders must update the soldiers on what’s happening,” he added. SMART CAMP Another app that will make things more efficient is the camp companion app, which gives access to camp, unit and training information on the go. These include alerts, unit routine orders, training programmes and medical status. The app will also come with a digital identification feature that allows servicemen to indent meals, reserve camp facilities and report incidents. The camp companion is just one of several initiatives that make up a smart camp concept. These initiatives, which cover cookhouses, stores and armskotes, will be trialled at selected camps from the end of this year. At smart cookhouses, servicemen can indicate their meal preference via the camp companion, while weekend duty personnel can pick up their food from automated dispensers. Smart stores and armskotes will reduce manpower requirements. At self-service stores, servicemen can draw and return equipment at their convenience, while tracking technology keeps tabs on controlled equipment like weapons. “I should be able to know who returned arms or whether the arms are clean or not by electronic means,” Dr Ng said, highlighting other examples like facial recognition technology that screens people for malicious intent as they walk through a camp. Dr Ng said the possibilities are endless. “The idea is that you really can cut down a lot of daily rituals and waiting time if you use smart technology,\" he added. “We are currently working on it, and the next-generation SAF must keep pace with the expectations of the next generation of Singaporeans.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/rush-to-wait-nsman-app-smart-saf-camps-improve-efficiency-10485926"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["security", "Middle Rocks", "Pedra Branca", "Ng Eng Hen"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Singapore open to increasing security cooperation with Malaysia around Middle Rocks, Pedra Branca: Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore is ready to strengthen security cooperation with Malaysia near Middle Rocks and Pedra Branca, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said, adding that this would reduce resources needed to secure crucial shipping lanes in the area. Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu had proposed in an interview on Thursday that the two countries improve security in those waters, which serve as an entry point to the busy Singapore Strait that links major economies in the Middle East and East Asia. “I completely support what he says,” Dr Ng told reporters on Friday (Jun 29) ahead of SAF Day. “It makes no sense to deploy more resources around Pedra Branca or Middle Rocks if we can decide on a common plan.” Currently both countries, together with Indonesia and Thailand, conduct joint patrols along the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. Member navies meet regularly to review and improve coordination, and exchange intelligence on suspicious incidents. “It would reduce our requirements there, and we can come to an understanding, as we do for search-and rescue missions,” Dr Ng said without elaborating further, as he praised his counterpart’s “enlightened perspective”. As such, Dr Ng said he would explore the option at upcoming bilateral or multilateral meetings. “As (our) closest neighbours, certainly collaboration is a way, and we would look for more opportunities to do things together.” The minister’s comments come as relations between Singapore and Malaysia are in the spotlight. On Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called the price of water being sold to Singapore “ridiculous”, as he vowed to renegotiate the decades-old water agreement. “I would approach the first few months of a Malaysian government with maturity, respect and understanding,” Dr Ng said. “Mature to know that with a new boss and new government, they will do it differently. And not to jump up and down when styles and priorities change.” To that end, Dr Ng said Singapore need not “respond to every articulation”, adding that Malaysia could be dealing with an “internal audience”.  “You live in an HDB flat, a new neighbour comes in, you can hear through the walls what he says to his family, don’t keep knocking at your neighbour’s door to give inputs,” Dr Ng said. “Sometimes, it’s for his family, not yours.” Nevertheless, Dr Ng said the two countries should have mutual respect for agreements and international law. “If you talk about water, yes, there are water agreements,” he added. “If you talk about Middle Rocks, whatever they want to do if it complies with international law, you should respect they have the right to.” In 2008, the International Court of Justice awarded Middle Rocks to Malaysia but ruled that nearby Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore. Malaysia filed a challenge to the ruling last year, but dropped it shortly after the Malaysian government took office. Despite the challenges, Dr Ng said it is important that the countries work together. “If we can help, we will, but if it’s out of mutual respect and mutual benefit, we are both sovereign nations with our own needs,” he said. On a lighter note, Dr Ng said relations between Malaysians and Singaporeans are “still very good”. “There will never be a situation where fewer go to Malaysia and vice versa because the food is too good on both sides for instance, and we need places to relax,” he added. “We are neighbours for life. Just take it within our stride.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cooperate-security-malaysia-pedra-branca-middle-rocks-10485766"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["Trump-Kim summit", "defence"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Short of real war, Trump-Kim summit was a test that proved SAF’s capabilities: Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: The recent Trump-Kim summit was a real test that validated Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) capabilities, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said, as he praised the military for passing with flying colours. “Short of a real war or terror attack, this is a real threat that the SAF can respond to,” Dr Ng told reporters on Friday (Jun 29) ahead of SAF Day. “I guess in exam terms, this is the prelim test which I think we scored an ‘A’.” About 2,000 personnel and a wide array of assets, including fighter jets, surface-to-air missiles and a landing ship tank, were deployed for the Jun 12 summit. Dr Ng said the mission was clear: Provide “absolute security” for the two high-profile leaders. “Pictures showed manicured gardens but around them there was a hive of activity,” he added. “There was no margin for error, the consequences are unthinkable.” With only two weeks to prepare, the SAF spared no detail. Even before US President Donald Trump landed at Paya Lebar on Jun 10, it deployed hundreds of soldiers around the air base, ensuring no-one could target Air Force One. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s arrival before him was no different. And throughout the summit period, security operations continued.  In the air, fighter jets carrying live missiles – rare for local operations – were scrambled. At sea, security teams checking for malicious intent boarded every ship passing through the Singapore Strait. On land, special forces took up discreet positions on Sentosa. Sentosa’s proximity to busy shipping links proved challenging, Dr Ng said, as vessels passing by its exposed shorefront could make a sudden turn and break land in a matter of minutes. Singapore also coordinated maritime security with Indonesia, which only last year jailed militants who planned to fire a rocket at Marina Bay from nearby Batam. The ever-present terrorist threat in the region meant intelligence agencies were on high alert, Dr Ng said, as they screened chatter to sniff out potential plots. “You’re publicising to the world where you’re going to be and what time,” he added. “The situation lends itself to mischief makers who want to draw world attention.” While Dr Ng said there eventually was no direct proof of malicious intent, it did not mean there was no danger. “Let me just say that sophisticated networks or terror elements can hide threats quite well,” he said. “We had to deal with scenarios like 9/11 where some determined terrorist cell would want to attack by air, or munitions from offshore islands south of Sentosa.” The SAF only stood down after Mr Trump left Singapore on the evening of Jun 12. It was a \"sigh of relief\", then mission accomplished. “It was a very clear sign that the SAF means business,” Dr Ng said, calling it a strong show of deterrence. “It’s a reassurance that all these years of stable investments into defence, building up unit by unit, tells us that when the test comes we can perform.” In addition, Dr Ng said it was a \"measure of strength\" that authorities managed to keep Singapore running throughout the summit. \"The more you secure your systems, and yes there were inconveniences, but by no means that Singapore has to shut down airports or highways for the whole duration of the summit,\" he added. \"All that we have invested, these are our payoffs, that we can function even if there is no margin for error.\" But the minister was not entirely pleased with the performance. “I will give it an ‘A’ grade, not ‘A+’, because we identified some gaps which we are closing,” he said. “Sometimes an even greater success is learning gaps in your system, and that’s very valuable. “Obviously, I’m not going to share with you because I’m going to plug those gaps.” Nevertheless, Dr Ng said SAF’s showing was a “very strong confidence booster”. “Singaporeans can take heart that when we need to defend Singapore, the SAF can do it.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/trump-kim-summit-test-proved-saf-capabilities-10485780"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 04:34PM", "tags": ["environment", "nature", "Singapore Botanic Gardens", "NParks"], "author": "Tan Si Hui", "title": "Singapore's first ethnobotany garden opens at Botanic Gardens", "content": " SINGAPORE: There's a new attraction at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, with the opening of Singapore's first ethnobotany garden on Saturday (Jun 30). Ethnobotany is the study of the relationship between plants and people.  The new garden, featuring about 300 plant species, showcases how early settlers and the indigenous people of Southeast Asia made use of plants in their culture and daily life. The garden includes a new Centre for Ethnobotany, housing an exhibition of more than 100 artefacts. Located within the Bukit Timah Core of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the new garden was built in an area historically known as the \"Economic Garden\". In the late 19th century, the area was used for experimental crops after the British recognised Singapore’s potential to trade plant commodities. Foreign crops such as coffee, sugarcane and cacao were brought into the gardens for testing and trialling in the local climate, before being distributed to the local population. FOUR THEMES: LIVING, SYMBOLISM, MEDICINAL AND CRAFT The Ethnobotany Garden features plants that are native to Southeast Asia used in four areas - for living, symbolism, medicinal and craft purposes. It is the largest such collection in the region. In the craft zone, visitors can see how plants have been used for creative and artistic expression by indigenous tribes in the region. Fibres of plants in this zone are used as building materials for housing structures and weaving baskets. Plants used in everyday life are showcased in the living zone, including those such as the Ipoh Tree and sweet potatoes. Constructing the garden took one-and-a-half years to complete, according to Director (Development) of the Singapore Botanic Gardens Ng Yuin-Mae. “In today’s context, when we walk into a forest, we see the plants and trees, but we don’t have any relationship with them,\" said Ms Ng. \"A hundred or more years ago when people walked into a forest, it’s like a supermarket, they get their everyday needs inside the forest.\" “That’s something we want to bring back - the knowledge, educational and practical value of plants.” CENTRE FOR ETHNOBOTANY At the Centre for Ethnobotany, three themes are in focus: How plants have economic significance, how plant materials have been used and the preservation of plants and indigenous knowledge. In collaboration with Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment, the centre will also manage a research programme for ethnobotany. The opening of the Ethnobotany Garden is in conjunction with the annual Singapore Botanic Gardens Heritage Festival. Activities and programmes will be spread across the gardens and run from Jun 30 to Jul 8, 2018.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-first-ethnobotany-garden-opens-at-botanic-gardens-10485816"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 02:23PM", "tags": ["Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic"], "author": "Cheryl Goh", "title": "Redeveloped Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic officially reopens with new wheelchair tilter", "content": " SINGAPORE: The redeveloped Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic officially reopened on Saturday (Jun 30), with bigger floor space, special features and a new model of care to better serve residents, especially the elderly. It is the first polyclinic in Singapore with a “wheelchair tilter” for dental patients, so that wheelchair users do not need to transfer to a dental chair to receive treatment. “It mimics a dental chair and it allows wheelchair users to lie down or recline fully,” said Dr Kenneth Low, who is the Director of Dental Services, National Healthcare Group Polyclinic. “It prevents injuries to the patient in the transfers and also protects the dentists from any injuries that may occur during the delivery of these treatments.” The dental room will also be equipped with X-ray facilities so that patients can undergo tooth X-rays in the same treatment area. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is also Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC, took a tour of the polyclinic’s new facilities on Saturday. The 8,752 sq m building along Ang Mo Kio Central 2 boasts features which are friendly to the elderly and those with limited mobility. These include more spacious passage ways, wider consultation rooms and more lifts to accommodate wheelchair users. For seniors, there are handrails, non-slip flooring and distinct colour aides to help them move about independently.   TEAM-BASED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS The polyclinic also offers physiotherapy and podiatry services for patients with musculoskeletal and foot conditions under one roof – something it could not do at its old site (at Block 723 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8) due to space constraints. Another first: The polyclinic houses a senior care centre within its premises. Frail patients may be referred to the St Luke’s ElderCare centre for day care, rehabilitation or home care services if needed. The new Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic is also built and designed to accommodate what it calls a new “relationship-focused” and team-based model of care for patients with chronic conditions. Such patients will be assigned to what is called “teamlets” in the medical profession – comprising two to three family physicians, a nurse and a care coordinator – who will see them at every visit. “We have specifically designed the rooms such that the two doctors are sitting adjacent to the care manager (nurse) and care coordinator,” said Head of Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic, Dr Christopher Chong. “So even in a six-floor building, we want patients to know that every time they come, they’ll be seen in the same care area, by the same team members.” The polyclinic currently has six such teamlets looking after about 30,000 patients with chronic conditions.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/redeveloped-ang-mo-kio-polyclinic-officially-reopens-with-new-10485748"}, {"datetime": "30 Jun 2018 11:21AM", "tags": ["Loansharks", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Police arrest 16-year-old girl for loanshark harassment", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 16-year-old girl has been arrested for her suspected involvement in loansharking activities, police said on Saturday (Jun 30).

I must say I did not think that oBike’s end would come so swiftly, otherwise I would have withdrawn my deposit with the firm in time. So, what does the oBike closure in Singapore mean? 1. BUSINESSES MUST CHART A PATH TO PROFITABILITY The first lesson here is that any business must have a sustainable business model.  Lately, there have been a number of money-losing ideas that have been jazzed up under the buzzwords of “sharing economy” and “new business models”. Sceptics of these companies are branded as people who do not understand new technologies and are on the backfoot to embracing the future. Not wanting to miss out on potential wins, venture capitalists have been seemingly over-eager in funding many business ideas that do not have sustainable business plans past five years. But, with or without easy money from VCs, aspiring entrepreneurs would do well to chart out a path to profitability. To me, it was not clear that oBike had done this — to work out how and when it would become profitable. In times of euphoria, poorly conceived ideas may get funded and survive for some time, but they will meet their fate sooner or later. It is in the interests of entrepreneurial companies to think deeply about the “when” and “how” of profitability. 2. REALLY KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS - HAVING THEIR DATA DOESN’T MEAN YOU HAVE INSIGHTS The second lesson is the ability to really know who your customers are and what they want. There is certainly value in collecting data about customer behavioural vis-à-vis purchasing patterns, as what Amazon does. However, to extract real insights that translates into actual value for the business in the form of greater revenue from general purpose data such as bike-riding patterns is challenging. Unlike Amazon’s data about customer purchases or browsing patterns, the collected data – information about renting a bike at point A (say, near my home) and returning it at point B (say, near a hawker centre or a supermarket) –  has a very weak connection to customer purchases, or even intentions that could have helped oBike gain more additional revenue. Even if some value can be extracted out of this information, it is likely to be minuscule and hardly sufficient to justify a business pricing below costs in its core operations (bike rental, in this case). 3. BE AWARE OF ERRANT CUSTOMERS A third lesson from this story, and an important one that young entrepreneurs may be missing out on, is about customer behaviour and its implications. Some percentage of customers are likely to be errant - as in if they are not given incentives (either positive or negative) to use or park bikes appropriately, they will be abusive to the equipment. The loss ratio because of these types of customers may be magnified by vandalism — a bike parked in a remote location is far more likely to be vandalised than a bike parked in a busy place like an MRT station. The costs of collecting bikes parked all over the place will also go up, and some are bound to be missed because of obscure locations. Thus there is an additive effect that needs to be accounted for, such as parking, vandalism and costs of collection, which can lead to an unexpectedly large negative impact on a business model. Any new business model needs to factor in these kinds of additive effects. 4. INCLUDE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE BEFORE ENTERING A MARKET  The fourth lesson is the need to build capabilities within the start-up to mitigate regulatory changes in different countries they operate in. The oBike management seems to suggest that the Singapore Government’s new regulations are too onerous. While the regulations are indeed stringent and impose a number of costs in the form of new requirements as well as potential fines, oBike should have seen it coming. While the Singapore Government might want to encourage the usage of bikes because bike-riding is environmentally friendly and also eases pressure on public transport, encouraging bike usage cannot come at the expense of Singapore’s image of a clean and organised city, which has been cultivated over several decades. Bikes parked at various places, some vandalised with parts missing, were an eyesore in an otherwise clean landscape. Even in other countries, bikes strewn around have invited regulations. 5. BUSINESS FOUNDERS SHOULD GET BASICS RIGHT And the final lesson is that founders and owners should get their basics right with their companies. Disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and analytics may have opened up new avenues for earning revenues and profits, but it is unlikely that the old rule for business success of charging prices that will cover your costs will change. A price war for the sake of capturing market share might bleed you dry. Any new company in the bike-sharing space or otherwise will do well to remember that.

It is said that social workers play an important role in this process. However, tackling poverty requires that we go further than that. As a social worker, I lead a team of 20 who work with around 350 families at any one time. The low-income families we work with face many difficult choices. LIVING WITH SOMEONE YOU DON’T KNOW Some time ago, a young colleague came into my office one morning. He wanted to discuss the situation of Mr Tan*, a man in his sixties who was going to be evicted from his current place of stay. He was unable to get along with his sister, who co-owns the flat with her husband. Mr Tan had strained relationships with his other siblings and no means of income. He was eligible for HDB public rental housing. But as he could not list a family member as co-occupier, he had to find another single person to be co-tenant in a one-room flat under the Joint Singles Scheme. HDB provided a list of names. However Mr Tan declined and so was referred to our team to discuss other options. When my colleague asked what advice he should give Mr Tan, he said this:  You know, I wouldn’t want to live with someone I don’t know either. We would normally persuade clients like Mr Tan* to accept rental housing. We will also refer them to employment agencies such as the Employment and Employability Institute (known as e2i) for career guidance and job-matching.  In the interim, they will apply for short-term financial from the Social Service Office (SSO). They do not qualify for long-term assistance as they are able-bodied.  The social worker will also coach them to use the financial aid wisely: Cut down on cigarettes, prepare meals at home more often instead of eating out, walk instead of taking a bus or a taxi. The financial aid will stretch further that way. SOCIAL PARTICIPATION In another case, we are working with Madam Rani*, a single mother. Her youngest child, aged 6, has special needs and requires full-time care.  Her older children who are still in school, aged 15 to 18, recently found regular weekend jobs to provide for their own out-of-school expenses. They work so the additional income can allow them to participate in activities with their friends and afford the things their friends have. All these because these friendships are very important to them. But when her children’s earnings were discovered during an income assessment, she was accused of misreporting her family income and her assistance was reduced.  When we heard, we advised Madam Rani’s children to contribute towards their family’s expenses, knowing this would be at the expense of those social opportunities which mean so much to them. The problem is, social participation is not considered a basic need and its value is invisible to the accounting of financial assistance. WHEN SALARIES RISE In a third case, Mr Ali* finds himself in a dilemma. He had done well at work and was offered a promotion. Should he accept the promotion, his salary would increase by approximately S$80. However, the salary increase means that the rental for his HDB flat may be raised under the rules of the public rental scheme. He is unsure if the raise in rental will be greater than his salary increase. This causes much anxiety in Mr Ali. When we heard that Mr Ali was planning to turn down his promotion, the social worker stepped in and persuaded him to change his mind. The social worker suggested that paying higher rent is fair since he is earning more. The subsidies are, after all, taxpayers’ money. LISTENING TO CLIENTS In my 15 years of work with low-income families, having worked with hundreds of cases each year, I wish these three were isolated examples but they are not. Their struggles with poverty, with the formal systems are common. The fact that it is so widespread should raise discomfort in all of us, whether we are social service practitioners or not. Giving clients practical advice is part of social work practice. But it is incomplete. It also comes at a cost. Mr Tan’s homelessness would be resolved when he conforms to the expectations of the Joint Single Rental Scheme. However, housing is not just about shelter and physical safety. It is also about privacy and a sense of security. It is a place where we feel most at ease and we rest from the day. For many of us, it is a place for leisure and social participation, for pursuing our interests and spending time with friends and family. All of these are important. A public rental flat provides a basic standard of physical shelter. But living with a stranger in 30 sq m of space without partitions – about one third the size of a typical four-room flat – offers little privacy, security, or opportunities for meaningful social interactions and emotional connections. When we listen to Mr Tan’s concerns, we begin to understand that conforming to what is available in order to meet immediate physical needs may require him to trade off long-term social and emotional needs. When Madam Rani’s children cut back on social activities, the sort of activities they see their peers get involved in, it is not only frustrating for the children. It also limits their access to the social experiences and relationships that are important at their age. It affects their chances and ability to fit into their peer groups. While Mr Ali’s colleagues celebrate when they are promoted, he may have to decide between a raise and keeping rent affordable. We can only appreciate the dilemmas and struggles of the poor when we lean in to understand. Their experiences help us to reflect critically on our policies, identify gaps, and propose changes.  In the long run, this can help policies to be fairer and take into account social and emotional needs. LISTENING TO SOCIETY Recent commentaries have highlighted the importance of setting minimum standards of living so that people’s needs can be better met. Such standards go beyond food, shelter, and clothing. We must also take into account things like access to the internet, socialising and recreation, which allow people to participate in society. Minimum standards are produced by inviting views from members of the public and different segments of society. These participants come together in focus groups to discuss and decide on what constitutes a basic living standard. READ: Inequality has a geographical dimension in Singapore, a commentary.  READ: Direct housing interventions needed to tackle inequality, a commentary. The outcome is based on consensus, rather than the opinions of helping professionals or policymakers. These standards are about listening to what society thinks about the things required for individuals to reach their full potential. In the United Kingdom, this process also provides a reference for policymaking. We can learn from this example. Such intentional engagement of the public not only provides an opportunity for robust discussion about basic needs, it also encourages civic participation and fosters trust. LISTEN, UNDERSTAND, CO-CREATE It is important to give practical advice to low-income families, and help them to understand the motivations and rationale behind the policies.  Beyond this, we need to listen to their experiences, try to understand the effects of policies, and deliberate as a society about the minimum standards of living that we find acceptable.  It is not a binary process, where we pitch what policymakers and professionals think versus what society desires. It takes all parties to listen in, understand and co-create solutions to tackle poverty. This will be a difficult process, but is one we must not shy away from. *The names used in this commentary are pseudonyms.

Ms Lau, 32, did not hesitate at all when she saw an online appeal for a liver donor for six-month-old Jayden Chong. All she thought of was saving him if she could. But there was a part of her that was guilty - was she being a selfish mother by not putting her son first? None of what she felt then though compares to the overwhelming happiness she feels now, knowing it was her liver that saved Jayden, who was critically ill with acute liver failure. Speaking to Channel NewsAsia at her home in Tampines, she related what she had told her friends just before the operation.  “I don’t know what made me do this, but when I saw this innocent baby facing death, I knew I had to do something,” said Ms Lau. Ms Lau, who requested to be identified only by her surname, had lost her mother to liver cancer when she was just 10 years old and knew fully the agony of watching a loved one waste away. Her family had waited and hoped for a liver donor, but it did not materialise, and her mother died after a one-and-a-half year battle. \"I remember asking my family members every day whether there was a donor,\" said Ms Lau, the youngest of four children. “It was a very painful process to see an energetic person deteriorating slowly into someone who can't even recognise you,” she recalled. Ms Lau had also experienced the loss of a child and could not bear for another mother to go through the same pain.   Four years ago, she suffered a stillbirth when she was six months pregnant. “To be honest, at this point, I am not afraid of death anymore, and if I could save this baby, I would have lived my life without regrets,” the IT market manager told her friends in a text message before she went for the operation to donate her liver to Jayden. ONLINE PLEA FOR HELP Ms Lau’s journey to becoming a liver donor began with an online plea for help put up by Jayden’s mother, Ms Kelly Law, on Jun 14. Jayden, a healthy six-month baby, and his family were visiting relatives in Malaysia on Jun 7 when they realised that his skin and the white of his eyes had a yellow tinge to them. A week later, Jayden’s parents were told that their baby would need a liver transplant to survive. Ms Law and her husband were found to be unsuitable matches. “My whole world collapsed,” Ms Law said in her online plea for help on Facebook. The night after Jayden’s mother made the post, Ms Lau came across it. She decided to contact Ms Law and by the next morning was having a battery of tests done at the National University Hospital (NUH) to determine if she was a suitable donor. Ms Lau knew that she was healthy enough: she ate well, exercised and did not drink. “If it was fated to be me, I didn’t want to hold back,\" Ms Lau said. The next day, on Sunday morning, Ms Lau received a call informing her that she was a suitable donor.  Her first reaction was to text her friends to say that she had struck the lottery, because “what are the chances?”, she said. BECOMING A “SUPERHERO” At the hospital, she was evaluated by an ethics committee, who made sure her reasons for wanting to donate were valid, among other checks. The risks of being a liver donor was also conveyed to her. Even after being told that she would also lose her gall bladder and that death was one of the possible complications from being a living donor, Ms Lau pressed on with her decision. She was also told to prepare for the possibility that Jayden could still die even after the transplant. A seven-and-a-half-hour operation was carried out at 7am on Tuesday, Jun 19.  Cheered on by the success of the operation, Ms Lau took a selfie and sent it to her loved ones. She was discharged from hospital after five days - the same person, save for a 15-cm scar, and a new nickname of “superhero”.  The liver has the ability to regenerate, but without a gall bladder, Ms Lau will have to be careful about the amount of fat in the food she consumes for the rest of her life.  “MUMMY HASN’T CARRIED OR HUGGED YOU IN A LONG TIME” Jayden spent eight days in the intensive care unit (ICU) following the surgery and was transferred to a general ward on Jun 27. When Channel NewsAsia visited him at the hospital, Jayden was sound asleep with his right arm curled snugly around a small bolster. “Previously, he couldn’t even bring his hand up when doctors inserted a plastic tube into it,” his mother, Ms Law said. Her voice quivered and her eyes teared up as she recalled how sick he had been, saying that he “barely cried or made any sound” when the doctors at NUH drew his blood for tests. “They said he did not have the strength to cry or react like babies do, and that was not a good sign. I felt my heart sink,” she said in Mandarin. “Thankfully, now when we show him his toys, he reaches out his hands. He’s getting better, day by day.” The reason for Jayden’s sudden life-threatening condition remains an unknown. To stay close to their son, Ms Law and her husband have been staying at the Ronald McDonald Family Room in NUH for the past two weeks. The haunting prospect of losing her youngest child has been a “nightmare” for the 37-year-old, who also has another five-year-old daughter. “I’ve cried too many times,” she said. “My husband has been putting up a strong front in front of me, but one of the social workers told me that he cried during his session with them.” The young mother said she is grateful for the “hundreds of calls and messages” that she has received since making the appeal on social media, and is particularly thankful to Ms Lau, a “cheerful” and “selfless” woman, for doing “an act that is unimaginable for someone not related by blood”. “When I visited her the day after the operation, all I wanted was to give her a big hug but I didn’t because I was worried it might hurt her,” said Ms Law. “I told her that I don’t know how to thank her enough for this. She replied that this is the work of fate and we don’t have to dwell on it. All she wanted was for Jayden to grow up healthily and be a filial son. “I said that Jayden will have to be filial to her too because she is the one who gave him a second chance at life.” For now, Jayden will remain warded for at least one more month. His parents will be encouraging their “brave little warrior” along. “I’ve been telling him that he needs to keep recovering because his sister misses him and that mummy hasn’t carried or hugged him in a long time” said Ms Law, pausing to dry her eyes.  “I really want to hug you. You must get well soon.” Also eager for Ms Lau to have a quick and smooth recovery, she has engaged a confinement nanny to cook nutritious food for her son’s saviour. SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE Ms Lau, on her end, is recuperating at home. She said that she is grateful for the support given to her by her family and husband of eight years. The company she works for also had no qualms allowing her to take five weeks off to rest at home.  While most of her friends were 100 per cent behind her decision to donate her liver to a complete stranger, Ms Lau said that one friend had voiced his concerns. “Why donate to someone unrelated? What if someone you know needs it?” he asked. Ms Lau’s response? “And what if they don’t?” Ms Lau intends to keep in touch with Jayden, and has visited him and his mother a few times since the transplant. With all that has happened in the last two weeks, Ms Lau is still in a daze about doing something so “crazy”.  “Thinking back, I don’t know why I did it. I surprised even myself,” she said.  But she recommends it.  “Anyone can do it. It’s just whether they are willing to give it a shot. We don’t only have to help people who are related to us.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/stranger-donated-liver-to-6-month-old-baby-10479596"}, {"datetime": "29 Jun 2018 10:57PM", "tags": ["education", "university"], "author": "Deborah Wong", "title": "Singapore universities should look beyond international rankings: Panel", "content": " SINGAPORE: An international panel of academic experts and industry leaders has recommended that Singapore should develop a holistic evaluation framework for its universities instead of being fixated on international rankings. The three-day International Academic Advisory Panel (IAAP), which started on Wednesday (Jun 27), was themed The Role of Universities in Defining Singapore’s Future. The panel, which convenes once every two to three years, was formed by the Education Ministry to advise the Government on ways to develop the university landscape. Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, who attended the discussions, shared with the media on Friday that a new assessment model was needed, considering the differentiated university landscape in Singapore. \"At the minimum, it has to reflect our three major emphases. One, the value of education; two, how we are doing in terms of lifelong learning; and three, research, and not just research in terms of publications and patents but how it translates into impact - whether it's in improving lives or creating jobs. \"I think we need a much more holistic view of a very complex function that universities are now performing,\" he said. Professor Stephen Toope, Vice-Chancellor at Cambridge University who was invited as a panellist, also pointed out that it is inaccurate to judge all universities by the same yardstick. “Different universities have different roles. Rankings tend to pull everyone back towards a mean, and make it seem as though there is one model of university that's right. And I think that's a fundamental misconception,” he said. LIFELONG LEARNING AND IMPACTFUL RESEARCH During the discussions, panellists affirmed that university education has to become more experiential to help students develop the soft skills needed to adapt to rapid changes. While they commended Singapore for leading the charge in lifelong learning, they pointed out that more support is needed as adult learners have different interests and needs as compared to younger students. They also underlined the importance of impactful research in providing an additional platform for industries and universities to collaborate. Mr Ong noted that this collaboration was a key component in getting students ready for the workforce. CHANGING UNIVERSITY ADMISSION PROCESSES Singapore Management University Provost, Professor Lily Kong, who attended the discussions, suggested that university admission processes in Singapore could also be reviewed to ensure a diversity of educational pathways. This can be in the form of aptitude tests. “In one of our schools, we will have a group conversation. We pose a challenge or questions and we see how they think on their feet. We're not looking for right answers, but we are looking at how they think and process their thoughts,” she said. The panel said that all these measures should steer students towards thriving in a diversified education landscape, but employers should also do their part by looking beyond academic qualifications and recognising achievements outside the classroom.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-universities-should-look-beyond-international-rankings-10484568"}, {"datetime": "29 Jun 2018 10:38PM", "tags": ["ICA", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "ICA foils two attempts to bring in kratom at Woodlands Checkpoint", "content": " SINGAPORE: It might be passed off as a herbal drink, but kratom is prohibited in Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in a Facebook post on Friday (Jun 29).

Meanwhile, Singapore’s Shubigi Rao and Thailand’s Thasnai Sethaseree received the Jurors’ Choice Awards, while the People’s Choice Award went to Indonesia’s Gede Mahendra Yasa. The results were announced tonight (Jun 29) at a ceremony graced by Minister of Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu at the National Museum of Singapore (NMS). Given out every three years, the awards were launched in 2008 by the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) and the Asia Pacific Breweries Foundation, and is considered one of the most prestigious contemporary art prizes in the Asia Pacific region. For this edition, it has also extended towards Central Asia. This year’s winners were chosen from a pool of 15 finalist artworks, all of which will be on view at NMS until Sep 2. Nguyen’s grand prize-winning work is titled Tropical Siesta. It comprises two videos and six oil paintings that portrayed an imaginary community, based on 17th-century observations by a French missionary. SAM senior curator and jury member Joyce Toh described the winning artist’s work as “quiet and deeply poetic”.  She added that \"the film pulls the viewer into its enigmatic world – a world governed entirely by children. Even as it explores a number of complex issues in Vietnamese history, the work feels fresh and very much alive\". “My artwork, Tropical Siesta, is a video installation that explores hidden histories of Vietnam imaginatively through the lens of children. The artwork is not just about historical events, but also how an artist feels and sees a particular narrative, and develops it into the language of painting and video,” said Nguyen. She added: “Winning the Grand Prize is extremely significant to me. Singapore is a place that has helped me develop and mature as an artist, as I spent a year studying here, and also completed an artist residency.\" For their Jurors’ Choice Awards, Rao presented Pulp: A Short Biography Of The Banished Book. Vol I: Written In The Margins (2014–2016), a mixed-media installation that touches on the history of the destruction of books and libraries. Sethaseree, meanwhile, had created Untitled (Hua Lamphong), a huge collage on canvas featuring Thai Buddhist monks’ robes. Said Rao: “Winning one of the Jurors’ Choice Awards is truly a validation of my work. I am originally from India and I’ve been living in Singapore for 18 years now – so this work was born out of this cross-national identity, and grapples with what it means to have culture, what it means to lose it, and ultimately what gets retained as cultural capital.” The People’s Choice Awardee Gede received the highest number of on-site votes at the exhibition for his Paradise Lost #1, a dense and richly detailed painting depicting everyday Indonesian life and history.  The Balinese artist, however, was unable to personally receive his award, after the island's airport was closed earlier today due to the volcanic eruption. The grand prize winner will receive a cash award of S$60,000, while the two Jurors’ Choice Awardees will receive S$15,000 each. The People’s Choice Award comes with S$10,000.

And for the most part, the Moments of Life (Families) app - one of five Smart Nation strategic national projects - has delivered on these promises. The pilot app - designed for families expecting a child to those with children aged up to six - was released on both iOS and Android app stores on Friday (Jun 29) for the public, but a group of 70 families had an early peek at what the app had to offer. Mdm Nur Sooleezaa Saadon, mother of two children aged four and two, shared with Channel NewsAsia in an interview ahead of the app’s launch that she found it “very useful”. “As a working mum with two toddlers, the ability to register for and track the medical appointments of my children saves me time,” she said. Another app, HealthHub, jointly developed by the Health Ministry and Health Promotion Board (HPB), offers these services too, but Mdm Sooleezaa shared that while it was easy to use for her first child, kinks started to appear for her second. She shared that she had to manually add her second child to the HealthHub app, but repeated failure to do so due to technical issues meant she gave up using it. With the MOL (Families) app, children’s information is automatically retrieved as these are in parents’ SingPass accounts. Another welcomed feature was the ability to search for childcare centres around her neighbourhood, particularly the “traffic light” icons used to indicate whether the centre was full or not, Mdm Sooleezaa said. “This was helpful in managing expectations, as I could decide whether to wait or to find alternatives, and not wait in vain for the centre to reply,” she explained. The 27-year-old was first approached to give feedback at the early developmental stage of the app last September, before returning in February this year to undergo an eye tracker exercise for the app developers to see how people are interacting with the software. MORE EFFICIENT USE OF TIME Another parent who got the chance to try the app was Ms Charlene Tan, who just delivered her second child a week ago. “Making (the process of registering my child’s birth) into an app allows us to register at our own free time,” Ms Tan told Channel NewsAsia in an interview on Friday. She added: “Registering at the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) or the hospital requires us to go in person during the opening hours and the wait can be pretty long. “The new dad and mum would be doing all these administrative matters instead of spending time bonding with the baby and resting at home.” There is a designated counter at ICA for parents who register and set up an appointment via the app to collect the birth certificate. The self-employed mother of two did point out that the app could do with more features, including the ability to apply for a passport for the child at the same time. “Since we’re already going down to ICA, we might as well do it all at the same time,” Ms Tan explained. It would have come in handy for her first child, Aven, as they had applied for his passport and birth certificate at the same time, she revealed. Other features on her wishlist include incorporating some of the features on other apps, like PSI reading on the myENV app by National Environment Agency and extending the loan time for books from the National Library Board. USER-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT Such feedback from users like Mdm Sooleezaa and Ms Tan was the foundation of how the MOL (Families) app was created. Over a period of 12 months, a series of engagement sessions were carried out to get citizens' inputs and find out their needs and difficulties when parenting young children, according to a fact sheet by the Public Service Division (PSD). “This citizen-centric engagement informed the design of a user interface and inclusion of features that are relevant to families with young children,” it added. With the eye tracker exercise, the 15-strong development team from Government Technology Agency (GovTech) had the opportunity to refine what they had in its early prototype to the version that was launched today, said Mr Lim Eyung, deputy director of Government Digital Services at GovTech. He told Channel NewsAsia that one example is during the birth registration process. In the earlier version, one field to fill was the child’s race and the option to list two races if both parents are from different races.

For harassing her and for criminal intimidation, the sales executive was sentenced to nine months in jail on Friday (Jun 29). Neither the accused nor his victim can be named due to a court order. The court heard that the man entered into a relationship with the woman, a 30-year-old with two children aged 10 and 11, at the beginning of last year. He was angry she broke up with him and “wanted to threaten her to stop going out with other men”, according to court documents. When they got to know each other, his girlfriend was in the process of moving out of her parents’ home with her children. The man helped her with the move. After the relationship ended, he repeatedly called and messaged her, insulted her on Facebook and was seen loitering around her old home.  MORE THAN TEN DAYS OF HARASSMENT AND THREATS Three days after the woman made a police report, the man went to her new home while she was overseas and stole items from the premises. While he was there, he sent her text messages of passcodes to the combination locks, which he had guessed. “He sent her these messages with the intention of making her feel threatened about him being able to access her house easily without her permission,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor Dora Tay. She made a second police report about the theft when she returned to Singapore. The same day, the man called his ex-girlfriend to tell her he had accessed her personal email, and that he had a video of them having sex. He threatened to post the video online if she went out with other men or did anything to displease him. While it was later found out that he had already deleted the video he had, he had retrieved past conversations, personal photographs, her children’s birth certificates and copies of her family's identity cards from her emails. She had previously given him the password for her email account. Knowing that he had such information made her believe he would post her photographs and sex video online.  Also the same day, the man posted on an online platform that his ex-girlfriend was available for sex, publishing her name and her mobile number. He sent screenshots of the post to her. The victim then made a third police report. THREATENED TO SET NEW HOME ON FIRE, TO KILL HER Still, he threatened to set her new home on fire by “leaking substances through the door gap” and told her he had posted compromising photos and videos of her online, but not on which websites. On May 4, he again posted her information online, this time on his Facebook page, saying people could reach her for free sex. He also threatened to kill her with a knife, saying “I can’t have, I make sure no one have”, District Judge Jasvender Kaur said on Friday.  He then posted a photograph showing her face on his Facebook page, saying that she liked to have multiple sexual partners.  He also posted the same messages on a website and a Facebook group. He replied to commenters, and encouraged them to contact her directly. The next day, he was called up by the police for investigations, but did not stop his activities. “As a result of the numerous online posts made by the accused, the victim received a lot of anonymous calls and phone messages, which made her feel very distressed and harassed,” the prosecution said. She also experienced emotional stress due to the continual fear that her ex-boyfriend will harm her and her family members. For criminal intimidation, he could have been jailed up to 10 years, fined, or both. For harassment, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$5,000 or both.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-gets-9-months-jail-after-threatening-to-kill-ex-girlfriend-10482982"}, {"datetime": "29 Jun 2018 12:46PM", "tags": ["Charities Act", "scam", "police", "crowdfunding"], "author": "", "title": "Woman behind 'milk blessing' group under probe, barred from fundraising ", "content": " SINGAPORE: A woman alleged to have cheated several people who raised money on crowdfunding platforms is being investigated by the police for possible criminal offences, and has been barred by the Commissioner of Charities (COC) from raising funds for charitable purposes.

Emeline Tang Wei Leng, 40, was employed by HSBC between 2004 and 2012, where she started as a relationship manager and rose through the ranks. In 2003, Tang had financial issues and found out that a distant relative of hers had come into some money after selling property. She devised a plan to cheat the 79-year-old. Tang told her relative that there was a promotional plan for fixed deposits with HSBC which offer a higher interest rate than other banks and said she could help open such an account for her. Tang knew that there was no such plan. Her relative, who was interested in the non-existent plan, agreed to open an account and was persuaded to issue a cash cheque instead of cheques payable to HSBC. The other four victims - three of them Tang's relatives aged 69, 79 and 45 - found out about the plan and gave money to Tang in order to open similar accounts. The last victim, 81, was a friend of two of the other victims. Between 2003 and 2015, whenever Tang ran into financial difficulties, she would ask the victims for money, purportedly to invest in other fixed deposit plans. She continued to deceive them into thinking she was still at HSBC even after she resigned in 2012. Initially, Tang deposited the funds from the victims into her HSBC account. However, she took to encashing the cheques and keeping the money at home in order not to arouse the bank's suspicions. She exchanged part of the money for gambling chips at Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa casinos, including S$600,000 worth of chips at the latter. The scam was exposed in January 2015 when some of the victims asked to withdraw funds from their fixed deposit plans. When Tang did not meet the victims, they asked HSBC about their \"investments\" and were told they did not have any with the bank. She faced 34 charges including cheating, forgery and dealing with the benefits of criminal behaviour. Another 223 related charges were taken into consideration. Deputy Public Prosecutor Haniza Abnass asked for a sentence of at least 10 years' jail, saying Tang had targeted vulnerable elderly victims who could no longer work to recoup the money, which was \"essentially their life savings\". She pointed at the planning and premeditation evident in the forged documents Tang prepared, including the use of the HSBC logo. She added that there was an abuse of trust as four of the victims were Tang's relatives - one was the aunt of Tang's husband, another was her sister-in-law and the other two distant relatives. Tang had returned about S$800,000 to the victims before investigations began, but the prosecutor urged the judge not to take this as a show of remorse as they were meant to be \"investment returns\" to perpetuate the scam. The defence asked for eight years' jail, saying that Tang was in an \"emotionally abusive\" relationship with her husband, who amassed gambling debts that she paid for, along with her father's medical fees. \"She is remorseful and has learnt her lesson,\" said the defence. \"She has lost her family and her husband.\" Tang and her husband divorced last year. District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim in her sentencing said Tang's victims \"have been so devastated that I don't see how they'll ever recover\".

In return, Johor is entitled to buy treated water of the same volume as up to 2 per cent of the water extracted by Singapore on any given day, or about 5mgd if Singapore draws its full entitlement of water from the Johore River. SUPPLYING ADDITIONAL POTABLE WATER TO JOHOR Singapore has on several occasions supplied additional potable water to Johor for various reasons, following requests for assistance from the Malaysian state's water regulatory body Badan Kawalselia Air Johor (BAKAJ). On Jul 17, 2016, national water agency PUB said it will supply an additional 6mgd of potable water a day for three days to Johor on an urgent request from BAKAJ. BAKAJ had said that it required the additional water to stabilise its own supply system in Johor Bahru after a temporary shutdown due to pollution in the Johore River. A month before that in June, PUB also agreed to supply an additional 6mgd of treated water a day for one month to Johor, in order to supplement its supply after dry weather severely affected water levels in Johor's Sungei Layang dam.

For years, dry spells in Johor and difference of opinions between Singapore and Malaysia, have raised periodic concerns about the nation’s water resources among people in Singapore. A handful also do not rule out the possibility of water rationing, even though the last time water rationing in the country was actually carried out was in the 1960s. In 1995, in an unusual campaign that lasted six days, an islandwide water rationing exercise was conducted involving 30,000 households. During this period, the water supply was interrupted for 14 hours on each day. The objective was to remind Singaporeans, especially youths, about the importance of water. How has the Singapore situation changed since then? GREATER DEMAND BUT INCREASED CAPACITY FOR WATER COLLECTION Since 1965 when Singapore became independent, the country has reinvented itself many times while amassing more water resources.  It has increased its size by about 25 per cent through land reclamation; but has developed 17 reservoirs from the three in 1965. The land area from which it is possible to collect water has increased to more than 67 per cent from 11 per cent. Singapore has become the leading country in producing reused water with NEWater covering up to 40 per cent of daily demand. Desalination produces up to 25 per cent of daily requirements. Singapore has also invested, and continues investing, in research and development, education and training when it comes to water. It also has one of the most efficient water utilities in the world - so much such that the Public Utilities Board (PUB) is better known as Singapore’s national water agency. On the demand side, water prices were adjusted in 2017 after 17 years to much public ruckus.  Yet, under the new pricing scheme effected in two phases over 2017 and 2018, potable water tariffs will increase by only S$0.04 per cubic metre compared to 2016's prices for consumption of 40 cubic metres or less of water each month and S$0.12 per cubic metre if consumption is more than 40 cubic metres, on top of increases to the water conservation tax.  Meanwhile, support for one- and two-room HDB flats in the form of vouchers has increased. With the objective to conserve and reduce water use, PUB has also developed efficiency measures for several sectors. Those of us living in Singapore have to give more credit to PUB for its performance for the last several decades, where it has made our lives more secure as we have access to clean water on a permanent basis. Sometimes the issue might ironically be one of too much water, where torrential rains have threatened to flood places in Singapore – including MRT tunnels –  but efforts to address flooding risks and enhance drainage infrastructure have been underway.   IMPORTANCE OF WATER CONSERVATION Even though there is no threat of water rationing as yet, it is essential for Singapore residents, businesses and industrial sectors to realise the importance of water conservation. There are imponderables such as climate change that are affecting the entire world. In Southeast Asia, the region has been hit by more frequent and intense floods in recent decades. In Singapore, more robust water sources that do not depend on the climate have been springing up. There are now five NEWater plants and three desalination plants, of which one was opened just this week. There is one more under construction and a final one at the planning stage. However, no system is perfect. What is the Achilles’ heel in the case of Singapore's water supply? Climate change? The water supply from Johor? Public inertia to water waste? It is all of the above. Between 2014 and 2015, water consumption in Singapore increased from 150 to 151 litres per person per day. One litre may not seem like much, but this translates into an additional 150 million litres of water consumed a month. If it still sounds insignificant, consider how much more electricity needed to treat and distribute water has been consumed. Energy to treat water varies from about 0.2 kWh per cubic metres for water from local catchments or Johor, to 1.0 kWh per cubic metres for NEWater, and 3.6 kWh per cubic metres for desalination. Saving water means saving energy as well. Thankfully water consumption in Singapore has since decreased to 148 litres per person each day in 2016 and 143 litres in 2017. While some have attributed the decrease in water consumption to the increase in water prices, does this mean that the price of water should increase every year, as it is the case with electricity, for people to be more conscious of its use? Surely, we can all modify habits without the need for a stick? Others have pointed to PUB’s development of a “smart shower programme” to study the effect of shower devices that tell people about how much water they have consumed and measure how much water is subsequently used.  But if we depend on a device to decide how much water to use, are we relegating our sense of responsibility to devices? READ: Beyond price hikes and conservation campaigns, saving water through smart showers. A commentary. As is the case every year, I have just been interviewed by students interested in water conservation and how to make this a sustainable practice among their families and youths their age. These intelligent, forward-looking students from Catholic Junior College and Raffles Institute had worked on initiatives that are not only commendable but should also be examined by authorities to see how they can be implemented and scaled up. More also can be done to understand at what point a young person, who is aware of the importance of water conservation and other similar ethical behaviours when it comes to the environment, forgets what they have internalise. It could pave the way for more inclusive, long-term educational programmes that ingrains an environmentally conscious attitude into the minds of our young. This way, waste of water and energy, food waste and littering could be a problem of the past. And Singapore’s water Achilles’ heel would be less vulnerable.

It is the year he turned 50, his son Adly Azizi reached 18, and together they ticked a major one off the bucket list by attending the football World Cup in Russia. “I’ve wanted to go to a World Cup since I saw the 1978 one on TV, held in Argentina and won by Argentina,” said Azamin, who has been a fan of La Albiceleste since. The financial planner and his son were buzzing after catching the first of three matches they’d bought tickets to - Iceland vs Croatia in Rostov-on-Don on Jun 26. “The fans were awesome,” said Azizi. “Everyone did the Viking clap, regardless of which team they supported.” A total of 3,241 match tickets have been allocated to Singaporeans. Also watching her first-ever World Cup in the flesh after “postponing for many years” was finance manager Zuraida, 55. The long-time Brazil fan was delighted to be in the stands with her husband as her team beat Costa Rica in Saint Petersburg. “I want to watch all the games but unfortunately due to work commitments, I can watch one only this time,” she said. “But I had a great time in St Petersburg - everyone is very helpful, their metro is very easy to follow and it’s been a wonderful experience.” Across the country and in the Black Sea city of Sochi, Elamaran Natarajan and his wife watched Portugal and Spain play out a thrilling 3-3 draw that left fans of both teams chanting Cristiano Ronaldo’s name at the end. “The good experience is definitely the coming together of fans of all over the world,” said Elamaran, who was also in Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. “We took pictures and conversed with people from France, Russia, Peru, Mexico, Brazil, Portugal. “They all had a unique take on football and it was just an electrifying and amazing atmosphere.” Seasoned World Cup spectator Vishaal Bhardwaj, 40, also had kind words for Russia’s organisation of the quadrennial football spectacle. Having attended the last three events dating back to 2006, he said it would be hard to match expectations with the exuberant party that was Brazil in 2014.  “But Russia is doing as well as Germany in 2006,” offered Vishaal, who was in Moscow to catch the Germany-Mexico match with a group of 11, including family and friends.  “So many locals have stopped us to ask if we need help,” he said, echoing Zuraida’s point. “The trains and their stations are art pieces unto themselves. The cleanliness even reminds me of Singapore.” Vishaal added it was surreal to be in Russia having fun with his parents Pushpinder Mohan, 66 and Nelam Lata, 63. “My only gripe is the lack of accessibility for older folks,” he said, pointing to Russia’s preference for staircases over elevators both around town and at the stadiums. Elamaran also said that, to a certain extent, the language barrier made public transport in Sochi difficult. “There were volunteers to help fans but not enough signage and not many people are able to help us because most don’t speak English,” he commented. Nonetheless all agreed that the experience of being at “The Greatest Show on Earth” was priceless overall. “Between my son’s studies and my work, I’m just glad to find bonding time,” said Azamin. “Otherwise we’d just be playing FIFA at home!”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/singaporeans-russia-world-cup-football-10480268"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 10:59PM", "tags": ["Singapore", "China", "economy"], "author": "Olivia Siong", "title": "Singapore, China can break new ground through Belt and Road: DPM Teo", "content": " BEIJING: Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has said that Singapore and China can break new ground through cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative.  He was speaking in an interview with the Chinese Xinhua News Agency ahead of a nine-day visit to China which begins on Thursday (Jun 28). “Singapore and China have enjoyed a strong friendship for more than 40 years, through mutually beneficial cooperation,” said Mr Teo.  He also noted that the relationship has progressed, reflecting new needs and opportunities as both countries developed.  “On this firm foundation, I believe we can break new ground through cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative and take our relations to greater heights,” he added. SINGAPORE’S ROLE IN THE BELT AND ROAD China's ambitious Belt and Road project seeks to revive the ancient Silk Road - by building infrastructure like roads, railways and ports in more than 60 countries to promote trade.  Mr Teo, however, was asked about criticism that the programme is causing countries along the route to incur debt burdens.  “I see the Belt and Road Initiative as a constructive initiative to strengthen trade and investment ties, and enhance integration and interdependence,” said Mr Teo. “This was why Singapore was an early supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative.” Mr Teo added that as an infrastructure development and financing centre, the city-state can play a role in project financing and structuring.  It can also provide supporting professional and dispute resolution services.  Mr Teo pointed out that Singapore is one of the top three offshore Renminbi centres globally and can promote financial connectivity, through its support of China’s RMB internationalisation efforts.  The Republic has accounted for about 85 per cent of total inbound investment to China from Belt and Road countries, and about a quarter of China’s outbound investments to these countries.  A STRONG SIGNAL ON COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE Mr Teo was also asked about the progress of negotiations on the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA).  Six rounds of negotiations have taken place so far with the latest in April.  “With trade protectionist sentiments on the rise, both countries understand the importance of sending a strong signal of our joint commitment towards free trade by concluding a forward-looking, substantive and comprehensive upgrade of the CSFTA before the end of this year,” stressed Mr Teo.  He added it is for the same reason that Singapore hopes the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) can be concluded soon.  The trade pact involves the 10 ASEAN member states and their six other partners – China, Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand.  This comes amid a backdrop of escalating trade tensions between China and the United States, which also withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact last year.  “The upgraded CSFTA, together with the RCEP, will send a positive signal to the world on our joint commitment to free trade and an open, rules-based, multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organisation,” said Mr Teo.  MEETING NEW LEADERS, CATCHING UP WITH OLD FRIENDS Mr Teo was last in China in February 2017 and he said his visit this time will be an opportunity to meet newly appointed Chinese leaders and “catch up with old friends”. In particular, Mr Teo said he is looking forward to meeting Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng, who is taking over as the co-chair of the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) – the highest level forum between Singapore and China.  He succeeds former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, who retired after the 19th Party Congress in October last year.  Mr Teo, who is the other co-chair of the forum, said he will be discussing the agenda of the JCBC with Mr Han.  “Both sides are laying the groundwork for a substantive meeting at our upcoming 14th JCBC in Singapore later this year,” he said. Noting that bilateral cooperation with China has been making good progress, particularly in the last year, Mr Teo said Singapore looks forward to welcoming Chinese Premier Li Keqiang for his first official bilateral visit in November.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-china-belt-and-road-initiative-dpm-teo-chee-hean-10481102"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 10:01PM", "tags": ["Financial Times", "Mike Pompeo", "law", "government", "Donald Trump", "government & politics"], "author": "", "title": "US Secretary of State Pompeo to visit North Korea next week: Report", "content": " WASHINGTON: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to travel to North Korea next week to discuss the country's denuclearization plans, the Financial Times reported on Thursday (Jun 28), citing four people familiar with his plans.

Professor Hugh Durrant-Whyte, chief scientific adviser with the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, said today’s developments in AI are automating processes in jobs like accountancy and law. These are things that tertiary institutions are currently teaching graduates, who might be the most affected by the emergence of the technology, he added. He was speaking during a plenary session at the inaugural Singapore Defence Technology Summit on Thursday (Jun 28). “We are not losing jobs (to AI), but the job market is being polarised,” said Prof Durrant-Whyte. The jobs that are being created are at the “bottom end”, such as the delivery of food or cleaning services - tasks and skills that are actually quite difficult to automate, he explained.  AI FREES PEOPLE UP FOR INTERESTING JOBS: SENSETIME FOUNDER Another panellist, SenseTime founder Tang Xiao’ou, had a different take on the situation.  SenseTime is a Chinese AI unicorn that in April raised US$600 million in funds from investors like Alibaba Group and Singapore state fund Temasek, and touts itself as the world’s most valuable company focused on computer vision and deep learning technologies. Prof Tang shared that the jobs AI may be used to replace them with are “not really interesting jobs”, like product labellers. “Farmers used to do everything manually, before machines came in and did those jobs. I don’t think these farmers are unhappy (about that),” he added. The freed-up worker who may, for example, be a former tennis expert will be able to then pursue a job like training his children to play the sport, he added. “There are jobs being created,” Prof Tang asserted. “(On our end,) we’re finding it difficult to hire software engineers.” To this, Prof Durrant-Whyte replied: “There are jobs being created but they aren’t (all for) software engineers.” For its part, Singapore launched its industry transformation map (ITM) for the professional services sector in January this year, during which it said thousands of jobs for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) are being created in new roles like cybersecurity consultants, data engineers and legal tech experts. At the heart of this roadmap are initiatives to drive innovation and equip the workforce with skills like data science and AI over the next five to 10 years, the Economic Development Board said then.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ai-development-targets-graduate-jobs-causes-polarisation-in-10479706"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 04:43PM", "tags": ["charity"], "author": "Cheryl Lin", "title": "About half of firms practise corporate giving; volunteering an area for improvement: NVPC", "content": " SINGAPORE: Samsui Supplies and Services (Samsui) churns out more than 1.5 million meals annually. However, these are not for the restaurant patrons of its parent company the Soup Restaurant Group, but for charities and nursing homes. As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility initiative, the food and beverage logistics company prepares the meals on top of its daily operations. This is a win-win situation, as the cost of doing charity work becomes incremental and staff do not have to go out of their way to help, said its director Mr Ang Kian Peng. According to the Corporate Giving Survey 2017 released on Thursday (Jun 28), about half (52 per cent) of the 707 firms surveyed engaged in corporate giving. Most of them (64 per cent), like Samsui, have integrated the giving process into their core operations. \"A lot of the businesses are thinking about: How do I align my business objectives with being relevant to the community, relevant to my stakeholders, relevant to my employees? That’s a key fact that we are happy about,\" said Ms Melissa Kwee, CEO of the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), which conducted the survey. However she added that companies could do more in terms of diversifying the ways in which they engage in corporate giving. The survey found that the most common way of corporate giving was through philanthropy (89 per cent), including things like cash donations, donation in kind and employee payroll deduction.  However, volunteering lagged far behind (39 per cent) - an area for improvement, according to Ms Kwee. “Beyond cash donations, there (are) a lot of different ways companies can give, and a lot of times we miss the obvious ways - the giving of skills, services or products that companies can provide to communities in need,\" she said. CORPORATE LEADERS PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE Meanwhile, the study also revealed that corporate leaders play an important role in driving a culture of giving. Companies with stronger C-suite involvement were shown to give more frequently, get more employee volunteers and pull together larger donation amounts. “We (the management team) are big on giving back. By giving in such a manner, we are able to encourage all our staff to give back. We’re building a platform for them,\" said Mr Ang. However, the study also found that 90 per cent of companies did not have employees hired specifically to handle corporate philanthropy. It said that a change in corporate culture and mindset was still needed to shift companies from being occasional givers to regular contributors. With the “encouraging” news that companies are ready to help, Ms Kwee said the next step was to better understand the needs of the community. “What are the challenges and how can you contribute meaningfully in a way that impacts the community? That next level is how we get people connected to the opportunities ... that exist out there.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/half-companies-corporate-giving-charity-volunteering-10479464"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 03:56PM", "tags": ["court", "crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Man who punched beautician over mole removal procedure jailed 6 months", "content": " SINGAPORE: A man who punched a beautician as his wound from a mole removal procedure was \"not healing well\" was sentenced to six months' jail on Thursday (Jun 28).

The Bandung-born singer-songwriter Sarasvati, an alumnus of the Nanyang Academy Of Fine Arts and former opera singer, has two albums under her belt as well as a couple of hit singles, with her YouTube videos garnering millions of views. Meanwhile, hip-hop artist Khalif won the Best Hip Hop award at the Anugerah Musik Indonesia last year. Homegrown singer Aisyah Aziz, meanwhile, established herself in the region with her debut single Mimpi, which won for Best Collaboration Song at Anugerah Planet Muzik in 2014. Fellow Singaporean, electronic musician Sokko, released her debut EP last year, with her single 600D catching fire on Spotify’s charts in Mexico, Latvia, Sweden and Singapore. Those keen for something more traditional can catch Cupu Manik Astagina: The Sacred Jewel Box, which combines wayang kulit, fusion gamelan music, modern dance, and animation to tell the story based on the Ramayana. Performers include the Angger Gamelan and Pemenang Dance Community from Indonesia, and Gamelan Asmaradana and Peneroka Daya Tari from Singapore. Aside from these performances, there will be an art and sound installation inside ACM – a work by husband-and-wife artist team Budi Agung Kuswara from Indonesia and Samantha Tio from Singapore. Their installation focuses on families living between both countries and was inspired by the folk tune Dayung Sampan.

Choy Peiyi, 35, was the director of Vanguard Project Management, a renovation and interior design firm.  Between November 2016 and March 2017, she doctored 23 invoices from various unwitting companies including Fish & Co Restaurants and Evershine Services, complete with ink stamps. She then submitted these fake invoices - supposedly for renovation works at the various companies - to two factoring agencies, Arc Trade Finance Fund and Capital Springboard, under a receivables purchase agreement. Factoring agencies buy \"receivables\" - in this case the fake invoices or debts - from a third-party company and disburse the amounts needed to repay the debts. The third-party company then repays the amounts with interest within six months. SHE USED FAKE INVOICES TO GET LARGE SUMS OF MONEY However, those debts did not exist. In order to get new sums of money to repay her old loans within six months, Choy perpetuated a pattern of creating fake invoices. Deceived into believing those invoices were real, Arc and Capital Springboard disbursed a total of about S$25 million to Choy over two years, incurring S$6.8 million in losses. Choy used about S$1.3 million to S$1.4 million to pay off her businesses' bad debts and for operating expenses. The ploy was discovered while Capital Springboard was assessing its accounts with Choy. Deputy Public Prosecutor Leong Weng Tat called for a jail sentence of 11 years to be imposed, saying that general deterrence was warranted and that the accused was \"clearly motivated by self-interest\". He noted that Choy spent the money on gambling at Marina Bay Sands, an overseas trip and buying a BMW, among other things. The defence, however, asked for not more than eight years, saying that Choy had repaid S$18.2 million of the S$25 million even before she was arrested. In response, the prosecutor said that this repayment was merely part of the business agreement.

GST on the imported services will take effect in two ways.  The first is a reverse charge mechanism for business-to-business imported services, where the local GST-registered business customer is required to account and pay GST to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) directly on the services it imports.  Most GST-registered businesses will not be affected, however, as they can claim full refund of the GST they incur on their purchases including imported services, MOF said in a news release on Thursday (Jun 28). The businesses that will be affected are primarily financial institutions and residential property developers, which do not get such full refunds, MOF added.  The second way the GST on imported services will be effected is through an overseas vendor registration (OVR) mode for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.  Under the OVR, overseas suppliers and electronic marketplace operators which make significant supplies of digital services to local consumers are required to register with IRAS. Once GST-registered, they will collect GST on their B2C supplies of digital services and pay it to IRAS.  ENHANCED POWERS FOR IRAS The proposed changes to the GST Act also includes giving IRAS officers enhanced powers to investigate tax crimes. If accepted, IRAS investigation officers will be able to perform forced entries, arrests without warrants, and body searches for certain serious tax crimes. \"Syndicates and recalcitrant taxpayers are becoming more active and are employing more sophisticated strategies for tax fraud,\" MOF said, adding that suspects have in the past refused to cooperate with IRAS' investigations, hand over potential evidence, and also destroyed evidence. \"Such acts of non-cooperation affect IRAS’ effectiveness in bringing the perpetrators to justice,\" MOF said. IRAS' powers will also be expanded to allow it to gather all information relevant to its investigations from any individual. It will also be allowed to share information with other law enforcement agencies to combat serious crimes that it assesses as critical for investigation or prosecution of serious crimes.  Custodial sentence will also be introduced for unauthorised collection of GST under the proposed changes, and alternative evidence besides invoices or receipts will be permitted to prove the crime.  Under the proposed changes, it will also be an offence for a GST-registered business - without reasonable excuse or through negligence - to collect more GST than allowed.  The amendments also extend customer accounting to transactions with the Government. This will help ease business compliance as GST-registered supplies will not need to differentiate their transactions with the Government and with GST-registered customers.  The last proposed change will also allow the disposal of documents or items seized during investigation if the owner of the seized items fails to collect the items upon the end of investigation.  The public can provide their feedback between Jun 28 and Jul 18.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/gst-act-amendments-public-feedback-imported-services-arrest-10478526"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 10:23AM", "tags": ["PUB", "water"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Singapore opens its third desalination plant in Tuas", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore on Thursday (Jun 28) opened its third desalination plant, boosting the country’s desalination capacity from 100 to 130 million gallons a day (mgd). The Tuas Desalination Plant, which can produce 30 million gallons of drinking water a day, will help to meet up to 30 per cent of Singapore’s current water demand. Spanning just 3.5ha - the size of three rugby fields - Tuas Desalination Plant is the country’s smallest plant to date.  Despite its size, the plant can produce the same amount of drinking water as SingSpring Desalination Plant, Singapore’s first such plant.  SingSpring occupies 6.3ha, nearly double the footprint of Tuas Desalination Plant. Both plants can produce up to 30mgd of drinking water, which is enough to supply to 200,000 households. The first to be owned and operated by PUB, the Tuas plant will also be used to test new energy-saving technologies. The plant is also the first in Singapore to adopt an advanced pre-treatment technology, which combines two existing filtration methods – dissolved air floatation and ultrafiltration.  This will help to reduce membrane fouling when treating seawater of varying water quality, as well as to prolong the lifespan of a membrane. To reduce the plant's carbon footprint, a 1.2MWp solar photovoltaic (PV) system will be installed on more than half of the plant’s roof surface by the end of the year. Covering more than 7,000 sq m, the solar PV system will be able to generate 1.4 million kWh of clean energy a year, which will be used to power the plant’s administrative building. With Singapore’s water demand projected to double from the current 430mgd by 2060, two more desalination plants are in the pipeline.  Slated to be completed in 2020, Marina East Desalination Plant and a fifth desalination plant at Jurong Island will bring the total daily water production in Singapore to 190mgd in two years’ time. INVESTMENTS IN WATER NETWORK \"HEAVY BUT NECESSARY\": MASAGOS Speaking at the opening of the plant, Minister for Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli pointed out the need for Singapore to continually expand and enhance its water supply network.  He cited examples of cities like Cape Town in South Africa and Sao Paulo in Brazil. In Sao Paulo, a severe drought had caused the stock level of its main reservoir fall below 4 per cent, and its 21 million inhabitants had at one point less than 20 days of water.  “We are laying more pipes to reach the population and industries in new growth nodes while maintaining and renewing existing water infrastructure,” said Mr Masagos.  He added that all these are “heavy, but necessary investments”, and take time. These investments must also be made ahead of time and demand, so Singaporeans will not face the same problems as Sao Paulo and Cape Town, the minister said.  “This is made possible by right-pricing water to reflect the long-run marginal cost of producing our next drop of water, which is likely to come from NEWater and desalinated water.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tuas-desalination-plant-water-singapore-pub-10477996"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 10:21AM", "tags": ["MediSave", "GST Vouchers"], "author": "", "title": "1.6 million Singaporeans to receive S$1 billion in GST Vouchers and MediSave top-ups", "content": " SINGAPORE: A total of 1.6 million Singaporeans will receive notifications by Jul 6 on their 2018 GST Voucher (GSTV) benefits and MediSave top-ups, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Thursday (Jun 28).

With that in mind, Mr Teo called for the international community to come up with codes of practice and norms for new technologies that about to be launched and do not yet have international standards.  He was speaking at the inaugural Singapore Defence Technology Summit here on Thursday (Jun 28). Illustrating the opportunities technology is bringing to the defence sector, the minister pointed to how commercial technologies and products like drones and robots are increasingly being adapted and used for defence and security applications like bomb disposal, reconnaissance and radiation detection. New sensing and data analysis tools are also enabling security agencies to seek out and detect potential threats before they develop into actual attacks, he added. “As unmanned and autonomous technologies mature, we can also expect more robots working together with us as a team,” Mr Teo said, citing the example of the Republic of Singapore Navy deploying unmanned surface vessels for protection missions in the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden. However, even as these new technologies become more widely deployed, new vulnerabilities are appearing, the minister said. Drones, for example, are becoming more affordable and capable. They are being used by criminals for smuggling and corporate espionage, while terrorists use them for surveillance and aerial delivery of improvised explosive devices. As devices become more connected, cities and businesses can become better managed. Yet, the same interconnectedness means vulnerabilities increase exponentially, Mr Teo said. “If we are concerned about air traffic control systems being hacked disrupting flights, what greater concerns and dangers there will be if UAVs and autonomous flying vehicles are added to the mix in the same airspace.\" The NotPetya cyberattack last year also demonstrated a new facet of unconventional warfare, he added.  The online attack crippled shipping giant Maersk’s IT systems and, given its ships dock somewhere in the world every 15 minutes with 10,000 to 20,000 containers, “there are significant knock-on effects on international supply chains across many industries”, Mr Teo said. Maersk had to rely on manual operations and use PSA's automated systems to help manage its vessels in the region and keep to their schedules as closely as possible, the minister said. With economies becoming more integrated and connected digitally, Mr Teo encouraged governments, companies and academia to form partnerships to better address issues that cut across sectors and national boundaries. “We look forward to working with our international partners to better understand how to deal with attacks not just on national systems, but global systems (like) the global financial system or cross-border trading or transport systems,” the minister said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/codes-of-practice-need-to-be-established-for-new-technologies-10477946"}, {"datetime": "28 Jun 2018 07:24AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Tea", "Nonya kueh", "National Day"], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "Inspired by Nyonya kueh, these tea flavours taste like kaya or gula melaka ", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: Want some nice cup of tea to go with your kueh?

There are other worries regarding upwards inflationary pressures on petrol prices harboured by car owners. A lesser known impact, however, is its effect on electricity tariffs, which is expected to increase in the third quarter of the year and should be announced before the end of June. READ: Behind SIA's relaunch of the longest commercial flight, a commentary.  OIL DRIVES THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY Much of Singapore’s energy needs are driven by oil imports. The consumption of petroleum products in both the industry and transport sector recorded a total of 9.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent, making up more than 63 per cent of total energy use in 2015, according to the 2017 Singapore Energy Statistics. Given oil’s role in driving Singapore’s economy, it is natural for businesses and consumers to fret when its prices exhibit unusual volatility or show signs of impending hikes in response to supply-demand dynamics, or other driving forces such as geopolitics and trade wars. While nowhere near those sky-high prices of more than US$100 a barrel from a few years ago, oil prices have surged recently to US$70 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil in May 2018 - the first time it has seen such levels in more than three years.  Coordinated supply cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and to a lesser extent, the US’s decision to impose sanctions on Iranian oil exports may have contributed to the rise. We can expect to see improvements in the immediate future given Russia and OPEC’s recent commitment to increase combined production of up to 1 million barrels a day. To what extent is this commitment sustainable remains to be seen given that only Saudi Arabia within the OPEC group and Russia have the technical capacity to increase production quickly while other OPEC members such as Venezuela and Iran are faced with political instabilities and export sanctions respectively. WHY YOUR BILLS MIGHT GO UP Some observers may question the correlation between oil prices and their own energy bills. A few questions are in order. First, why are oil prices still affecting electricity tariffs despite electricity mainly generated from natural gas in recent years? Second, will electricity tariffs continue to rise in tandem with oil prices? In Asia, purchased gas imports are typically pegged to oil price changes by pre-determined formulas due to the lack of an established pricing benchmark for gas trade. This nexus between oil and gas prices could weaken though, as more gas is being traded with greater flexibility in the future. As tariffs are set on a quarterly basis, they can only be adjusted based on historical oil prices, leading to a lag.  This adjustment makes sense if oil prices were averaged from a previous quarter, with the result then utilised to set electricity tariffs for the following quarter. Hence, in Singapore, changes in tariffs are often one quarter behind changes in oil prices. Based on this, electricity tariffs, adjusted in line with historical oil prices and factoring in the increase over the last quarter, could rise to beyond 23 cents per kWh for this upcoming quarter. What this means is households and businesses should prepare for yet another quarter of an increase in electricity tariffs - since oil prices already started to move up since mid-2017. Households already saw increases in electricity tariffs to 22.15 cents per kWh from April to June this year, from 21.56 per kWh in the first quarter of this year and 20.30 cents per kwh from October to December 2017. SUNNIER OUTLOOK FOR THE LONG TERM If Singapore households anticipate that electricity prices will continue to rise, then they should plan to conserve energy to save on their utility bills in the coming future. But this could be a hassle for some depending on lifestyles and preferences. Another option is for consumers to switch to an alternative electricity provider once the rest of Singapore opens to retail liberalisation in the second half of 2018. The very nature of retail competition will guarantee sizeable discounts off the current default Singapore Power (SP) bills. But it does not mean electricity prices will no longer be affected by oil prices, as alternative offers will have to reasonably reflect the cost of producing electricity from fossil fuels. For example, if households or businesses choose a discount-off pricing plan which offers a fixed discount off the regulated tariff set, prices will still move up and down over time, but remain at lower levels compared to SP tariffs. Other types of pricing plans including fixed price plans or peak or off peak price plans may be more suitable, depending on one’s consumption patterns.    READ: Assessing the benefits of an Open Electricity Market, a commentary. Those selecting hybrid plans with a percentage share of solar energy will enjoy smaller discounts off SP tariffs at present moment, as the cost of producing solar energy is still higher than the raw cost of generating electricity from fossil power plants.  However, this will change in the foreseeable future, with manufacturing costs of panels growing cheaper over time. Singapore households and businesses can expect further reductions in electricity costs as more solar power can be more reliably used to meet national demand, once large-scale energy storage systems can be fully harnessed to fill up electricity supply-demand shortfalls reliably. In short, electricity prices are currently still driven by oil price movements. Given that electricity retail liberalisation can potentially reduce electricity tariffs and at the same time offer cleaner sources of electricity for those more concerned about the environment, it is best for us consumers to seriously consider switching to alternative electricity providers to enhance our well-being.

As part of the launch, a small group of children joined the Olympic champion in the pool for a short training session. Lessons will begin on Jul 2 at the Tampines pool, and the school has already seen some advance sign-ups. “My own father almost drowned twice, so that’s why he put me in swim school,\" said Schooling. “Who would have thought that swimming would define who I am? Swim Schooling is all about empowering kids to be water-safe and to be confident in the water.” The school has plans to expand to a “few more venues” in Singapore and in the Southeast Asia region. Future courses will include teacher development training for swim coaches. However, the 22-year-old Schooling will not be teaching full-time at the school. Instead, he will be “running a couple of things” with his mother, May Schooling, who serves as one of the school’s directors. Said Schooling: “First and foremost, my priority is my training – getting ready for the Asian Games, or Tokyo 2020. I will be here as much as I can, see the kids and maybe get in the water with them.\" In the meantime, trained coaches employed by the school will conduct its courses.  The launch comes on the back of the Singapore National Swimming Championships that ended on Jun 23. Schooling bailed out of several events and only managed a bronze at the 100m freestyle finals. When asked about his performance, he said: \"Timing-wise it may not have looked that good, but my goals going into that meet (were) … dusting off the cobwebs, I haven't raced long course since Worlds last year.\" Taking the experience in his stride, Schooling said that he was on track for the upcoming 18th Asian Games in Indonesia this August.  \"I definitely (feel) more comfortable racing after this weekend. It's all about repetition right, you got to get as many reps as you can in, and so this weekend just got me to feel the pain, feel the racing pain, get back in the swing of things,\" he said. \"I am feeling very comfortable and very confident heading into the Asian Games.

Dr Ng, in his welcome speech at the inaugural Singapore Defence Technology Summit here, cited the example of the United States government’s ARPANET programme in 1969 as one that has made such a mark. The ARPANET was a network built to be resilient in the event of nuclear attacks, yet has evolved to become the Internet as we know it today, he said. He also pointed to the huge investments being made in technology, both by Government and the private sector. In fact, private sector funding in R&D hit a record high of US$702 billion last year, more than how much governments spent. In the US and Europe, the ratio of private to public sector investments in R&D is about 2:1, while the ratio in China is 3:1. In terms of geographical spread, Asian companies’ R&D spending has “more than quadrupled over the past decade”, while China now has the second-largest R&D spending in the world, the Defence Minister added. “The discovery and application of new technology are shifting to new epicentres from the US and Europe, to the Middle East and Asia,” Dr Ng noted. Singapore, too, has participated in the trend. He said that the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing are collaborating in digital technologies like 3D printing and data analytics. The Singapore Armed Forces is also deploying artificial intelligence in, for instance, its unmanned watch towers that monitor key installations like Jurong Island, he added. However, while these changes spell good news for the private sector, there are also risks and dilemmas to confront, the minister said. “How do we ensure that new technologies do not undermine our collective security?” Dr Ng said. He pointed to terrorists using encrypted messenger apps to orchestrate plots and data privacy violations by social media platforms as some of the challenges society has to deal with as a result. “These are tough questions and moral dilemmas to address, with often no easy or cost-free answers,” the minister said, adding that he hopes the summit will play a role in helping countries deal with the “many blessings and challenges” technological disruptions will bring in their wake.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/huge-investments-being-made-in-tech-but-security-remains-a-10476170"}, {"datetime": "27 Jun 2018 06:46PM", "tags": ["sailing", "Asian Games", "water sports"], "author": "Junn Loh", "title": "Singapore Sailing Federation unveils 15-member team for Asian Games", "content": " SINGAPORE: A team of 15 sailors are set to represent Singapore at the upcoming Asian Games in Indonesia, the Singapore Sailing Federation announced on Wednesday (Jun 27).  The federation has submitted its team list, which comprise a mix of new and experienced faces, to the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) for its approval.  They include duo Cheryl Teo and Elisa Yukie Yokoyama, who took home the gold in the women's 470 at last year’s SEA games.  The team hope to build on their success and are aiming for a podium finish. “I am feeling stronger and a lot more prepared than last year.

He was one of six people from an organised crime group charged in November last year under the law, which is targeted at crime syndicates. The court heard earlier that sometime in 2012, Or, who was then a newspaper vendor, was recruited by Lean Kay Chong, one of three leaders in the group.  Lean, whose case is pending, used to get his newspapers from Or outside Beauty World Centre. Lean told Or, who was earning S$50 a day, that he could earn extra income by working as an illegal gambling agent under him, collecting 4D and Toto bets. Or would need to source for his own punters. He would get a commission of 8 per cent of total bets collected, and an additional 5 per cent of the winning amount, if his punters struck the lottery. Or started work in January 2013 and, over time, had at least 20 regular punters placing illegal 4D and Toto bets with him. They would call or text him on his mobile phone to place their bets. Or would consolidate these bets and text Lean. Court documents showed that, up until his arrest in November 2016, Or earned up to S$62,000 in commission on the bets alone. On Wednesday, Or said in mitigation that he has to take care of his elderly father who suffers from heart problems. He also said that he suffers from the same health issue.  For his offences under the Organised Crime Act, he could have been fined up to S$100,000, jailed up to five years, or both.  Under the Remote Gambling Act and Common Gaming Houses Act, he could have been fined between S$20,000 and $200,000, jailed up to five years, or both.

Chia was the mastermind of a plan to abduct and assault Mr Chua more than a year after the affair had ended. Chia demonstrated \"a high degree of planning and premeditation\", he said.  While his accomplice, 36-year-old Indonesian national Febri Irwansyah Djatmiko, had inflicted the injuries on Mr Chua, Chia did not ask Febri to stop, the Chief Justice added.  Pointing to extensive fractures in Mr Chua’s skull, as well as blood stains found in the Choa Chu Kang car park and in the van where the attack happened, Chief Justice Menon also said that the attack was vicious and brutal. The prosecution said the sentence of life imprisonment was \"manifestly inadequate\" for what was \"a murder in cold blood where the professed intention from the outset was not just to kill Dexmon, but to inflict terror, pain and humiliation on him\". The court disregarded the psychiatric report which said that Chia was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time of the offence, on the basis that this report did not meet the minimum standards of expert evidence. Febri, 36, remains at large in Indonesia. The other accomplice Chua Leong Aik, 68, who drove the van, is serving a five-year jail term for charges of abduction and causing grievous hurt.

Mali-born Alassane, who obtained his Singapore citizenship in 2003 through the Family Ties Scheme, was on Dec 7 last year served with a notice of proposed deprivation of citizenship under Article 133(1) of the Constitution. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which did not name him, said on Wednesday (Jun 27) that minister K Shanmugam has decided against stripping the citizenship of a 43-year-old naturalised Singapore citizen based on the recommendations of an independent committee. Channel NewsAsia understands that the individual is Alassane. After his involvement in match-fixing was discovered, Alassane was detained and subsequently released on police supervision. “Given the severity of his criminal activities, and the extent of his involvement in the syndicate, the Minister for Home Affairs had assessed that it was not conducive to the public good that he should continue to be a citizen of Singapore. The minister had therefore considered depriving him of his Singapore citizenship,” MHA said. Alassane subsequently referred his case to a Citizenship Committee of Inquiry (CCOI), as provided for under the Constitution. The CCOI is an independent committee made up of private individuals appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs. Its role is to inquire into the cases referred to it, consider all evidence and representations, and recommend to the minister whether the proposed deprivation should proceed. After its inquiry, the committee recommended that the minister allow Alassane to keep his citizenship on compassionate grounds. It said it took into consideration Alassane’s strong family roots in Singapore, the service he has rendered to the community, as well as his conduct since his release. “The CCOI observed that he has been earning an honest living since his release from detention and he has not re-engaged in any criminal activities,” MHA said. “He also appeared to be very close to his children, playing an important role in their lives. His ex-wife and children had provided testimonials attesting to his love, attention and support for the children. The mosque where he performs voluntary community service has also attested to his good character.” The CCOI was of the view that he appeared to be a “changed man who would likely not re-offend”, the ministry added. “The minister has given due consideration to the CCOI’s assessment and recommendations, and has decided to give this individual another chance and not deprive him of his citizenship for now, subject to his conduct and behaviour,\" MHA said. “Should he be found engaging again in any act that is against the public good such as returning to crime, the minister will not hesitate to exercise powers on behalf of the Government to recommence proceedings to deprive him of his Singapore citizenship.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/gaye-alassane-singapore-citizenship-s-league-player-10474548"}, {"datetime": "27 Jun 2018 11:37AM", "tags": ["Geylang", "fire", "Ministry of Manpower"], "author": "", "title": "Geylang fire: 3 directors and companies fined S$153,000 for housing foreign workers in overcrowded premises", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three directors and their companies have been fined a total of S$153,000 for housing foreign workers in overcrowded private residential premises, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced on Wednesday (Jun 27).  Ong Lai Kar, director of Essential Clean and Care, Ong Huay Chew, director of Seng Foo Building Construction and Koh Kok Seng, director of Bestway Cleaning Services were convicted for not complying with Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) guidelines, after the 2014 Lorong 4 Geylang shophouse fire that killed four people.  The convicted parties have also been barred from employing foreign workers.  MOM said that while the cause of the fire was electrical in origin, investigations revealed there were 22 foreign workers residing in the shophouse, which exceeded URA's then occupancy cap of eight people.  \"Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations, employers are required to provide accommodation that comply with the various statutory requirements for their foreign workers,\" a press release stated.  Ong Lai Kar was prosecuted for abetting the other two employers to house their foreign workers in the overcrowded shophouse space, said MOM.   Authorities have also taken court action against the master tenant and owner of the property under the Planning Act and Fire Safety Act.  If convicted, they may face a maximum fine of S$200,000 under the Planning Act.

About 20,000 private homes are expected to be built from Government Land Sales (GLS) and en-bloc sites that are pending planning approval, and there are another 24,000 unsold units from projects that have received planning approval.  Additionally, more than 30,000 existing private homes are still vacant, the Ministry of National Development (MND) said in a press release. But the supply of land for private housing under the second half of the GLS programme will be kept at about the same level as that of the first half, as there continues to be strong demand for land from developers, the ministry said.  Transaction volumes are also rising, it added. Six land sites and another nine reserve sites will be released as part of the GLS programme in the second half of this year. These 15 sites can yield up to 8,040 private homes and 124,200 sq m of commercial space.  \"Taken together, the total supply in the pipeline will be able to meet home buyers’ demand over the next one to two years, and to meet our population’s housing needs,\" MND said. RESIDENTIAL SITES AT TAMPINES, SIMS DRIVE ON CONFIRMED LIST The six sites on the Confirmed List comprise four private residential sites including an Executive Condominium (EC), one \"white\" or mixed-use site and a hotel site. They can yield 2,705 private homes, including 695 EC units, 42,200 sq m of commercial space and 390 hotel rooms in total. The Reserve List comprises seven private residential sites (including one EC site) and two mixed-use sites. The seven sites can yield 5,335 private homes (including 515 EC units) and 82,000 sq m of commercial space and 540 hotel rooms.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n The confirmed sites are in areas like Tampines Avenue 10, Kampong Java Road, Sims Drive and Middle Road, while the reserve sites are in areas such as Clementi Avenue 1, Dairy Farm Walk, Tan Quee Lan Street and Yishun Avenue 9.  A mixed-use site in Pasir Ris Central will also be released. Other mixed-use sites on the Reserve List are in Marina View and Woodlands Square/Woodlands Avenue 2.  \"Sites for office development remained absent in the confirmed list in spite of the continued strengthening of CBD office rents,\" said real estate firm JLL, adding that the government is hoping for demand to spill into the suburbs to bring jobs closer to homes. The Woodlands mixed-use site will \"help to sustain the development momentum of Woodlands Regional Centre as a major commercial node outside the city\", said MND. This is in line with the authorities' objective of decentralising employment centres to bring job opportunities closer to home, it added. It also noted that the Singapore Tourism Board is optimistic about the country's tourism prospects, with a 6.2 per cent growth in international visitor arrivals last year. The Club Street and Marina View sites are expected to help provide additional hotel rooms to meet the demand.  ANALYSTS HAIL HOTEL SITE PROVISION Touching on this point, Mr Govinda Singh, Colliers International's executive director of valuation and advisory, Asia, said the Club Street and Marine View site offerings are aligned with his company's view \"that there is a shortage of hotel rooms in Singapore\". \"We believe the policymakers have been pragmatic in their approach towards the sale of hotel sites via GLS, holding off new site launches for a decade to allow the relatively large number of rooms in the market to be absorbed,\" he said.  \"Now that concerns of an oversupply in hotel rooms have largely receded, the Government has stepped forth to provide land options for the hotel sector.\" In addition, Ms Tricia Song, Head of Research for Singapore, Colliers International, noted that the Club Street site was the first hotel site to feature on the GLS Confirmed List since the second half of the 2008 land sales programme. The last time hotels were included on the Reserve List was in the second half of the 2013 land sales programme, according to Colliers research.  FEWER RESIDENTIAL SITES Ms Song also noted the lack of new EC sites in the latest announcement, with the only EC plot to feature on the Confirmed List being brought over from the Reserve List of the first half of the 2018 land sales programme.  \"Given the robust demand for Executive Condos, there was perhaps an expectation that the Government would place more EC sites in GLS H2 2018, possibly under the Reserve List,\" she said. \"However, this was not to be.\" JLL also noted that the three private residential sites and one white site in the Confirmed List will supply 2,010 residential units, a 14 per cent decline from the 1H2018 Confirmed List. \"Although the three GLS sites could help to meet demand from developers, it is uncertain as to whether they will mitigate optimistic land prices,\" it said.  \"They are also unlikely to dilute demand for collective sale sites, especially those in the prime districts for which there is keen interest.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/private-property-land-supply-government-sales-developers-10473948"}, {"datetime": "27 Jun 2018 06:32AM", "tags": ["Hyflux"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Hyflux’s Tuaspring plant: The ‘noose around the neck’ that needs to be sold, but can it be done?", "content": " SINGAPORE: Costing more than S$1 billion to build, the Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Plant was the landmark project that marked water treatment icon Hyflux’s foray into the energy business in 2011.  Hailed as the first water plant in Asia to be integrated with a power generator, it was expected to boost efficiency levels and reduce desalination costs among other things.  But for all the ambitions that it embodied, the Tuaspring project struggled to turn a profit and according to some market observers, eventually became the “noose” around Hyflux’s neck.  With the company under a court-supervised process to reorganise its liabilities and business, the need to divest a part or the entire stake in its single largest asset has become even more pressing.  At the court hearing on Jun 19 for its application of a six-month moratorium, Hyflux’s lawyers from WongPartnership stressed that Tuaspring still holds “significant value” and time was what the company needed to seal a deal for no less than a book value of S$1.3 billion.  This would help pay off secured project finance lender Maybank in full and leave about S$900 million for other debt and project investments, said Hyflux founder-CEO Olivia Lum in a Jun 14 affidavit.  However, with Tuaspring being placed on the market since last February and scheduled for a separate court hearing next month on its moratorium request, the question one might ask is: Can a buyer be found and if yes, at what price? BLEEDING ON WEAK ELECTRICITY PRICES To be sure, the Tuaspring desalination plant – the largest in Singapore – is a critical asset supplying 70 million gallons of desalinated water a day under a 25-year service concession agreement signed with PUB. The concession period expires in 2038.  However, the on-site gas turbine power plant, which produces electricity for the desalination plant and sells the excess to the national grid, has no such supply contracts. With an oversupply in the local power market weighing down electricity prices, Hyflux’s plan for “profits generated from the energy production facilities of the Tuaspring IWPP to comprise the bulk of the operating revenue” fizzled.  “With negative spark prices enduring across 2016 and 2017 except certain irregular spikes, the Tuaspring IWPP’s revenue was not able to cover its operating costs, much less the financing costs in relation to the Tuaspring loan,” said Ms Lum in the affidavit submitted to court.  The difference has been met by drawing from Hyflux Group’s cash, which in turn caused cash flow issues for other projects, according to another affidavit dated May 22.  For the full year ended Dec 31, 2017, Tuaspring registered a net loss of S$81.9 million and contributed in a big way to the company’s first annual loss since listing in 2001. As of April 30, 2018, its total liabilities amounted to S$537 million. Being mired in the red will likely have dampened investor interest in the integrated plant and even if there were, bids may have been way lower than what Hyflux was willing to accept, observers said.  “If your asset is loss-making, you won’t get optimal pricing for it,” said investment specialist S. Nallakaruppan. “Given how Tuaspring has been a noose around their neck, a divestment would have helped a lot so I’d be surprised if they rejected bids that were marginally below what they wanted.” “ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT”? But things could be in for a change, at least according to Ms Lum.  Spark spreads, which refer to the difference between the price received for electricity produced and the cost of natural gas needed to produce that electricity, have increased to a positive amount since February and have stabilised through May unlike previous spikes, she said in her affidavit.  Though still unable to cover financing costs, Tuaspring has been generating sufficient revenue to cover short-run marginal costs since March.  Ms Lum described the positive movement of spark spreads as an “encouraging development”, alongside projections for growing electricity demand and decreasing supply with the retirement of steam plants here. With that, she wrote that she is confident “the Tuaspring IWPP can be divested at a price around or above its present S$1.3 billion book value to a suitable purchaser” if given sufficient time.  Hyflux is currently in talks with four parties on a private and confidential basis, she added.  This optimism, however, is not shared by analysts Channel NewsAsia spoke to.  Describing book value as “backward-looking”, Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen said Hyflux needs to be “realistic” and should “maintain some flexibility” with its expectations.  “The company has been so firm on divesting at book value… which does not take into account factors like the losses of Tuaspring, market conditions and uncertainty in electricity prices,” said the accounting professor from the National University of Singapore (NUS). “Perhaps a re-evaluation could open up more potential buyers.”  Echoing that, Assoc Prof Lawrence Loh from the NUS Business School said: “The proposed sale of Tuaspring will determine the recovery values for Hyflux’s stakeholders but for the bidders, it’s not going to be a charity show.”  That said, Tuaspring, with its value as a strategic water asset, is not without suitors.  “Logical guesses”, according to Assoc Prof Loh, would include foreign and local companies that can “derive synergy and extract value” from the purchase. In Singapore, this could be Sembcorp and Keppel which have dipped their toes into the water and energy industries.  The other scenario is a holding company, such as state investment firm Temasek Holdings, stepping in to make the purchase. Given that Hyflux is involved in the strategic water sector, Assoc Prof Loh said “that option cannot be ruled out” though it should not send the “wrong signal of a bailout”.  “We cannot send the message that if you are in a strategic industry, you can by all means go and take high risks and if things go down, there will be a sugar daddy to bail you out. That is not how businesses are run in Singapore.” MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES Beyond Tuaspring, Hyflux has also been trying to sell the smaller Tianjin Dagang Desalination Plant in China. It is similarly working to secure a S$200 million cash injection that would help fund construction for its ongoing TuasOne and Qurayyat projects.  But while asset divestments and seeking new sources of liquidity would help to fix Hyflux’s cash crunch, the fundamental problem that it needs to deal with ahead lies in its business model.  Assoc Prof Loh said the company has been “burning (itself) through a very highly-leveraged approach towards running the business”.  “The liquidity is not at all well-managed,” he said, citing how Hyflux has a debt burden that is way more than its available cash position.  In Ms Lum’s Jun 14 affidavit, she mentioned that the total bank debt for the entire Hyflux Group stands at about S$1.84 billion with subordinated debt of S$900 million. This excludes S$265 million of medium-term notes.  On the other hand, Hyflux and its four subsidiaries placed under moratorium hold a cash balance of S$18.6 million as of Jun 4, 2018.  Agreeing, iFast’s senior fixed income analyst Ang Chung Yuh cited how the former star company has been operating in a negative operating cash flow situation since 2010.  “After all these years of running huge cash outflows, it is probably clear that their business model of building up assets then monetising them is not profitable,” he said. “This will be something that they need to rethink if they can implement their restructuring.”  For Assoc Prof Mak, Hyflux would also need to “pick and choose” when it comes to its involvements in future projects and overseas markets.  Citing the design-build-own-operate (DBOO) model of Tuaspring, he explained: “Hyflux tends to be involved in all parts of the value chain but moving forward, they can look at where their strengths are and focus on that. You don’t necessarily have to be involved in the entire supply chain.”  Having expanded overseas aggressively, Hyflux will also need to start scrutinising its risk management practices, which ties in with the adequacy of corporate governance, added Prof Mak.  The corporate governance hawk said “red flags” include the practice of giving share options to independent directors and having former employees sitting on the board. Some independent directors have also “stayed for far too long”.  “All these tell us of a board that the founder is very comfortable with and not people with different viewpoints. But boards need people who will challenge decisions constructively.”  Prof Mak also questioned if Ms Lum, who is also executive chairman and heads the board’s investment committee, has taken on too many hats.  “Sometimes, founders find it difficult to let go. By all accounts, Ms Lum is a brilliant entrepreneur and has been recognised for her engineering acumen but you can’t be good at everything,” the NUS professor told Channel NewsAsia.  “Maybe moving forward, she will need to rethink her role in the company. Instead of taking on so many roles, she can focus on what she is really good at.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-s-tuaspring-plant-the-noose-around-the-neck-that-needs-to-10468128"}, {"datetime": "27 Jun 2018 06:29AM", "tags": ["parenting", "CNA Insider", "families", "early childhood development", "children"], "author": "Foo Koong Hean", "title": "Commentary: Raising 7 children on S$3,000 a month in Singapore, and a tale of constructive parenting", "content": " SINGAPORE: Bringing up a family of seven children in Singapore on a budget of S$3,000 a month is scary and unthinkable for many. It’s no wonder many view this choice the Hengs have made with sceptism and as irresponsible parenting. Why? In general, most Singaporean households gun for a small family size of three children or fewer to ensure maximum parental effort and optimal growth in each of their children given rising costs of living. Just as lower student-to-teacher ratios are often cited as ingredients to a successful education system, conventional wisdom suggests that smaller families lead to greater resources and more parental support being devoted to each child, with less sibling rivalry as a result. If parents dedicate effort to developing each of their children, to help them understand themselves, the people around them and the world better, and nurture strong values and virtues that put them in good stead to lead a fulfilling life, having less makes sense. But in a competitive country like Singapore, the problem is that most couples have less kids because they do not believe their children can succeed in a hyper-competitive society without constant intervention and frequent tending to. Helicopter parenting creates a larger vicious cycle for it produces a population of sheltered adults dependent on someone else swooping in to save them when they meet with new challenges.  They may become self-centred people who put themselves first, and live with a sense of entitlement.

It turned out to be a mistake. She is still paying for those items today, but the value of her debt has ballooned to S$30,000 over the years. “It has really hit me. I think, for now, if I don’t have the money, I won't buy the thing. I’ll save up,” said a regretful Linda, who declined to use her real name. She is among a group of people who have bought on hire purchase from electronics and furnishing retailers in Singapore, lured by the low monthly repayments. But few realise that the interest rate can be as high as 33.99 per cent per annum, as the programme Talking Point discovers. And that does not include late-payment charges. (Watch the episode here.) While there are interest-free instalment plans, consumers need a credit card and must spend a minimum of S$500. Those who do not qualify might turn to the retailers’ payment plans for their big-ticket items – without doing their sums. NO FINANCIAL SENSE? One furnishing store, for example, offers an instalment plan with 26.9 per cent interest per annum, plus a 1 per cent late-charge interest per day. An employee from the store said that those who take these plans “don’t have money”. GYC Financial Advisory vice president William Cai, who helped Talking Point to calculate the final amount consumers would be paying for some items at 26.9 per cent interest, does not think these instalment plans make financial sense. A television that costs S$399 would eventually cost some S$720 based on repayments of S$20 over 36 months. That is 80 per cent more than its original price. A refrigerator that retails at S$899 would set you back S$2,108, if you pay S$35 a month for five years – a 134.5 per cent price jump. “What I’d rather do is to look for a really cheap brand or really cheap second-hand product. Or if I can't afford it, I’d get one of my friends to … help me out,” said Mr Cai. “It’s better than paying so much on interest.” But are retailers offering unfair interest rates? “These types of loans are unsecured, like credit cards … Based on that as a reference, it’s fair,” said Mr Cai, who noted that credit card interest rates typically range between 24 and 26 per cent. Consumer products also depreciate fast. “The value could go to nearly zero in a short period of time, and the retailers face quite a high risk getting involved in such a business. So I’d say it’s pretty fair,” he added. What he would like to see, however, is more clarity for consumers, whereby retailers compute everything for them so that they know the total amount of interest they would be paying. In a Talking Point street poll, most of those surveyed said they would not take out these instalment plans if they knew how much they could be paying. But one respondent reasoned: “An air-conditioner is probably a necessity because of our hot weather … so to pay, like, S$100-plus a month with a monthly salary of, say, S$1,600, I think makes sense to (people whose income isn’t high).” ‘MEETING BASIC FAMILY NEEDS’ Courts Singapore said it offers zero per cent instalment tie-ups with the major bank credit cards, but recognises that such options typically have a minimum income threshold, which not all consumers can meet. “Courts’ intention is to serve such customers who need to purchase big-ticket items that meet basic family and living needs,” said the retailer, which offers them interest rates ranging from zero per cent to 33.99 per cent per annum. When asked if its interest rates were fair, it said the rates are benchmarked against the consumer credit market and “assessed based on verification of the risk profile of the customer, through reference and credit bureau checks”. The company said its staff would ensure that customers “have the full details they need to make an educated financial decision” during the application process. Should customers face financial difficulties during the repayment process, the retailer works with them on a “suitable repayment plan”, including restructuring their repayments into lower monthly instalments “to keep within the customer’s budget”. Courts added that non-repayments form “a very small percentage” of its FlexiPlan customers, and they are handled on a case-by-case basis. Its late-payment term charges are at 18 per cent per annum for two of its plans, or at the same rate of the deferred term charge for other plans. The charges apply when an account is more than three months in arrears, and only to the overdue instalments. Another retailer, Gain City, offers instalment plans for air-conditioners, with interest rates of up to 18 per cent, but only 1 per cent of its customers are on this plan. Gain City senior manager (special projects) Sheena Hu said this caters for those who “genuinely” need help buying an air-conditioner, such as families with seniors, children or persons with skin allergies. She said the retailer offers the lowest rates in the market and keeps “all aspects of the hire purchase fees low vis-a-vis other retailers”. It has only had one default case so far, owing to its “prudent assessment” of applications. We don’t have any cases, to date, of customers who are unable to pay up for the remaining payments because our customers are … utilising hire purchase due to a genuine need and not for frivolous reasons. \"And our approach to potential default cases is conciliatory,” said Ms Hu. She added that staff would contact the customers if there are any failed Giro deductions and follow up on the expected payment date, the penalty and late interest to be incurred. But it does not send monthly statements unless requested. FALLING ON TROUBLED TIMES Most of these instalment plans would work if the buyer has a steady income, but what happens in troubled times, when making those repayments is a struggle? The Debt Advisory Centre, which helps individuals with debt problems, said that about 20 per cent of its cases are related to payments by instalment. Out of this 20 per cent, about 65 to 75 per cent are from the low-income segment. Mr Saiful Nizam Jemain, the centre’s social services manager, said: “The retailers provide credit facilities that don’t discriminate against income levels. So these low-income earners are attracted to them because … they’re able to get these items within their means. While some retailers indicate the item’s cost at the end of the payment period, many do not inform the consumer of the penalty charges for defaulting on payments, or provide monthly statements, he added. “If you own a credit card, you’d get a statement at the end of every month, (telling you) how much you owe and, if you had paid late for the last month, the penalty charges,” he noted. It is hard to say how many people in Singapore use instalment plans, as retailers Talking Point approached did not give exact figures. In December, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said that since January last year, an average of 4,000 borrowers a month have increased their unsecured debts to above 12 times their monthly income from the previous month. But, it added, “the vast majority of unsecured borrowers” are prudent. For Linda, who could make her monthly payments at the beginning, things changed after her husband met with an accident. “He wasn’t working for almost a year. So from that moment in time, I started to default,” she explained. She has almost S$20,000 left to pay, which includes late-payment charges, and has received letters from the retailer’s lawyer demanding payment and SMSs from a debt collector warning that if she defaults again, debt collectors would go to her home. She had asked one of the salespersons about the interest incurred if she were to default. “He only told me, ‘Only a little bit – never mind, we can understand,’” she said ruefully.

The rules, which take effect immediately, fits with Singapore's moves to reinvent itself as a fintech and new technology hub. SGX lost out on the initial public offering (IPO) of Manchester United to New York in 2012 because it could not obtain approval for a dual-class share structure. It also comes two months after Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) added dual-class shares to its IPO rules. HKEx launched from April 30 new rules designed to attract companies with a market cap of not less than HK$10 billion (US$1.27 billion) while Singapore will allow firms valued at S$300 million to list with dual-class shares. Dual-class share listings (DCS), which are allowed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, give extra voting power to protect executives from shareholders obsessed with short-term gains. The structure has been embraced by companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and high-valued tech startups known as unicorns. But they have also come in for criticism from corporate governance advocates, who have warned of its potential abuse by company insiders.  The changes, which follow two rounds of public consultation, will help SGX join the global league in terms of offerings, the bourse operator said. “SGX today joins global exchanges in Canada, Europe and the US where companies led by founder-entrepreneurs who require funding for a rapid ramp-up of the business while retaining the ability to execute on a long-term strategy, are able to list. Investors who understand and agree with the business model and management of DCS companies will also have more choice,” said Mr Loh Boon Chye, CEO of SGX. Safeguards have been in place to address specific risks, including capping each multiple voting share at 10 votes and limiting the holders of multiple voting shares to named individuals, or permitted holder groups whose scope must be specified at IPO. SGX also requires “sunset clauses”, including requiring that MV shares be converted to ordinary voting (OV) shares under circumstances the company must stipulate at the time of the IPO. SGX has also specified a range of instances that require shareholders to vote via an enhanced voting process where all shares including multiple voting shares carry one vote each.  These instances include the appointment and removal of independent non-executive directors, a reverse takeover and the winding-up or delisting of the issuer.  “SGX’s framework for dual-class share (DCS) structures strikes a balance between supporting high-growth companies, and having in place safeguards to mitigate governance risks associated with such structures. DCS listings will broaden the range of investment options for investors and add vibrancy to Singapore’s capital markets,” a spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-exchange-rules-listing-dual-class-shares-10471876"}, {"datetime": "26 Jun 2018 06:16PM", "tags": ["death", "Punggol Reservoir"], "author": "", "title": "Body found floating in Punggol Reservoir", "content": " SINGAPORE: The body of a 28-year-old man was found floating at Punggol Reservoir on Monday (Jun 25) evening.  It was earlier reported that his body was found at Lower Seletar Reservoir, but police later clarified that it was discovered at Punggol Reservoir.

From 5pm on Monday to 4pm on Tuesday, CASE received 232 complaints against oBike. Prior to that, the association had received just 27 since the start of the year, it said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia. According to the watchdog, consumers mostly complained that they \"did not receive a refund for their deposits\" from oBike despite requests.  Channel NewsAsia reported on Monday that oBike users seeking refunds of their mandatory deposits – S$19 and S$49 for students and other users respectively – were left in the lurch following the company's announcement.  Some said the “refund deposit” option on the oBike app was removed, and had trouble with internet connection when they tried to access the app.CASE told Channel NewsAsia it will “follow up with oBike” on the deposit refunds and urged consumers with unresolved disputes to contact the consumer watchdog for further assistance. It added that consumers who made payment via credit card to oBike within the last 120 days \"can consider lodging a chargeback claim with their card issuer as soon as possible\". In its statement to Channel NewsAsia on Monday, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said affected consumers should make a request for the refund of their deposits or subscription fees with oBike if they have not already done so. oBike has not responded to queries from Channel NewsAsia. oBIKE OFFICE EMPTY, SIGN TAKEN DOWN  When Channel NewsAsia visited the oBike Asia headquarters at Commonwealth Lane on Tuesday afternoon (Jun 26), the office was locked and looked vacant.  The only indication that the office was previously occupied by oBike was the company's cardboard poster that was placed against one of the windows.  Two people who worked at offices adjacent and opposite oBike's unit told Channel NewsAsia that the oBike sign outside the door was removed about a month ago.  One of them added that the oBike office was previously occupied by 10-12 people, who were mostly interns.  \"I was friendly with one of the women working there and she told me that only two employees were working full-time. The rest were all student interns,\" said an offshore ship broker who declined to be named.  In a report released on Tuesday afternoon, Mediacorp's TODAY quoted oBike's co-founder Edward Chen as saying that \"he has left matters to the local team and also the legal team and (liquidator)\".  On whether oBike would offer refunds on the users' deposits, the report quoted Mr Chen, who is based in Shanghai, as saying that there was an \"existing plan for the whole process\".  TODAY added that Mr Chen declined to elaborate, and referred the news outlet to oBike's Singapore-based team and lawyers.  LTA said on Monday it “will be engaging oBike\" on its \"exit plans\", including the removal of shared bicycles from public places.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sharp-increase-in-complaints-against-obike-ceased-case-10471012"}, {"datetime": "26 Jun 2018 05:19PM", "tags": ["Rochor Centre"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'The old will have to go': Rochor Centre demolition work begins", "content": "  SINGAPORE: Mr Alex Kwok grew up in one of the four rainbow-coloured Housing and Development Board blocks which make up Rochor Centre, but as demolition work began on Tuesday (Jun 26), he was stoic about the iconic flats being torn down. \"There's nothing we can do,\" said Mr Kwok, who owns an optical shop on the first floor of Sim Lim Tower. \"Things have to change.

Those who did not have the jab may be subjected to vaccination, isolation or surveillance in Singapore, and travellers who refuse to comply may be returned to their place of embarkation. Under the proposed changes, authorities will be given \"discretionary powers\" to turn back unvaccinated foreign travellers, without first offering vaccination, isolation or surveillance. \"This is in line with international practice,\" said the ministry in a media release. \"This discretion will be exercised judiciously, in scenarios where it is impractical to offer vaccination, isolation or surveillance,\" it added. \"Unwell travellers arriving in Singapore will not be turned away, and will continue to receive medical attention as needed.\" CONTINUED EFFORTS TO PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES The proposal is among several changes that MOH is seeking public feedback on.  The ministry noted that infectious diseases such as Avian Influenza, Ebola, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are serious public health threats globally. \"As a major global trade and travel hub, it is imperative that we remain vigilant to public health threats, and safeguard the health of Singaporeans by protecting the community against new and emerging infectious diseases, both locally and overseas,\" said MOH. Another proposed amendment to the IDA would allow the ministry to stop people who break isolation or movement restriction orders from leaving Singapore.  \"Instead of arresting them, MOH will also be empowered to take necessary measures, including the use of physical means, to reinstate the isolation or movement restriction order to mitigate the risk of disease spread posed by the person,\" the ministry said. It added that a \"risk-stratified approach\" will be used to manage individuals with different levels of public health risk.  Those considered lower-risk will be allowed to visit certain defined places without strict home quarantine. They may be allowed to perform some job roles instead of facing a blanket stop-work order if certain conditions are met.  Under the amended Act, MOH said it would also be able to enlist the assistance of Singapore-based mobile operators, air, sea and land transport operators and port service and transport facility operators to disseminate health advisories to visitors or those who have visited areas affected by an infectious diseases.  Members of the public can give their feedback on the proposed amendments from Jun 27 to Aug 7.  The public consultation paper can be found on REACH and on the MOH website from 9am on Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/unvaccinated-foreign-travellers-may-be-denied-entry-to-singapore-10470988"}, {"datetime": "26 Jun 2018 02:09PM", "tags": ["big data", "predictive intelligence", "marketing"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Edelman and EDB want to unlock companies’ ability to use data for good", "content": " SINGAPORE: How can data be used to address a real-life issue like road rage and its impact on the road safety conditions in one’s country? That was the problem statement oil company Shell put forward to communications company Edelman in 2017, as it tried to tackle road rage in Malaysia where statistics showed that an average of 18 people die every day in road accidents, said Mr Yeelim Lee, general manager of Edelman Predictive Intelligence Centre, during a recent interview with Channel NewsAsia. In order to understand some of the causes for road rage among drivers, wearable tracking devices were handed to 300 volunteer drivers during a two-week period last April. These emotion tracking wristbands measured biometric information such as heart and breath rate, mood, sleep and exercise, said Mr Lee. “This was to understand their peak stress periods,” he explained, adding that such data was meshed with other data sets such as the weather, traffic conditions as well as driving behaviour like acceleration and braking via the Shell Motorist app. In total, the study captured more than 150,000 data points from various sources, he added. Having mined the insights, Shell was then informed enough to send its service staff in Malaysia to undergo hospitality training that could mitigate against road rage. The executive also said certain foods were also recommended to various service outlets at petrol kiosks as a result of the information collected. For example, in the profile of a “smooth and steady driver”, Shell said such motorists have a daily coffee, stays hydrated and carries a bottle of water in the car and eats a portion of fruit and two portions of vegetables each day. The outlets would then be stocked with the relevant products to encourage such a driver profile among its visitors, Mr Lee explained. “The aim of the campaign was to gain insights which could inform motorists of what factors affect them on the road,” he said. “Empowered with this knowledge, they would be better equipped to make positive behavioural choices to improve their journeys.” Shell, in turn, also saw an increase in their social reach, brand preference and sales, said the executive, but was not able to disclose exact figures. Yet, the communications agency was keen to stress that their methods of enhancing a brand’s public reach does not cross the threshold of alarming customers, who are the recipients of any possible campaign. Its global COO Matt Harrington, who was at the same interview, shared that the data it analyses is always anonymised. The datasets are used to identify and understand how consumers are behaving, rather than targeting a specific user for any specific instance, he added. “It is not micro-targeting,” he asserted. The act of micro-targeting users has taken on a negative connotation in recent times, following news of how UK data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica reportedly harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebooks users and used it to profile individual users and targeted them with personalised political advertisements during the 2016 US presidential elections.  ALIGNED INTERESTS This collaboration with the oil company is an example of how Edelman wants to unlock the inherent potential of data sitting in one’s business and use it for good, Mr Harrington said. The Edelman Predictive Intelligence Centre (EPIC) in Singapore was launched last week, in partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board. It is a three-year strategic collaboration to research and develop new approaches to communications marking planning using predictive and intelligent technologies, the company said then. This is the communications firm’s first such centre of excellence, and it is currently staffed with 13 people. There are plans to increase the headcount to 24 by 2021. Mr Lee, who oversees the centre, said the planning and research work is done here even if the companies it is working with are based elsewhere. Asked why Edelman decided to house its predictive intelligence centre here, Mr Harrington said there are “aligned interests” between both parties. For one, Singapore has expressed interest in being a safe data harbour for the region while Edelman is compliant with industry standards around data privacy such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which kicked in last month. Singapore has also been strong proponents of data science and artificial intelligence, meaning there’s a pipeline of talent coming through here. “With our centre of excellence, these graduates will have the platform to practice what they’ve learnt,” Mr Harrington said. These sentiments were echoed by Mr Kelvin Wong, assistant managing director of EDB, who said the new centre is a boost to the country’s efforts to grow data-enabled marketing innovation capabilities. “This is in line with the professional services industry transformation map launched in January this year, which seeks to equip the workforce with specialised skillsets in high-growth areas such as data science, analytics, and artificial intelligence,” Mr Wong added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/edelman-and-edb-want-to-unlock-companies-ability-to-use-data-for-10470820"}, {"datetime": "26 Jun 2018 01:34PM", "tags": ["court", "sex"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Retiree who sexually assaulted boy in toilet has jail term increased to 11 years after appeal", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 63-year-old retiree who sexually assaulted a boy in a public toilet two years ago had his jail sentence increased to 11 years in the Court of Appeal on Tuesday (Jun 26). Chua Hock Leong was sentenced to a minimum mandatory eight years' jail in July last year for sexually assaulting the boy in a public toilet at Tampines Eco Green in 2016. The boy, who was 12 at the time of the assault, has an IQ of 75 - just five points above the threshold for intellectual disability. Chua, who had claimed trial, cannot be caned because he is above 50. The boy cannot be named. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal, made up of Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Tay Yong Kwang, increased Chua's jail sentence to 11 years, including six months in lieu of caning. Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang said he took into account the impact sexual offences have on victims psychologically and emotionally. As a result of the incident, the boy became withdrawn and no longer enjoyed going out, the judge said. He has also become \"very afraid of talking to elderly men\", the court heard. On Jan 27, 2016, the boy, who was then in Secondary 1, was waiting for his friend at the void deck of a block of flats in Tampines when Chua walked by. Chua gave the boy S$2, who proceeded to follow him to Tampines Eco Green, a public park close by. At the park, the boy went to relieve himself in a public toilet for the handicapped. While he was doing so, Chua opened the faulty door and asked the boy three times to perform a sexual act on him. The boy refused and tried to escape. Chua then performed a sexual act on the boy. After about a minute, the boy \"felt pain\", pushed Chua away and fled.  Justice Choo Han Teck had tried and convicted Chua in July last year on a charge of sexual assault by penetration of a person, sentencing him to eight years in prison.

The judge also added on an additional jail term in lieu of caning, noting that Chua was 61 years old at the time of the offence. \"Most offenders of a similar age would know that they cannot be caned,\" he said, adding that an additional jail sentence was necessary and appropriate for deterrence.

He posted the comment on Facebook on Tuesday (Jun 26) after Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday that his government needs to renegotiate the water supply agreement with Singapore, describing it as “too costly”. The 1962 Water Agreement is an agreement guaranteed by both governments in the 1965 Separation Agreement which was registered with the United Nations. The terms of the agreement give Singapore full and exclusive rights to draw up to a maximum of 250 million gallons (mgd) of water per day from the Johore River. In return, Johor is entitled to buy treated water of up to 2 per cent of the raw water extracted by Singapore on any given day, or about 5 mgd if Singapore draws its full entitlement of water from the Johor River. Singapore pays 3 sen per thousand gallons of raw water and sells treated water to Johor at 50 sen per thousand gallons. In a Channel NewsAsia interview, Dr Mahathir called the price of water being sold to Singapore \"ridiculous\". \"I think it is manifestly ridiculous that we should sell water at 3 sen per thousand gallons. That was okay way back in the 1990s or 1930s. But now what can you buy with 3 sen? Nothing,\" he told Channel NewsAsia in an exclusive interview. In his Facebook post, Mr Tan said: “As a friend and neighbour, we do what we can. But being friendly and supportive doesn’t mean that we should accede to whims and fancies to show sincerity.  “When one wants his way and doesn’t get it, it isn’t because we aren’t friendly. It’s because it needs to be fair, equitable and consistent for our people. That’s the basis on which equals conduct business.” A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC In his Facebook post on Monday, former Ambassador-at-Large Bilahari Kausikan suggested that Prime Minister Mahathir is raising the water issue only as a diversionary tactic in preparation for asking for a waiver or reduction of the compensation due to Singapore if Malaysia formally cancels the high-speed rail project between the two countries. Mr Kausikan is also a former Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He said Dr Mahathir’s “intention is to make the Singapore government look unreasonable hoping, first, that Singaporeans will pressure our government on his behalf, and, second, to set up an alibi with his own people\". The Malaysian Prime Minister \"knows full well that the price of water was set by an international agreement under the terms of which Malaysia also buys treated water from Singapore at a low price, and buys considerably more than it is entitled to buy under the terms of the agreement”, Mr Bilahari added. He said Malaysia would not agree to the terms of the agreement unless it is getting a good deal. “We have gone through this umpteen times when he was last PM. He knows we are not going to change our position,” Mr Bilahari said. “The reason is simple: if we allow Malaysia to change the terms of solemn international agreements anytime the terms of the agreement become inconvenient to them, where will it end?” “All this is out of Dr M’s standard play-book. Singaporeans should not be deceived. Good neighbourliness ought to be a two-way street,” Mr Bilahari added. The water issue: What's at stake and how did we get here?

Thirty-eight students from 18 schools used their artistic talents to create designs for the funpacks, which come in the form of tote bags this year.   The artworks, featuring imagery such as the Singapore skyline and ordinary Singaporeans, are expressions of what Singapore means to the students and their hopes for the country as it celebrates its 53rd birthday. There funpacks come in 18 different designs, with names such as Concrete Jungle, Harmony in Diversity and Mao Shan Wang.  “It is really wonderful to me that this year’s National Day, we also incorporate students from the special needs school,” President Halimah Yacob said on Tuesday (Jun 26) at the unveiling of the funpacks. “That’s really significant because ... these funpacks are going to thousands of Singaporeans. That spreads the message and that’s really heartwarming.” Mdm Halimah said she hopes the involvement of special education students is not a one-off. \"I hope that this is a strong message sent throughout society for everyone to play their part to support our special needs community, because they do have talents,\" she added. \"It’s not a question of we just want to showcase them. No, they have special talents and capabilities that many of us don’t have.\" For Nurin Qurratu’ain Sukor, a hotel and accommodation services student from APSN Delta Senior School, the design process took three “painstaking” sessions. The 19-year-old, who designed Concrete Jungle, started with a pencil sketch, then added water colours in red and blue, and finally outlined it with a black marker. Qurratu’ain chose the Marine Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay because it made up Singapore’s skyline, and a fighter jet because it reminded her of last year’s NDP. This year's funpack comprises 22 items, including a light bubble and a placard that spectators can use to participate in the parade. Spectators can express themselves by writing messages on the placards, which have red and white sides and will be used in a “massive” audience formation during the show. The funpack also comes with a souvenir magazine filled with fun facts about NDP 2018, and an art booklet showcasing all 18 funpack artworks, the artists’ stories and the inspirations behind their designs. “We wanted to bring everyone on board,” said logistics and finance chairman Senior Lieutenant Colonel (SLTC) Quek Yew Sing, who also emphasised that involving special education students is in line with this year’s NDP theme of representing Singaporeans from all walks of life. “Given that the funpacks are well sought-after, it will raise awareness and bring recognition to our young talent.” As for the snacks in the funpacks, Khong Guan biscuits and salted egg yolk chips make a comeback from last year. There is also a muffin and cream bun. The tote bags come with a zip, shoulder sling and an additional long sling. A total of 252,000 funpacks will be distributed at collection points at The Float @ Marina Bay. SLTC Quek said organisers have looked at favourite funpack items, including snacks, from previous years and brought them back to reduce wastage. \"We've kept it to a bare minimum in terms of the items, and it comes with a waste bag to allow people to bag and throw properly,\" he said. \"We looked into the details of what made people keep the bag, that it has to be meaningful. It’s very practical, it’s a tote bag design which can be used for all walks of life.\" NDP OF \"GREAT SIGNIFICANCE\": HALIMAH Mdm Halimah, who will be attending the NDP for the first time as President, said she always looks forward to the \"special day\". She recalled the old days when she stood by the side of the road in her housing estate just to see the parade passing through. \"There was one day when it was raining heavily, but we still went, (it) doesn’t matter,\" she said. \"You can feel the warmth of the people attending the parade. \"It has great significance for us and I hope that it will be a day where no matter what we feel or think, we will feel that we share something in common.\" Additional reporting by Noella Chye", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-funpacks-special-education-students-design-artworks-2018-10470554"}, {"datetime": "26 Jun 2018 11:35AM", "tags": ["CPF", "HDB", "home protection scheme"], "author": "", "title": "About 510,000 CPF members to pay less for home protection insurance scheme ", "content": " SINGAPORE: About 510,000 Central Provident Fund (CPF) members who are covered under the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) will get a reduction on their annual premiums from Jul 1 onwards.  This constitutes 95 per cent of HPS members who are paying annual premiums, with three in four of these members getting reductions of 10 per cent or more, the CPF Board said in a news release on Tuesday (Jun 26).  With the premiums reduction, a 32-year-old male member who is servicing a S$200,000 housing loan from HDB for 30 years will pay a reduced annual premium of S$183.20. This is equivalent to a 15 per cent reduction, said CPF Board.  \"Members who join the HPS scheme on or after Jul 1, 2018 will get to enjoy the new rates, while existing members paying annual HPS premiums will pay the reduced premiums when they renew or adjust their HPS coverage on or after Jul 1, 2018,\" it added.   HPS is a mortgage-reducing insurance that protects CPF members and their families against losing their HDB flats in the event of death, terminal illness or total permanent disability before their housing loans are paid up.

It may be that “why” is usually not explained and if it was, explanations may have been very technical. Such advice is also often ignored as these actions seem time-consuming yet ineffective. But basic cybersecurity need not be rocket science. How you secure your smartphone or computer should be no different from how you secure your physical house. You protect your assets in your home by preventing unsolicited and unauthorised access to your house. Similarly, protecting the personal information on your smartphone or computer requires restricting access to the data on it. So why do many neglect to do so? The main difference is that a house is visible whereas the digital world is not. Human nature makes us more protective of things we can see, so more effort is naturally exercised when it comes to the protection of our physical assets compared to our digital ones. Where many have picked up bad cybersecurity habits, such lax, sloppy actions would not be conceivable in the context of securing our physical homes. There are four statements in particular that seem ridiculous in the latter context, and yet are surprisingly common sins in the realm of cybersecurity. 1.I AM USING A 3-DIGIT NUMERIC PADLOCK FOR MY FRONT DOOR Imagine a door locked by a 3-digit numeric padlock. How secure can it be given that there are only 1,000 possible combinations between 000 and 999 inclusively? If it takes a thief one second to try one combination, it will take 1,000 seconds or less than 17 minutes to open the lock. In the digital world, the computational capabilities brought about by the advancement of computers and cloud computing mean that thousands or even millions of combinations can be attempted every second. It is thus important to ensure that your password is of a sufficient length so that it will be more difficult for a hacker to succeed using similar “brute-force” attacks by running through all the possible permutations of your password. 2. THE COMBINATION FOR MY HOUSE DOOR IS 1234567890 Even if the password is of a sufficient length, the use of smart computer algorithms as well as artificial intelligence can also shorten the time for a hacker to crack a password. These algorithms utilise dictionaries of commonly-used words, certain patterns of characters or numbers, or even personal data mined from the internet to make intelligent guesses of your passwords. Simple but long passwords such as “MyNameIsStevenWong” take less than three days for a computer to crack, according to an online password analyser developed by a non-profit online community of cybersecurity experts. There are many ways to create a secure and complex password. One simple method is to use a phrase that you can remember and construct the password using the first character of every word while keeping any number or special character in the phrase. To illustrate this, using the phrase “My name is Steven Wong and creating complex password can be simple in 2018!”, the password “MniSWaccpcbsi2018!” can be generated. 3. I HAVE PLACED THE KEY UNDER THE FLOOR MAT  Imagine you have installed the strongest lock to protect your house but have the habit of leaving the key under the floor mat of your front door for convenience sake. This will effectively render the lock useless and make your otherwise secured house vulnerable to theft. Likewise, you may have created a very strong password but chose to write it on a piece of post-it and stick it onto your computer monitor or the back of your keyboard. How secure is that? A common excuse is that there are too many passwords to remember and some company policies are for passwords to be changed every few months. Writing it down seems to be the easiest way to “store” passwords but this is also the easiest way for someone else to obtain your passwords. It might be better to use a password manager to securely store all your passwords. A password manager is like a secured key cabinet used to store the different keys in a building. You then need to ensure that the lock to the cabinet is strong. Likewise, the login for your password manager needs to be secured by a strong password. 4. THERE IS A LARGE HOLE IN THE WALL AND I AM NOT FIXING IT.  If there is a large hole in the wall that enables an intruder to enter your house and bypass all the doors and locks, most people will immediately patch the wall up. However, when there are similar vulnerabilities in their smartphone apps or computer software, these don’t seem to be given as much urgency or priority. This was evident in major cybersecurity incidents such as the WannaCry ransomware outbreak last year where over 200,000 computers around the world were compromised, resulting in billions of dollars in economic loss. Unlike the patching of walls in your homes which can be expensive and may take a few days, the patching of bugs in your software and other fixes that may come with it is mostly free and takes at most a few minutes. Most modern software also have automatic patching in-built so there is no good reason why your software should not be patched with the most recent update. EASY TO IMPLEMENT Basic cybersecurity is definitely not rocket science. Unlike securing a house, the methods discussed are mostly free and easy to implement. Given that 81 per cent of data breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords according to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report in 2017, adhering to such simple cybersecurity practices will definitely go a long way towards better securing your assets in a digital world.  Dr Steven Wong Kai Juan is president of the Association of Information Security Professionals and programme director for the information security degree programme at the Singapore Institute of Technology.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/deadly-cybersecurity-sins-most-of-us-are-guilty-of-10446028"}, {"datetime": "26 Jun 2018 06:31AM", "tags": ["Great Singapore Sale", "shopping", "online shopping", "Orchard Road"], "author": "Wong Pei Ting", "title": "The Big Read: The not-so-Great Singapore Sale — after 25 years, once-premier shopping event is now left in the dust  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Great Singapore Sale (GSS) marks its Silver Jubilee this year, but one can hardly tell while taking a walk along Orchard Road — Singapore’s prime shopping belt — or visiting any suburban malls. There is barely a buzz since the annual two-month campaign started on Jun 8, and some shopping centres are half-empty even during weekends. With the Singapore retail scene under siege from the rise of e-commerce, the GSS has remained stuck in time, in the words of shoppers, retailers and experts, and has failed to evolve with latest consumer trends. In 2016, after three consecutive years of decline in retail sales during the GSS period, Singapore Retailers Association (SRA) president R Dhinakaran publicly broached the need to re-examine the GSS’ direction, as he revealed plans in a media interview to hold discussions with the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to see “if there is a point in continuing (the GSS), or whether there is a need to reformat it”. Last year’s GSS saw an uptick in retails sales, and the SRA declared it a “success”. The higher sales were partly attributed to the launch of the association's mobile shopping app GoSpree, and tourist spending, as the GSS coincided with holidays in Indonesia and China. But experts were quick to point out that the spike last year was partially due to the low base in 2016, and should not obscure the fact that the GSS badly needs a revamp. The duration of the GSS — which was increased several times over the years — has been \"dragged out” and its novelty has died, said Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior tourism lecturer Michael Chiam. And if the first two weeks of this year’s GSS is anything to go by, shoppers and retailers alike are feeling the same way.  “There is always a sales rack – the off-season rack, the clearance rack, the post-sale sale rack. I don’t have to wait till GSS to get something on sale,” said undergraduate Farhanah Hussein, 21. Since this year’s GSS started, avid shopper Margaret Soh, 55, has spent about S$2,500 on shopping, including close to S$2,000 on seven skirts at Takashimaya’s Pleats Please Issey Miyake outlet. However, this is about half of her usual spending during the GSS in previous years. The travel industry executive said she was unimpressed with the discounts dangled by retailers this time. Among other things, so-called bargains were items which had previously gone on sale and the discounts in general were not generous enough, she lamented. In recent years, GSS has become big on “gimmicks” that offer a discount only for the second item bought, for example, she noted. Retailer and Naiise founder Dennis Tay, 33, reminisced how his parents would go on an annual shopping spree – snapping up pots, pans, bedsheets and other things \"that we don’t change often\" – during the GSS when he was a child. Now, as the owner of several lifestyle stores in Orchard, Katong and Jurong, he is trying to do his bit to recreate the GSS magic – by offering “everything at S$20” flash sales and discounts of up to 15 per cent, on top of sale items that are cheaper by as much as 70 per cent. But response has been tepid, with sales inching up by a mere 3 to 5 per cent since this year’s GSS started. He noted how during the four-day Black Friday sales last November, his firm’s sales were at least three to four times higher than what it typically achieves during the two-month GSS. It was a similar story at homegrown menswear label Benjamin Barker. Its chief operating officer Damien Tan, 41, said the brand, which is offering a “buy three, get one free” bundle deal, did not see any significant spike in walk-ins. WHERE’S THE BUZZ? This year’s GSS runs from Jun 8 to Aug 12. At Ion Orchard for example, the distinctive red banners and posters screaming “sale” were plastered all over the mall. However, it was telling that several tenants including Charles & Keith and Sephora were not holding any sale when the mall was visited the Sunday before. “The tell-tale signs (that the GSS has lost its shine) were that there wasn’t much buzz about it in the media and some retailers didn’t even bother participating,” said Savills research and consultancy senior director Alan Cheong. Meanwhile, things were quiet the weekend before at Cineleisure and Far East Plaza which used to be filled with young crowds. Vacant shop spaces were also scattered throughout the shopping centres, exposing the deeper malaise plaguing Singapore retailers. On the first floor of Far East Plaza, some 50 shops had their shutters down, with fewer than 10 clothing outlets open for business. Mr Cheong noted that the fate of the GSS is linked to the fortunes of Orchard Road, which is the subject of a S$1.3 million study being conducted by Australian urban planning consultancy firm Cistri. Cistri recently won the tender awarded by STB and the Urban Redevelopment Authority to rejuvenate the 2.2km shopping belt. The six-month study began in April and a blueprint for the area — spanning the next 15 to 20 years — is expected to be unveiled later this year. In order to breathe new life into the retail scene, and save GSS in the process, Mr Cheong stressed the need for a fundamental overhaul. “Tweaking the retail mix or revamping the physical outlook of Orchard Road won’t help much and would probably result in negative returns on the new capital expenditures,” he said. News reports from local outlets had earlier highlighted how Orchard Road risked going out of fashion, given the combined onslaught of online shopping and the mushrooming of suburban malls in housing estates. As in previous years, there is little coordinated GSS marketing at suburban malls such as City Square Mall, Waterway Point and Nex. Any sales held in conjunction with the GSS were done out of the tenants’ own initiative. Several mall operators said they still see the GSS as one of the highlights in Singapore’s retail calendar, but they admitted that it does not rank high among their priorities when it comes to promotional efforts to increase footfalls. Nevertheless, AsiaMalls, which manages suburban malls including Tiong Bahru Plaza, White Sands, Hougang Mall and Century Square, said that many of its tenants have launched special sales and discounts to “excite shoppers” during this year’s GSS. An AsiaMalls spokesperson noted that industry players are operating in a different landscape with “technology (enabling) online shopping and changing buying patterns”. The spokesperson said:  With the constant stream of promotions happening all the time, shopping is now a year-long affair and consumers no long have to wait for GSS to enjoy shopping … (They) want greater convenience, more variety, and a differentiated experience when they shop. THE GSS STORY  The GSS is organised by the SRA and supported by the STB. The first GSS was held in 1994 for a month, with hopes that it would become “as popular in the region as the London and Paris sales are in Europe and the New York sales are in the United States”. It saw a record of 664,000 visitors, and the success prompted the organisers to decide to hold the event annually. “(The GSS) was started to enhance Singapore’s image as an attractive leisure destination and support visitor arrivals and spend,” said STB director of retail and dining Ranita Sundra in response to media queries. “Now in its 25th year, the GSS has developed into a key event on Singapore’s retail calendar that coincides with the peak travel season and national school holidays.” Barring years when Singapore was hit by economic recessions, the GSS generally lifted retail sales annually, and helped cement the Republic's reputation as a shopping paradise. But signs that the GSS was losing its lustre appeared in 2012 when the retail sales index for June fell sharply. It edged up the following year, but subsequently fell for the next three successive years. The declining trend was arrested last year when the retail sales excluding motor vehicles rose from June to August, compared with the same period in 2016. Over the years, SRA and STB had tried various ways to breathe new life into the GSS. SRA is the main promoter for GSS. On its part, the STB includes the event in its marketing plans, said Ms Sundra. Some of STB’s efforts in this area include GSS posts and content on STB’s various social media platforms and the VisitSingapore website. “These channels reach out to STB’s global audience and help to increase the awareness of GSS, participating retailers as well as deals and promotions,” said Ms Sundra. In 2016, China visitors in particular were targeted through various initiatives: The GSS period was extended from eight to 10 weeks – a third extension in GSS’ history – to better cater to tourists from Asia-Pacific countries, including China whose summer holidays fall in the June to August period. It was earlier extended from four to six weeks in 2000, and another two weeks were added to GSS in 2004. The organisers also moved on from partnering with MasterCard to Chinese payment company UnionPay. Last year, the GoSpree app was introduced, and downloaded more than 32,000 times during the GSS period. About 200 participating brands dangled exclusive offers and discounts through the app. To mark the GSS’ 25th anniversary this year, the SRA has introduced two days — Jul 7 and Aug 8 — on which the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be absorbed by participating retailers. Such a sales tactic has been successfully employed in the past by department store Robinsons. But this is the first time it has been introduced in the GSS. Other efforts this year include the addition of geofencing technology to the GoSpree app, which enables consumers to receive e-coupons for discounts if they are within a 5km radius of the participating merchants. From Jul 1, the app will also allow users to send the coupons to their friends by email or Facebook. An SRA spokesperson said more than 9,000 people have downloaded the GoSpree app this year, bringing the total user pool to around 43,000. Tourists make up one quarter of those who had downloaded the app. Courts Singapore is among the retailers which have come onboard the GoSpree app. Its country CEO Ben Tan said it is offering exclusive promotions via the app, with shoppers able to “enjoy attractive discounts of up to 40 per cent on small and personal care appliances as well as cookware by downloading eCoupons on the app and presenting them at the cashier counter for redemption”. However, some retailers including Benjamin Barker were uninterested. Mr Tan, its chief operating officer, felt the app’s reach was “still very limited”, and the additional point of sales — in return for what he felt were little returns — was cumbersome for a small outfit like theirs. FIXING THE GSS: WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE? Apart from piecemeal initiatives, some experts and retailers felt that a more fundamental review of the GSS concept was needed. Among other things, the organisers must be clear about the campaign’s target audience — whether it is tourists or domestic consumers — and whether it wants to reach out to the younger, more tech savvy generation of shoppers or is content with getting the business of an older demographic, they pointed out. The recent focus on Chinese tourists for example does not resonate with retailers serving the domestic market, the experts and retailers noted. The seemingly old-school marketing efforts are also having a limited reach, they added. “GSS was created 25 years ago. Up till today, we are still very unsure who the target demographic is,” said Benjamin Barker’s Mr Tan, who reiterated that his business focuses on the domestic market. Ms Jaren Ho, 34, the founder of apparel brand Yacht 21, said the GSS was not doing enough to attract the millennials via social media such as Instagram. “You look at the crowd going to Art Box. GSS or not, people still want to shop, come out and spend money, but the concept needs to change. Renaming the whole thing might help. Or use another approach,” said Ms Ho, who suggested taking a “more lifestyle approach”. Mr Joshua Koh, who is the chief executive officer of local furniture firm Commune, said that should the GSS embrace its tourism focus, it should be made more holistic by involving the entertainment, hotel and food and beverage establishments as well — and not just clothing, furniture or appliance retailers for example. NO LONGER ‘THE SALE WORTH WAITING FOR’ Ultimately, the GSS needs to stand out from the other sales campaigns all-year round, if it wants to remain relevant.  When it was first started, the GSS was “the only season” for great deals and discounts, said Benjamin Barker’s Mr Tan. Ms Ho added: “Singaporeans (grew up) knowing what is a GSS.” That was a time when there were hardly any online competitors, said Mr Bernard Aw, principal economist at market research firm IHS Markit. “With fierce competition from online retailers now, it’s harder for GSS to gain the prominence it once had,” said Mr Aw. Other countries have also caught on and are providing stiff competition: The Malaysia Mega Sale, the Hong Kong Shopping Festival and the Amazing Thailand Grand Sale are all held during a similar period as the GSS, said Ms Wendy Low, who is the head of retail at Knight Frank. With consumers spoilt for choice, retailers are also coming up with their own strategies, with many turning to the online space. Apart from holding their own sales outside of the GSS period, some major retailers — including Robinsons and Metro — are cashing in on global shopping events such as Black Friday or Singles Day.  As a result, consumers hoping for the best deals during GSS are left disappointed. “Given strong regional competition and the rise of online shopping, the GSS can certainly benefit from a reinvention,” said Courts Singapore’s Mr Tan. “That said, it remains a signature event for both locals and tourists, who tend to bargain-hunt during the season.” IF YOU CAN’T BEAT’EM, JOIN’EM To give the GSS a much-need publicity boost and renewed interest among today’s Internet-savvy customers, the organisers could also leverage the reach of online retailers, some experts suggested. Lazada, for instance, held its first GSS sale in 2015, and generated the most buzz on the Internet then with daily deals on its mobile app, according to marketing technology company Amobee. This year, Lazada continued to offer sales under the GSS banner, and contrary to reports from physical stores, the e-retailer has seen a sharp increase in sales compared to last year. “Shoppers this year are increasingly browsing and purchasing via Lazada’s app in comparison to previous GSS sale periods. This can be attributed to our new Shakin’ Deals feature, where shoppers can shake their Lazada app to win exclusive vouchers,” the e-retailer mentioned.  In 2015, e-shopping service provider ezbuy started its annual “65eday” campaign which is held every year on June 5. “We introduced this to commemorate Singapore as ezbuy’s country of origin and create Singapore’s first and largest global online shopping festival that customers can look forward to,” the firm said. The sale, which was held just three days before this year’s GSS official started, offered discounts of up to 90 per cent “across millions of products from various marketplaces”.  The company also held sales from Jun 10 to 18 — coinciding with the start of the GSS this year — as part of its annual mid-year sale, where sellers offer 20 per cent to 50 per cent discounts. Ezbuy’s largest sale, however, remains the Singles’ Day sales where it sees “50 to 100 times increase in sales”. Retailers are sitting up and taking notice.  Accordingly, they are adjusting their strategies. Courts Singapore’s Mr Tan said that in recent years, the company has “noticed the rise in popularity of other shopping events such as Black Friday and Singles Day that play on the rise of e-commerce”. As such, it has been “driving promotions during these signature shopping events over the years”, he said. Since Courts started participating in Black Friday sales from 2013, sales momentum has been growing year on year, he added. Associate Professor Prem Shamdasani, from the National University of Singapore Business School’s department of marketing, suggested that GSS can rethink its bricks-and-mortar proposition and encourage retailers to offer a “bricks and clicks” sales experience – integrating the offline and online experience to offer greater convenience, value, variety and services to shoppers. “(This) will attract more millennial and international shoppers and help drive shopper traffic to the stores and malls, which can further differentiate themselves by organising thematic promotional events,” said Assoc Prof Shamdasani. Experts reiterated that Singapore, which does not operate on a low-cost structure as in Thailand or Malaysia, should think about a unique proposition for its shopping festival that would work to its strengths. Dr Kapil Tuli, who heads Singapore Management University’s Retail Centre of Excellence, said: “As with any strategy, over the years competitors catch up and imitate. In that respect, any entity needs to ask itself: What is the unique value about our offering and do we have the assets to make this offering?”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/great-singapore-sale-premier-shopping-event-now-left-in-the-dust-10467138"}, {"datetime": "25 Jun 2018 10:50PM", "tags": ["death", "accident"], "author": "", "title": "Woman, 58, decapitated in Admiralty industrial accident", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 58-year-old woman was decapitated after an industrial accident on Monday (Jun 25) afternoon at 8A Admiralty Street.

The amount is \"a proportion of\" the current HDB season parking rate, MND said in responses to The Straits Times that were shared with Channel NewsAsia. For HDB residents' first parking lot, the monthly parking charge is S$80 for surface car parks and S$110 for sheltered car parks. \"The rate is a proportion of the prevailing HDB season parking rate since MPs do not park overnight or full day at their constituencies,\" the MND said, adding that the permit fee was increased from S$260 in 2016.  \"This rate is about a third of prevailing HDB season parking rates. We will continue to review and update the parking rate regularly to keep pace with prevailing HDB parking rates,\" MND said.  Non-constituency MPs and Nominated MPs are not given this permit, MND added. To facilitate grassroots volunteers in their community work, those who drive may apply for a monthly HDB special parking label which allows them to park, up to 11pm, in designated car parks within the constituency or GRC where they serve, the People's Association (PA) said in a separate response to media queries.  To qualify, they have to be appointed to serve in the citizens consultative committees, community centre/club management committees and their sub-committees, PA said. Those who live in an HDB estate must first buy a residential season parking label while non-HDB dwellers must pay S$22 a month for the special parking label. \"Our grassroots volunteers regularly help out in house visits, especially to the old and vulnerable who need assistance, as well as in organising community activities and dialogues to strengthen neighbourly ties,\" PA said.  Earlier in March, the Ministry of Education (MOE) confirmed that teachers would have to pay monthly season parking rates from Aug 1 this year. The move came after MOE reviewed its car park policy for schools after the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) flagged in 2015 that the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic did not impose charges or had charges that were below the market rate.  \"Such practices are tantamount to providing hidden subsidies for vehicle parking and are not in line with the requirements laid down in the Government Instruction Manuals,\" the AGO had said. The annual rate for parking in schools for an uncovered lot is S$720 while that for a sheltered lot is S$960. The Public Service Division has said that public officers are required to pay car park charges at their workplace in line with the clean wage policy. \"This is to ensure there are no hidden benefits,\" PSD said. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) imposed market rate season parking charges on six more MINDEF and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps and bases from Apr 1.  Channel NewsAsia understands that the charges are S$120 per month for covered car parks and S$90 per month for open-air car parks. This fee applies to all permanent staff members, as well as contractors who require a car park lot on a regular basis.  \"Operationally ready national servicemen who are going for their in-camp training and other operationally ready national service activities will continue not to be charged for parking their cars in all camp/bases,\" MINDEF said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/elected-mps-pay-365-annually-parking-hdb-car-parks-parliament-10468334"}, {"datetime": "25 Jun 2018 09:24PM", "tags": ["crime"], "author": "", "title": "Maid arrested after death of employer at Choa Chu Kang flat ", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 24-year-old maid was arrested on Monday (Jun 25) in relation to a murder case in Choa Chu Kang.

But for the past two weeks, their dishes have come with an extra serving of World Cup on the side as they catch games on their son Lester's handphone. \"My parents don't really watch football, but because of the World Cup, my mom and dad have become more interested,\" Mr Lester Thio, 24 told Channel NewsAsia. \"They also give their opinions on the game and that's pretty funny.\"  Football fever has gripped their household, and Mr Thio, a marketing intern, has caught every match of the tournament, which started on Jun 14. He has been sleeping three to four hours per night on average. \"The games are (at) 8pm, 10pm and 2am, so even if you want to sleep it's quite difficult,\" said Mr Thio. \"I just have a coffee at work which helps me stay awake (the next day).\" This year, games are being held at various venues in Russia, which are three to six hours behind Singapore. Mr Thio, who is rooting for Brazil this World Cup, watches pre-match shows and surfs the Internet in between matches. But he admits that fatigue does kick in towards the end of the week. \"I was actually quite tired last Friday as it was an accumulation of sleep debt over the whole week,\" added Mr Thio. \"I catch up on sleep during the weekends.\" Another World Cup fan, Mr Jagdish Singh, has watched all but three of the 32 opening games, despite having to be in the office at 9am in the morning. To stay healthy, he takes vitamin C tablets daily and makes sure to drink lots of water. \"So far, so good. I'm still able to survive the day,\" said Mr Jagdish. \"The weekdays are sometimes a bit tiring but I still can pull through. \"It's a must-watch competition, the best one in football, so I'd say it's worth sacrificing my sleep to watch all these games.\" Mr Jagdish makes sure to sleep in till noon on the weekends, to make up for the long nights earlier in the week. \"Even if I don't sleep, I make sure I don't do anything too strenuous,\" he added. Mr Koh Ming Swee has also watched at least 20 World Cup games so far. Mr Koh, a Chelsea supporter, said that the lack of sleep has \"not been an issue\". There's also a \"social aspect\" to the games, as friends who are not football fans will gather to watch games, he said. \"I'm used to late nights anyway, World Cup or not,\" said Mr Koh. \"Since the World Cup only comes once every four years, sacrificing some sleep is worth it.\" Doctors Channel NewsAsia spoke to said that they have not seen an increase in patients during the first two weeks of the tournament. This is partly because the period coincides with the school holidays when general practitioners usually do not see as many patients. But they warned against an accumulated lack of sleep. \"We need at least six to eight hours of 'battery charging',\" said Dr Gideon Ng, a general practitioner. \"If you don't charge your battery, it's just like your handphone - which will function sub-optimally. This weakens your immune system and you'll be susceptible to all kinds of infection, especially viral infections.\" \"You cannot be in (sleep) deficit for more than 24 hours. If you have a deficit from the day before, you should replenish it as soon as possible.\" But these World Cup fans are undeterred. \"It's only for a month or so. Either way, plan which matches are 'must-watches' in advance so you know when you can sleep more. Then get more rest on the weekends, and take care of your health in general outside of that,\" said Mr Koh, who works as a copywriter at a creative agency.  \"It's getting closer to the knockout stages, and every game has become a must-watch,\" added Mr Thio. \"I'm not going to miss out, unless there's some big catastrophe.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sleep-is-for-the-weekends-bleary-eyed-but-singapore-world-cup-10467518"}, {"datetime": "25 Jun 2018 07:40PM", "tags": ["oBike"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "LTA to engage oBike on exit plans amid concerns over idle bicycles on streets ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it will be engaging oBike on its exit plans amid concerns from commuters that thousands of bicycles will be left abandoned on the streets, after the company announced on Monday morning (Jun 25) that it has ceased operations in Singapore. Users of the bike-sharing app who tried to unlock bicycles on Monday were unable to, leaving thousands of oBikes left idle on pavements, parks and bus stops all over the country. In response to media queries from Channel NewsAsia, LTA said it “will be engaging oBike on their exit plans, including the removal of shared bicycles from public places”.  IT administrator Nicholas Lee, who travelled via oBike at least twice daily, told Channel NewsAsia that he tried to unlock three oBikes on his way to work on Monday morning, but got error messages informing him that the company had ceased operations in Singapore. “The bicycles were along the Siglap park connector, near a bus stop and opposite Kembangan MRT. Will these bicycles now be just left there? Who’s going to clear them away now that oBike could just pack up and go,” said the 29-year-old. Another commuter, Elliot Pang, who does not use bike-sharing apps, said that the idle oBikes could invite some “irresponsible people” to strip the bicycles for parts. “I’ve seen people removing the chains, the seats, the wheels from these bikes. Now that oBike is out of the picture, these people might take the opportunity to take the bicycles and take what they need – without consequences,” said the 48-year-old.   Transport analyst Prof Lee Der Horng told Channel NewsAsia that LTA will have to step in to ensure that oBike removes all its bicycles.  “We cannot tolerate the bicycles just being left there. Bike-sharing is a very cruel test of human tendencies - it exposes the dark side of people and let’s hope the authorities will intervene to improve the situation,” said Prof Lee, who works at the National University of Singapore.   Dr Walter Theseira, a transport economist at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, told Channel NewsAsia that there are “reasonable concerns” that any operator who exits may do so in a disorderly manner without clearing its bikes or refunding deposits. “It’s unclear whether oBike falls in this group and whether there are effective sanctions the authorities can use if they don’t fulfill their obligations,” he said. Channel NewsAsia has reached out to oBike to clarify its plans for collecting its bicycles. oBIKE USERS UNABLE TO RETRIEVE DEPOSITS Besides the issue of abandoned bicycles, many oBike users have also complained that they have been unable to retrieve the S$49 deposit they made to use the app. Transport planner Ryan Wong, who used oBike thrice a week, said the “refund deposit” feature on his app was not available when he tried to access it on Monday morning. “I contacted them and they said that the app will be updated soon. But no updates have been issued. And I still can't withdraw my deposit,” said the 30-year-old, who paid for three separate accounts with his credit card. “I am hopeful that oBike will sort this out. I’m not sure of what I can do. I hope the Government intervenes,” he added. Jeremy, another oBike user, told Channel NewsAsia that the oBike app does not detect internet connection. He said the app indicated that he paid a S$49 deposit, but the refund button was not there. “I have not received any news from oBike on how they will be refunding us. So I’ve made a police report,” said the IT engineer. In its statement to Channel NewsAsia, LTA said affected consumers should make a request for the refund of their deposits or subscription fees with oBike if they have not already done so. LTA added that users who are facing difficulties getting their refunds from oBike may wish to approach the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE). Channel NewsAsia has contacted CASE for comment, and also asked oBike about such problems. LTA has set a Jul 7 deadline for bike-sharing firms to submit applications for a licence to operate in public places or cease operations.  Those who submit them will have their applications evaluated and licence awarded by September.  Four other bike-sharing firms - Mobike, ofo, SG Bike and Anywheel - have indicated to Channel NewsAsia that they plan to meet the deadline. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lta-obike-exit-plans-idle-bikes-on-streets-10467448"}, {"datetime": "25 Jun 2018 07:07PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "Mahathir Mohamad"], "author": "", "title": "Malaysia, Singapore must 'comply fully' with Water Agreement provisions: MFA", "content": " SINGAPORE: Both Malaysia and Singapore must \"comply fully\" with the provisions of the 1962 Water Agreement and the 1965 Separation Agreement, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Monday (Jun 25).

Mr Puthucheary, speaking during a panel session on fake news, said from an engineering perspective, fake news is a “solvable problem” but acknowledged the difficulty in tackling it with legislation. He cited an example of a Facebook post showing a young man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and doing a Nazi salute at Hong Lim Park. It had upset a UK woman so much, due to its association with the Holocaust, she fought to have the picture removed from the social media platform.  It was later discovered the man made the salute to protest against what he perceived as the fascist People’s Action Party (PAP) Government, Mr Janil added. That said, any law enacted that may have compliance costs associated is not targeting just Facebook. “It will affect anyone that plays in this space,” he explained, even newcomers trying to enter. A Facebook representative on the panel, Mr Alvin Tan, had earlier pointed out that the issue of fake news and how to mitigate it is “multifaceted”, and legislation is an “imperfect tool” to deal with the issue. Mr Tan, head of Public Policy for ASEAN, Malaysia and Singapore at Facebook, said during the discussion it was difficult to enforce the laws in each country Facebook has a presence in. He cited an example raised by moderator Torben Stephan, director of Media Programme Asia at Konrad Adenauer Stiftung Singapore, which illustrates the difficulty. Mr Stephan had talked about how the denial of the Holocaust is considered a crime in Germany, yet he still sees such assertions made on Facebook, and wondered how the law can be enforced and who will prosecute the offenders. The social media giant had said during the public hearings on deliberate online falsehoods in March this year that it will remove content that is locally illegal if it receives a court order, but does not have a policy that requires all content posted to be “true, verified and accurate” so as not to be put in a position where it has to be the arbiter of the truth. Another panellist, Dr Cherian George, contended that big Internet giants like Facebook should not be allowed a free pass to not deal with the issue by saying every market and its laws are different and enforcement is difficult. Dr George, a professor at the Department of Journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University, pointed out the apparent unequal treatment of the issue by Facebook using Germany and Myanmar as examples. As Germany is a big market for the company, it has poured in resources like hiring more reviewers to comply with the country’s recent law aimed at hate speech and fake news. The same cannot be said of markets like Myanmar, which the academic said may be more in need of such resources given the rise in Internet use and disinformation spreading there. The social media platform’s role in spreading hate speech against Rohingya Muslims in the country was put under the spotlight earlier this year, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it was something the company is paying a lot of attention to. He also said it was hiring “dozens” more Burmese-language content reviewers to look for hate speech, among other initiatives to address this in a Washington Post report. Mr Tan said the company “needs to be smarter” about how it uses humans to complement machine learning algorithms to sift through things like hate speech on its platform. This was an issue Facebook highlighted when it released its community standards enforcement efforts for the first time in May this year. Mr Guy Rosen, the company’s vice president of Product Management, told Channel NewsAsia then it is “very hard” to build artificial intelligence to address hate speech. “We’re doing as much as we can ...

The technique has been used to create ice walls as part of works to construct a stretch of tunnels at Thomson-East Coast Line’s (TEL) Marina Bay station, LTA announced on Monday (Jun 25).   LTA said the ice walls were used to stabilise the ground and ensure that construction works will not impact operations on the Circle Line and North-South Line tunnels located above the TEL tunnels.  \"Over the years, LTA has tunnelled through many different kinds of ground conditions, but this is the first time that ground-freezing technology is used in an LTA construction project. The ground here consists of old alluvium clay which is hard to stabilise with cement grouting,\" said Mr Ng Kee Nam, group director for TEL and Cross Island Line (Civil).  \"Before the start of tunnelling works, we carried out multiple site checks and soil investigation works to decide on the best system to stabilise the ground. Ground-freezing method was found to be most suitable,” he added.   According to LTA, the technology was adopted for Marina Bay Station by installing a series of freeze pipes into the ground.  \"Chilled brine at a temperature of -30 degrees Celsius is circulated within the freeze pipes, to allow the surrounding soil to freeze and form individual ice columns,” LTA said. “The columns will then grow in size and join together with neighbouring columns to form one continuous, impermeable ice wall,” it added.  LTA said the ground-freezing process at the TEL Marina Bay Station started in March this year. After about two months, two ice walls about 1.8m in diameter were formed about 40m below ground. The ice walls will be in place for about three months until the construction of the TEL’s Woodlands-bound tunnel is completed, LTA said.  The freeze pipes will then be deactivated, allowing the ground to thaw before construction works for the Upper Changi-bound TEL tunnels above it commence.  The construction for the TEL Marina Bay Station and its tunnels are expected to be completed in 2021.  The 43km long TEL will add 31 new stations to the existing rail network, with seven interchange stations linking it to all five existing MRT lines.  It is targeted to be fully operational by 2024.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ice-walls-to-stabilise-construction-of-thomson-east-coast-line-10466778"}, {"datetime": "25 Jun 2018 01:16PM", "tags": ["CPI", "inflation"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore's inflation rate rose to 0.4% in May", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore's headline inflation rate rose to 0.4 per cent in May compared to the 0.1 per cent recorded in April, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Jun 25). The increase was largely due to a faster pace of price increases across all major categories. The cost of private road transport edged up by 0.1 per cent in May, reversing the 0.8 per cent decline in April.  This was due to a faster pace of increase in petrol prices, as well as a smaller year-ago fall in car prices following a rise in Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums.  Services inflation rose to 1.6 per cent in May from 1.3 per cent in April, due to stronger pickup in holiday expenses and airfares, as well as a smaller year-ago decline in telecommunications services fees.  The overall cost of retail items registered a larger 1.3 per cent increase in May compared to the 0.9 per cent rise in the previous month, while food inflation slowed to 1.3 per cent in May from 1.4 per cent in April.  The cost of accommodation fell by 3.2 per cent in May, easing from the 3.6 per cent decline in April. This reflected a larger year-ago increase in the cost of housing maintenance and repairs, as well as a slower pace of decline in housing rentals. Core inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, edged up to 1.5 per cent in May from 1.3 per cent in April, reflecting higher services and retail inflation. The two government agencies said core inflation is expected to rise gradually over the course of 2018 to average in the upper half of the 1 per cent to 2 per cent forecast range, should economic conditions evolve as expected.  Similarly, headline inflation is projected to come in at the upper half of the 0 per cent to 1 per cent forecast range for the full year. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-inflation-rate-rose-to-0-4-in-may-10466914"}, {"datetime": "25 Jun 2018 12:30PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Mahathir Mohamad"], "author": "Sumisha Naidu", "title": "Exclusive: Price of water sold to Singapore 'ridiculous'; Malaysia to renegotiate deal, says Mahathir", "content": " PUTRAJAYA: The price of water being sold to Singapore is \"ridiculous\", and Malaysia will make a presentation to its neighbour on renegotiating the terms of the water supply deal, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday (Jun 25). \"I think it is manifestly ridiculous that we should sell water at 3 sen per thousand gallons. That was okay way back in the 1990s or 1930s. But now what can you buy with 3 sen? Nothing,\" the 92-year-old told Channel NewsAsia in an exclusive interview. Earlier, Bloomberg had reported that Dr Mahathir intended to go back to the drawing board on the water accord, which is set to expire in 2061. \"We are studying the case properly and we’ll make a presentation,\" he told Channel NewsAsia. The revival of the water issue comes on the back of Dr Mahathir's decision to scrap the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail project agreed upon by the previous Najib Razak administration. Dr Mahathir had cited a need to reduce the country's debt and liabilities exceeding RM1 trillion (US$251 billion) as the reason for scrapping the deal. Singapore has, however, stated that it has not been informed of Malaysia's intent. At the interview, Dr Mahathir was asked about his foreign policy decisions, and he conceded that Malaysia had yet to inform Singapore about its intentions on both issues. \"Sometimes we make public statements without actually finalising the process,\" he said. \"When we want to make a decision we don't wait until we inform Singapore, we just say something. Of course they would want to know, and we will inform them in time.\" Asked if there is any timeframe on when he's planning to inform Singapore, he said: \"It's not so urgent.\" Dr Mahathir repeated this during a press conference on Monday evening, when he was asked again if he would be speaking to Singapore on renegotiating the water deal. \"It's not urgent,\" he reiterated. \"We have many other problems that we have to focus on\". At the same conference, he also confirmed that the water issue had not been discussed in Cabinet before he made his comments, but that he was \"pressed to announce\" the issue after being \"asked by the press\". Earlier, Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister said any bilateral problems that may arise from these choices could be resolved.    \"I think whether we like it or not, Singapore is our closest neighbour and we have a common history. Whether we like it or not, we have to live with each other,\" he said. \"There will be little problems, conflicts and all that, (but) we'll resolve them.\" WATER AGREEMENT \"SACROSANCT\" TO SINGAPORE In a response to Dr Mahathir's comments later on Monday, the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said both Malaysia and Singapore must \"comply fully\" with the provisions of the 1962 Water Agreement and the 1965 Separation Agreement.  \"The 1962 Water Agreement is a fundamental agreement that was guaranteed by both governments in the 1965 Separation Agreement which was registered with the UN,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.  Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysia's former prime minister Najib Razak in January had reaffirmed the importance of undertaking measures to ensure the reliable and adequate water supply from the Johore River as provided for in the 1962 Water Agreement. In a joint statement issued after a Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat, both countries also affirmed the terms of the agreement, under which Singapore is given full and exclusive rights to draw up to a maximum of 250 million gallons (mgd) of water per day from the Johore River. In return, Johor is entitled to buy treated water of the same volume as up to 2 per cent of the water extracted by Singapore on any given day, or about 5 mgd if Singapore draws its full entitlement of water from the Johor River. In February this year, then-Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Chan Chun Sing said Singapore must ensure that it has an adequate supply of water by the 2050s, before the water agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061. Under national water agency PUB’s masterplan, NEWater and desalination will meet 85 per cent of Singapore’s water demand by 2060. That is also when the total water demand is expected to double. In a written Parliamentary reply to Member of Parliament for Marine Parade GRC Seah Kian Peng in January 2017, Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan said the 1962 Water Agreement was \"sacrosanct\" to Singapore. \"It was guaranteed by both the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore under the 1965 Separation Agreement, which was deposited with the United Nations,\" he said. In March 2017, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said Singapore must be psychologically prepared to face water shortages if its reservoirs dry up and when the second water agreement with Malaysia ends in 2061. At present, imported water meets half of Singapore’s water needs. But water levels in Johor’s Linggiu Reservoir are falling. There is also the danger of prolonged dry weather, Mr Teo said at the time. To watch the full interview, tune in to Conversation With on Thursday (Jun 28) at 9.30pm (SIN/HK).

It is meant for residents who exercise or walk their dogs. But parking here saves me time,” said the 23-year-old, wiping beads of perspiration off his forehead. However, Mr Phua is aware that his days of parking these bicycles at non-designated areas are numbered because of a new licensing framework which will soon kick in.  The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has set a Jul 7 deadline for bike-sharing firms to submit applications for a licence to operate in public places or cease operations.  Those who submit them will have their applications evaluated and licence awarded by September.

Two of these operators - ofo and SG Bike - confirmed that users of their shared bikes will incur extra costs if they park indiscriminately.ofo said users who “end their trips in areas deemed to be indiscriminate” will incur “financial penalties”.“We are working with LTA to ensure this government mandated fine is implemented in a sensible fashion that takes into account the needs of bike share users and does not deter users from using this efficient environmentally friendly affordable transport option,” said the company, which has a current fleet size of 70,000.SG Bike, told Channel NewsAsia that “it needs” to charge users an additional rental fee for each instance of indiscriminate parking.However, the firm added that users who commit the offence will be given a “grace period” to unlock their bicycles and park it within the designated areas.   Mr Phua, who uses the ofo service four times daily, admitted that he will probably have to change his parking habits once the fines kick in. “We are not sure how much the fines will be, but I don’t think I’m prepared to risk finding out. It’s tempting to park at places conveniently but it’s something I’ll have to take note of in the near future,” he said.SCANNING QR CODES TO END TRIPBesides imposing fines, bike-sharing firms also plan to fulfil LTA’s requirements on QR code-based geo-fencing, where users will have to scan a QR code at designated parking spaces as proof of proper parking before they can end their trip.ofo said it has “already begun work to implement an additional step to allow users to scan a QR code at the end of the trip”. “Used as a tool to influence user behaviour, and the use of public spaces, QR codes can be a part of the solution,” said ofo. Lydia Sim, who uses Mobike and ofo bicycles, told Channel NewsAsia that scanning the QR code adds \"a bit\" of inconvenience to her trip. “Sometimes the apps don’t pick up the QR code, and I could be spending a lot of time trying to key in the bike serial number and so on. I hope they’ll implement a system that will function well, I don’t want to be fined even though I parked at the right place,” said the 32-year-old teacher.

Although the firm confirmed that it is in the process of applying for the licence, and is “firming up some details”, it also said that it has to review and take into serious consideration all operational and financial decisions to ensure a sustainable and successful business model.   “Our goal is to assess and evaluate the financial and operational construct of the business and make an optimal decision to provide an efficient and effective bike sharing service after the implementation of the licensing scheme,” the firm said.

Mr Thomas Chua had previously indicated he will step down. Meanwhile, unionist K Thanaletchimi said in an email to Channel NewsAsia that she understands the labour movement is currently reviewing its NMP nomination and believes it will be making an announcement soon.

Ms Felicia Low, who is a lecturer at School of the Arts’ (SOTA) Humanities and Social Sciences department and founding director of not-for-profit organisation Community Cultural Development (Singapore), was one who put her name up for consideration. She had previously received the Outstanding Youth In Education Award 2005 and was selected for the President’s Young Talent Show 2009, according to her biography on SOTA’s website. The other candidate was Mr Woon Tien Wei, a visual artist who founded Post-Museum. The social enterprise describes itself as “an independent cultural and social space in Singapore which aims to encourage and support a thinking and pro-active community” on its website. Ms Low said in her introduction during the town hall meeting that one of the driving forces behind her decision to stand for nomination is a desire to make sure the arts students she is currently teaching are able to make a living from their craft. She spoke about the need to professionalise the creative field and broaden the scope of what arts meant for the wider Singapore society and defining their value, so that artists would be able to have a sustainable livelihood. Mr Woon, meanwhile, described himself as a “busybody” and empathetic of many communities. This can be seen by his advocacy work in heritage and conservation issues such as the Bukit Brown cemetery and Sungei Road flea market. During the town hall session, outgoing NMP Kok took the opportunity to share about his experiences in Parliament. He said one of the challenges he faced was getting the legislative and administrative support he needed to better debate the bills proposed. He also said many parliamentary processes, such as one where NMPs can put forward petitions, are “still not fully utilised”. He encouraged the next NMP who will represent the arts community to take every opportunity to speak up on various issues, as well as find out from parliamentary clerks the dos and don’ts of what they intend to pursue. “We are really at the infancy stage,” Mr Kok said. “I encourage everyone, not just the NMP, to up themselves in terms of the understanding of parliamentary processes.” As for the business and industry functional group, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) told Channel NewsAsia said they can submit up to two names for consideration. \"SBF is currently in the process of considering candidates for the business and industry group.

The birds were spotted at Pulau Ubin’s Chek Jawa wetlands last September when they flew in to feed after the tide receded. While Chek Jawa is no stranger to migratory shorebirds, NParks said that bird monitoring data collected in the past year has shown that certain species of migratory birds prefer the wetlands at Ubin over Sungei Buloh - Singapore’s other wetlands on the mainland.  “These are significant observations as they suggest that Pulau Ubin complements Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve as another possible stopover for migratory birds along the East Asian - Australasian Flyway,” NParks said.  The flyway - among the world’s most important - stretches from the arctic parts of Siberia to as far south as New Zealand.  The other species recorded include insectivorous bats like the Long-winged Tomb Bat and the Big-eared Pipistrelle, which have previously been found in Southeast Asia.  The Arrow Emperor dragonfly, which was discovered only recently in Malaysia and India, along with the Raccoon Pseudo-orb Weaver spider, were also newly added to the Singapore records.  Ubin Day is part of Pesta Ubin, an annual month-long festival to celebrate the islands rustic charm, heritage and natural environment.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/5-new-species-of-fauna-recorded-at-pulau-ubin-10464240"}, {"datetime": "24 Jun 2018 02:13PM", "tags": ["Sembcorp", "solar power", "Choa Chu Kang", "Housing and Development Board"], "author": "", "title": "Sembcorp wins mega tender to build solar panels on 848 HDB blocks, 27 government sites", "content": " SINGAPORE: Sembcorp Industries (Sembcorp) announced on Sunday (Jun 24) that its wholly owned subsidiary, Sembcorp Solar Singapore, has won the project to build, own, operate and maintain rooftop solar systems across 848 apartment blocks and 27 government sites.  The project, which involves a total capacity of 50 megawatts and covers blocks in the West Coast and Choa Chu Kang town councils, was awarded by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), according to a press release.  The government sites include CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School (Primary and Secondary), Dunman Secondary School, CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh), CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh), Choa Chu Kang Columbarium and Changi Prison Complex.

He joined politics in 2006 as a People’s Action Party candidate and his placid, good-natured demeanour could lead one to think that he routinely toes the party line. However, upon closer scrutiny, one would realise that he has no qualms about speaking up against policies and urging the Government to effect more meaningful change. More recently, Mr Seah’s speech in Parliament last month asking the Government to consider factors beyond economics when designing policy certainly caught the attention of many Singaporeans. While acknowledging that the economic reasoning that the Government has applied to public policies has “stood us in good stead”, he emphasised the need “to make more room for the lexicon of morality, duty, relationships and trust”. As an example to illustrate his point, he cited a controversial decision by the Ministry of Education to ensure that teachers pay for parking at school premises. Teachers, he pointed out, pay for Children’s Day treats, and surprises for children, “all these things which cost them no small amount of money and yet whose value transcends price”, so why should the authorities be calculative when it comes to the parking issue. As he sits before me, he emphasises that he is against thinking about any policy, not just this one, through purely an “economic lens”. But when I ask him which other policies he thinks need to be looked at differently today and going forward, he seems to be at a loss. “I must admit that right now, I can’t think of any immediately.” But his track record proves his sentiment is genuine to some extent. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To listen to the full interview, click here. “WHY ARE WE DOING ALL THESE THINGS? WHO ARE WE DOING IT FOR?” For instance, he spent years fighting for paternity leave so that fathers could be more involved in parenting, even if it involved the Government having to fund such leave. “I became an MP in 2006. At that point there was no paternity leave at all. I remember raising it in six Committee of Supply debates. This was under the purview of the Ministry of Manpower. Each time, they said they were not ready yet and they needed to balance it out with employers’ concerns.” Eventually, his call was heeded and paternity leave was gradually introduced. Today, fathers are granted two weeks of paid paternity leave funded by the Government. In addition, working fathers can share up to four weeks of their wives’ 16 weeks of government-paid maternity leave.  \"I think fathers have an important role to play and if it means we must spend money to help them play a more active role, we should.\" On this issue, he acknowledges there are still problems as studies show that in spite of being entitled to such leave, fathers are wary of taking time off due to anxiety that their employers will not take kindly to them being absent from work. “I guess the practical day-to-day challenges overwhelm most of us. So, the need for all of us to step back and ask ourselves, why are we doing all these things? Who are we doing it for?” On this, he feels the Government, being the largest employer in Singapore, can \"take a greater lead and set an example for other companies\". He reiterates that even what Singapore has today took many years to achieve. I ask if he ever feels frustrated when the Government is slow to act. “Many big things start small and if one has strong convictions, we should not let up.  I certainly believe there are enough MPs with differing viewpoints and who are prepared to give their ideas and suggestions to ministers for their consideration.  “At the same time, I must admit it is also easier to be an MP and make speeches than to be a minister and actually make real changes and to face the consequences for good or for bad. But I have the resolve and attitude of wanting to try and not to live a life of regrets.” Over the years, he has also spoken up for more assistance for unmarried single mothers. In 2016, the Ministry for Social and Family Development finally announced that the Government is ready to extend the full 16-week maternity leave accorded to married mothers, to single mothers as well. Their children also now have access to a Child Development Account, a savings scheme to help pay for childcare and healthcare costs. MPs and women’s rights groups spent years campaigning for this and other benefits. Mr Seah feels even more can be done to address their needs.  Unmarried mothers still do not get the Baby Bonus cash gift and parenthood tax rebates that even widows and divorcees, receive. When it comes to housing, they have to wait until they turn 35 to buy an HDB flat under the singles scheme. “The challenges of raising children by themselves is already hard enough. But they have to still think about something as basic as housing. So on our part as a Government, how can we help?” The Government has traditionally been cautious about equalising benefits for this group as it says doing so could send out the wrong signals.  A common argument is that such a move might be seen as condoning having children out of wedlock. “Frankly, I don’t believe in this. But even if as a result, one or two people start thinking along those lines, so be it. We shouldn’t stop ourselves from helping people just because we fear a small group could end up abusing a policy.” This concept should apply to every policy, he says, including to how much help should be given to the low-income in society and how even means-testing to assess a person’s eligibility for assistance is conducted. I put it to him that some have described means-testing as being overly intrusive, to the point that it discourages even the genuinely needy from seeking help. Then there are others who claim that it is not granular enough. “I have people telling me that just because a person lives in a three-room flat, it doesn’t mean they are poor. They can actually be very wealthy and we should scrutinise more to make sure we don’t give them rebates. It is always difficult in policy-making and it’s about striking the right balance. You also do not want to spend an inordinate amount of resources or time to administer some of these schemes. Of course, we need to make exceptions when the general proxies like housing and income are proven to be inaccurate in particular cases.” He urges social service agencies to take a more “human” approach to those who are truly in need.  “We should not formulate policies just to make sure that one person doesn't break the system. You end up inconveniencing the 99.9 per cent of us who are not intending to break it.  Put yourself in the beneficiary or the applicants’ shoes. For many, it’s not easy to ask for help.” HIGHER TAXES ON THE RICH As we continue talking, he acknowledges that while he wants even greater social spending on various groups in Singapore in order to narrow inequality and increase social mobility, it’s going to cost. The economic aspect cannot be divorced from the equation entirely. “We need to look out for the lower-income group to the extent of being deliberate in giving more help. I’m all for more progressive taxes on the top income earners. Those who have made it really ought to find ways to help others because they start life and their children start life already disadvantaged. We need to help them move up in terms of social mobility. We shouldn’t be shy about it,” he says. For example, over the years, he has suggested the Government reconsider how scholarships are awarded. The rich should get “nominal” ones which recognise their results but come with no money. The money should be awarded instead to other deserving students from less privileged backgrounds. He has also suggested households that own more than one car pay markedly higher additional taxes on their second and subsequent vehicles. However, when I ask whether he thinks capital gains and wealth taxes should be introduced, he hesitates. “The rich can afford to pay higher taxes but also, you cannot make the poor, rich by making the rich, poor. So I’m not sure about that. But I believe that in terms of luxury taxes and even income tax, more can be done.” He thinks we should “get away from overly comparing ourselves with Hong Kong” where the tax rates are generally lower. “Once we are fixated with that, it means the ability for us to adjust some of the taxes is very limited. We need to be competitive and we should.  But as with all things, we need to look at issues holistically. There are many factors that investors would take into account - tax rates are just one such factor. But on many other factors - environmental, social, security, infrastructure, many of my friends tell me Singapore compares very favourably against Hong Kong.\" When it comes to specifics though, I'm sceptical about how bold he really is, so I ask him which countries Singapore should compare itself against instead and how much he thinks income tax on the highest income earners should increase by. On this, he is non-committal. “The Minister for Finance will be better-placed to pin the right numbers. The key is that for corporate tax, I think there is room for it to be adjusted upwards and the same for personal income tax for the top earners. “I do pay quite a lot of taxes myself but I think it’s something we must be willing to do. When you have more, you should give more.” Over the years, among other things, he has urged the Government to review the quantum of Public Assistance to the needy more regularly in order to keep pace with the cost of living. But he clearly has an idea of what would be considered going overboard when it comes to taxes and social spending. “I was on a business trip in Copenhagen in Denmark. So I was talking to my Danish friend. He told me the income tax goes up to almost 60 per cent and their equivalent of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was 25 per cent. He said it’s okay because at the same time they have universal education and healthcare, but the difference between employment benefits and minimum wage is not very wide, so in his opinion, the incentive to work wasn’t quite there.” I remark that at this point, he seems to be echoing the Government's narrative on this issue even though more liberal analysts have said Scandinavian countries such as Denmark could be a model for Singapore.  \"It's about balance,\" he says with a laugh. GST HIKE MAY STILL BE NECESSARY While he feels the rich can afford to be taxed more, I wonder what his stance is on the impending GST hike announced in this year’s Budget. It is set to increase from 7 per cent to 9 per cent sometime between 2021 and 2025. Would this be necessary if corporate taxes and income taxes on top earners were to be increased? “Even if taxes on the top earners go up, we must remember that the demands on social spending are also going to go up quite a lot. Nobody likes a tax increase, but we have to be objective. We will be investing much more going forward - in our nursing homes, hospitals, roads and education. So a GST hike might be needed, but the Finance Minister has given a range. So if things work out, we may not have to increase GST so soon.” While he acknowledges several times during our interview that he falls in the category of a high-income earner and therefore would be taxed more if his ideas materialise, he also reminds me that part of the reason he is able to empathise with the lower income is because of his own circumstances as he was growing up. “I won’t say I’m a socialist but I’m a bit more, left-of-centre.” A HARD CHILDHOOD It's partly because he still remembers what living through financial hardship was like. He often had to make hard choices, he says. On certain days, it meant choosing between a bus ride or having a meal. His father was a line worker in a printing firm and his mother, a housewife who took on sewing gigs to make ends meet. He went to a neighbourhood primary school along with his three siblings. Thereafter, they all made it to top schools such as Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls’ School. A Colombo Plan scholarship allowed him to study at the University of New South Wales in Australia. While there, he learnt an important life lesson.  \"In Australia, every profession is respected. You could be a bricklayer and do it well and proudly and you can make a living. Whichever profession they were in, they felt dignified.\" Singapore has some way to go in that regard, he says.  He welcomes the Progressive Wage Model to elevate the status of low-income workers, but says that each of us needs to do more to instil a sense of respect for the work they do.  \"In a country like Australia, almost every student will do part-time work of some sort during school holidays. They could be working in a supermarket, in a restaurant. They might also do part-time work during the school year. And this is regardless of their socio-economic background. This builds a certain sense of resilience, it builds a certain sense of appreciation. Whereas in Singapore, well-off parents will tell their children to spend their  time studying or doing something else.\" He too, took on odd jobs including as a painter and kitchen helper during university vacations.  Mr Seah credits his success throughout school to the people around him.  “We received help from different groups of people. Our relatives chipped in to help us get by. I was also appreciative of the clan associations that gave us a few bursary awards. What stayed with me was the fact that whenever we are in the position to help others, we should. We were fortunate to grow up in a time when social inequality was less stark and the rate of social mobility was higher because economic growth was swifter. Things are different now. Aside from taxes, we should also make charitable contributions when we can.  “Suffice to say it is a significant portion of my MP allowance and salary that I give. We all contribute in different ways - time and money and for those who are in a position to do both, it is a real privilege and blessing.”  USING SINGAPORE’S RESERVES I raise another issue that he has alluded to in the past – that the Government is sometimes too far-sighted in policy planning and does not do enough in terms of taking care of short-term problems affecting citizens. To tackle these, he has suggested being open to dipping into our national reserves, but “for the right reasons”. “We are worried about whether Singapore survives 10 years from now, 20 years from now. Those are important things because we always want to make sure that the next generation inherits a functioning ship, not a broken ship. I think those are the good things but it’s about striking a balance. Let’s also not lose sight of the importance and the need to address short-term issues.” But what does he consider “the right reasons” to dip into the reserves? He cites how the Government invested S$1.1 billion in the Bus Service Enhancement Programme in 2012 to ease crowding on buses. “That’s one short-term issue that can be considered a “right reason”. We don’t always only have to talk about our 10-year plan to beef up the MRT network and such things.” However, what would qualify as \"the right reason\" in today's context? He isn't able to narrow it down to anything specific.  “I think the economic clouds, the uncertainties and a lot of restructuring is taking place, creating a lot of anxiety amongst particularly the PMETs and the older groups of Singaporeans - the fear of being displaced, the fear of not being able to find a job after they’re laid off or just going through the future jobs. Are they able to hack it? I think these are the things which we need to certainly keep an eye out for.” However, he acknowledges that through programmes such as SkillsFuture, the Government is doing something on that front and that at this point, there is no pressing need to use the country’s reserves. “No one is able to predict with certainty what’s going to come, but I think the preparedness to act decisively is important. If it means having to go into the reserves, I think we must. There’s no sacred cow. It must be an option that’s on the table.” NOT SHYING AWAY FROM CHALLENGES Even though he fervently believes in continuing to make a difference in the policy landscape, when asked about the highlights of his political career so far, he goes all the way back to 2010 when he was challenged by then Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan to come up with amendments to the Maintenance of Parents Act. Mr Seah had highlighted a sharp increase in the number of parents filing applications with the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents and had suggested that the Commissioner of the tribunal be given more powers to obtain data on the whereabouts and financial status of children who were not supporting their parents. “I’m not the type to shy away from a challenge, so when the minister asked me to work on it, I accepted it.” He was a first-term MP at the time and made legislative history as the first PAP MP to propose a Bill in 36 years.  To help him with the process, he assembled a workgroup comprising three Nominated Members of Parliament and seven MPs.   Ultimately, the amendments to the Act included compulsory mediation for parents who want to claim financial support from their children before they can go to the tribunal. Also, the tribunal's commissioner now has access to government databases, like CPF and tax records, to help track down children and assess their ability to support their parents. I remark this sounds intrusive and ask why he feels so strongly about legislating filial piety. “All things said and done, they are your parents, so I think no matter what the parents have done to the children, they are still your parents.” What about in cases where children don’t want to contribute to parents whom they deemed have failed them or abused them? “That’s a real concern which was why in the end, we said we need to try reconciliation first, hence mediation. If there are cases where reconciliation cannot happen, then we take those reasons into account and we don’t force it. “There are also cases where the children are really unable to support financially and we don’t force that either. But I feel we have to try.” WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY DO WE WANT? I ask him if this is merely designed to ensure that the state doesn’t have to provide support for needy elderly. “For me, it’s just about deciding what kind of society we want. Filial piety is important. Neither do we want a situation where people easily pass the buck to the state. But if you really can’t, the state will still step in.” Indeed when it comes to family-related issues, he has made several headlines. In 2013, then National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan called him the \"father\" of the Parenthood Priority Scheme which gives housing priority to young couples with children. Mr Seah had suggested it three years before that. His own relationship with his family is dear to him. His father passed away last year at the age of 88. Towards the end of his life, Mr Seah would help him shave and cut his toe nails.   He is quick to point out that his brother, two sisters and wife were very involved in looking after his dad too. Today, his mother has dementia. “That presents another set of issues but again, I’m fortunate that I have my siblings, my wife, helping out in caregiving.” This is partly why he feels more needs to be done to help caregivers especially in terms of affordable professional nursing and care services and caregiver leave. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN BUSINESS Aside from policy issues, I realise we need to talk about business as, in addition to his role as MP, Mr Seah is Group CEO of NTUC FairPrice, the supermarket chain first set up by the National Trades Union Congress in 1973 to moderate the cost of living. He admits that while it has a focus on social responsibility, it also has to keep an eye on profits. “It’s a very difficult thing to do, to balance the two. It is not binary or mutually exclusive. For us, doing well allows us to do more good for the community.” FairPrice has become a “multi-format” chain. For instance, in addition to FairPrice supermarkets for the masses, there are also FairPrice Finest stores catering to customers who can afford more upscale groceries. I wonder what he would say to customers who feel FairPrice products can afford to be cheaper. “We try and we want to do more. Our scorecard is a balanced one. It requires us to do well on our social mission, but also on our financials so that we can continue to fulfill our social mission. We are here to stay and help our customers through difficult times as well. For example, when GST was first introduced, we absorbed it for a period of time.” In recent years, he admits that competition is stiff especially with e-commerce retailers entering the market. “Frankly, it’s all evolving at a much faster pace than I thought. We are the incumbent and it is the curse of many incumbent leaders that it is much easier to become complacent. Today, we are going bigger on data analytics and this is allowing us to be able to serve our customers better. If I could unwind the clock, I would have done all this a lot earlier and invested even more. But it’s not too late.” Ultimately, he wants to be remembered for making a mark in both the business and political spheres as “someone who helped”. “I want to be remembered for having done good for the organisation and to let people see that the team puts in effort for society at large.

That's how he figured out how unusual his family was – in the entire class, his was the biggest by far. The middle child of seven children, and the only boy, he said: “I have more sisters than friends. (My classmates) say it’s very unfair because I have more siblings than them.” Certainly, there's never a dull moment in the Heng household, where simply keeping track of everyone is a miniature feat. To the extent that the family almost left home once without Raphael, when they were setting off for an outing to the swimming pool. Harder to manage than the logistics of going out, however, are the family’s expenses. So when Raphael wants his favourite snack at the supermarket, mum Esther Heng, 40, often has to tell him to wait until another time. “Which one is more worth it?” she asked him, pointing to his snack and a loaf of sliced bread that would feed everyone in the family for the same price of S$2. Despite the trend here towards having fewer children (or none at all), a few families like the Hengs have gone against the grain. The programme On The Red Dot spent months filming three families with large (by today's standards) broods, to see what it takes to raise a big family in Singapore today. (Watch the series here.) GETTING BY WITH HELP In the case of the Hengs, it was dad David who did not want to stop at two, which was his wife’s “initial plan”. Now they have seven between the ages of three and 16. It comes as no surprise when Mr Heng says he loves children. “Many couples would rather not have children, or they have a maximum of two,” said the 42-year-old. \"I see children not as a burden but as an inheritance – as a blessing.” He comes from a small family himself, with just two siblings. His wife has a younger sister only, which is why she did not expect to have so many children. A secondary school teacher for a decade, she quit after her fifth child, Arielle, was born in 2011. Raising their children on just one breadwinner's salary, however, has not been easy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Their monthly expenses amount to about S$3,000, which means there is nothing left to set aside as savings from Mr Heng's income as a social service worker. His parents help out, and the family receives assistance from the Social Service Office with things like the conservancy charges for their five-room Housing and Development Board flat. Their children are under the Education Ministry’s Financial Assistance Scheme, and the family can tap the Community Health Assist Scheme for their medical bills. Sometimes, Mr Heng also gets a “love offering” from his church friends. “They’d drop by and bless us with groceries or even bless the children with tickets to Universal Studios,” he said. His church has gifted them with staycations and trips to Malaysia. And “that’s how we’ve been living our lives for the last 11 years”, he said, since he left the army to work in social service. To save costs, the younger children must share their toys. And grocery trips are fraught with dilemmas. “When I buy things from the supermarket, I always have to check the prices,” said Mrs Heng, who looks for offers such as double-purchase discounts. “Because we’re such a big family, we’ve been living minimally … We don’t get to eat out in restaurants that often. We sometimes do eat out, but it’s just at food courts and the coffee shop.” AN OVERWORKED MUM Since March, however, Mrs Heng has been increasingly concerned about the stability of their family income, after her husband abruptly quit his job at a children’s home. Having coached at-risk youth, Mr Heng decided to start his own company conducting enrichment workshops for such youth and their guardians. While waiting for his enterprise to take off, he has been working part-time on projects for children with special needs, and freelancing for another company to bring children to heritage sites. His current earnings fall short by about S$500 a month. Despite this financial uncertainty, he felt it was the right move to shift gears. In the last two years especially, because of shift work that included nights and weekends, he'd not been spending enough time with his family. I was doing so much for these other children (at work), but my own children didn’t even see me at home. I was an absent daddy. “That, I think, in a way has caused some strains in the family,\" he said. Mrs Heng's entire day revolves around her supersized family. “I cook, I wash, I fold the laundry,” she said, her most precious ally the washing machine. “I can do without the TV, but … if the washing machine breaks down, that would mean I have to hand-wash five to six people’s clothes every day. It’s no joke.” She had a domestic helper once, but the family could ill-afford one after she became a stay-at-home mum. And Mrs Heng feels she has even less personal time now, than when she was working as a teacher. “When I’m overwhelmed with their schoolwork deadlines and then a lot of housework, or if one of them is ill, and I’ve to handle so many things … I do think about whether I’m raising them all by myself,” she said. There are times I just want to have a meal by myself, without the children calling me every 30 seconds: ‘Mummy, I need a bowl; Mummy, I need this; Mummy, my drink spilled; I need chopsticks.’ She also wakes the children up, prepares their breakfast, walks them to school and tutors them. Her day starts at 6am and ends at 11pm. Though her youngest, Isabella, stays with her in-laws on weekdays, Mrs Heng is still too swamped to cook on most days, so the family uses a tingkat meal delivery service. WATCH: Life in the Heng household (4:58)  Seeing his wife take on “so many extra duties” has made Mr Heng feel guilty. “As a husband and a father, I don’t feel good,” he admitted. Before he quit, his job had usually left him worn out when he was at home. “I’d be (lying) on the sofa and taking a nap,” he said. And so, the children often went to their mother to see to their needs, leaving Mr Heng – the disciplinarian in the family – feeling “jealous” and like a “lousy daddy”. SIBLING DYNAMICS He especially feels a “painful” disconnect with his oldest daughter, Samantha, who agrees that the two of them have “drifted apart”. “After Hannah was born (in 2013 – the sixth child), he had to work harder. He wasn’t at home as much,” said the 16-year-old, who cried a little as she remembered those times she missed her dad while growing up. While she spends more time with friends than family now, she remembers how it was when she was six and had only one sibling. “It was only Rachael and me, and Rachael was a small baby,” she said. I miss it because, for example, it was 100 per cent about me. Now it’s 100 divided into seven portions. Rachael, meanwhile, has different bothers of her own. While the 11-year-old, like her elder sister, says she dislikes having so many siblings “because they’re annoying”, she is also the most responsible among them. She is always being asked to “help them do stuff” every day, and is the sibling the younger ones listen to – the family's “little mother”, as she has been nicknamed by her mum. Said Mrs Heng: “Whenever there’s a conflict, I think Rachael would be the peacemaker … She’d try and find out what happened and who’s supposed to give way.\" Like the time Elisa, 10, kicked seven-year-old Arielle’s hand, and they were arguing whether it was an accident or not. While that makes it hard for Rachael to read her books or do her homework uninterrupted, her mother has had to rely on her to help ease such tensions, given that there are seven children requiring attention. “I tend to call on her most of the time because she’s obliging,” said Mrs Heng. GROWING PAINS She feels guilty sometimes that her children might be growing up faster than their friends. “But I hope, as a mother, I’ve given them enough personal space when they’re growing up,” she said. At the same time, she believes that, with so many siblings, “they do develop responsibility for each other”. It is also a good way to foster their peer engagement skills, added her husband. One thing that Mrs Heng still feels guilty about is Hannah’s speech delay. The five-year-old can repeat words but is not speaking in sentences yet, and must be referred to a speech therapist. Her mother frets that she may have not done enough when the girl was two years old. “I was expecting Isabella, so sometimes I wonder if it’s because I was too tired, and then I didn’t communicate enough with her,\" she said. With all that the family has had to manage, quality bonding time has not been easy to come by, let alone getting all nine to go out together. Chinese New Year was one such rare occasion. That is why Mr Heng recently organised an overnight stay for them at a chalet in Changi, saying it was “very much needed for us as a family”. “This short, one-day getaway did wonders for the kids, and also I sense that it relieved certain stresses off my shoulders and Esther’s shoulders,” he said, vowing to put more effort into his family and his marriage. One piece of good news he shared with them: He'd be returning to a full-time job, with regular hours and better pay than the S$2,600 he used to get. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Overall, how do the couple feel about having seven children – the number they have stopped at definitively? “It’s quite enjoyable to see them grow up together,” Mrs Heng said with a smile, though she sometimes wonders how her life would have been if she'd had only two or three children. Her husband said: “If I were to restart this whole thing, I may even have had more.” The Hengs are one of three large Singaporean families who share their stories on On The Red Dot. The final episode of this four-part series airs on Mediacorp Channel 5 on Friday, June 29, at 9.30pm.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/raising-7-children-under-3000-month-singapore-large-family-10462664"}, {"datetime": "24 Jun 2018 06:00AM", "tags": ["Russia", "society"], "author": "Justin Ong", "title": "Hateful stares, police pressure and ‘go back to China’: The Singaporeans making a living in Russia", "content": " MOSCOW: Jack Wong is a hardy, 50-year-old man who isn’t afraid to admit how he would cry at home nearly every night, when he first started work in Moscow 10 years ago. “I couldn’t speak a single word of Russian!” said the chef, who’d also left his wife and daughter back in Singapore. “Then, the police were not friendly when they saw Asians. One took my passport, walked away and didn’t want to give it back.” Upon the advice of the owner of the restaurant he works at, Asia Hall Live Kitchen, Wong offered the policeman some money - and got his passport back. The same method worked when airport officials wanted to send him back to Singapore, for carrying luggage full of local food products. “This is how they work,” he shrugged. Wong has also been robbed at knifepoint by a taxi driver, though he confessed to slipping up by being slightly inebriated and making the mistake of hailing a cab on the streets.  Fortunately, two of his fellow Singaporeans working in Russia, Amos Chia and Loretta Marie Perera, have not been targeted by criminals - but spoke of similar instances of overt racism. Singapore’s embassy to Russia said the number of Singaporeans in Moscow “typically fluctuates between 40 to 50”, and “only a handful” live in other parts of Russia. Chia, 28, is a conductor who recently wrapped a six-year course at the Saint Petersburg State Conservatory. He recalled a professor once berating him: “Why are you so stupid? Go back to China, go back to your farm!” “Just this week, a conductor told me I would never conduct any good operas because I’m Asian,” said Chia, who is engaged to a Russian lawyer. “And the Russians don’t like the Kazakhs and Central Asians. If you look like them - like me - you’ll get stopped on the streets and asked for your passport. I’ve also had to scan my bag at the metro even though my fiance doesn’t have to,” he added. Loretta Marie Perera, social media editor at English-language publication The Moscow Times, said the same. “I’ve gotten checks on my bags and when I ask why, they say it’s ‘random’ but then you realise everyone being checked is a non-white person,” the 30-year old noted. “The other thing is people in the subway look at you differently,” said Perera, who has resided in Moscow with her American husband for nearly two years. “You’re just doing your own thing and you realise there’s someone staring hatefully at you.” “A LOT SAFER”? Perera was working in Beijing before deciding to move somewhere else to learn a new language and experience a new city. “Russia is a cool place to live geographically, because you can travel to so many places,” she pointed out. “Internet is fast, housing is cheap for a big city, and I’m in love with the Moscow Metro.” “It’s also relatively safe here, and not just during the World Cup,” said Perera. “The cops come down really hard on people who break the law, so there's a lot less incentive for someone to get caught stealing a wallet with like five dollars in it. “But I do avoid taking taxis myself, though that’s the case everywhere. Russia really is a lot safer than anywhere else in Europe and US, but you obviously can’t compare to Singapore.\" For Chia, it is also a case of Russian culture and its people’s appetite for art - an environment which he said has changed him as a musician. And Wong, too, sees the professional benefits of his time in Russia.  The former head chef at IndoChine’s group of restaurants first accepted the job in Moscow because the offer was attractive, and he had an eye on building an overseas portfolio.  “I only imagined staying for one year. Next thing you know, it’s 10!” he laughed. Twice he resigned, citing family and homesickness, and twice the owner increased his salary. Now Wong has a team of 32 reporting to him, and he’s found his niche catering to more affluent Russians who’ve holidayed in the likes of Bangkok and Bali, and developed a taste for Southeast Asian food. “MORE COMFORTABLE NOW, BUT…” Wong eventually plans to strike out and start his own business elsewhere in the city. He wanted his family to join him, but balked at the fees for enlisting his daughter, 16, in an international school in Moscow.  “I slowly adapted and I’m more comfortable now, but it’s still boring being alone,” he chuckled. “I mostly just stay home, watch Hong Kong movies and serials, clean the house and cook food for myself.” Though she was once afraid to go out on her own, Perera, too, now feels confident enough to travel alone to different Russian cities. She also organised a women’s march in Moscow at the start of last year, to join thousands around the world protesting at US president Donald Trump’s inauguration. “It gets more appealing the longer I stay, because you have to put so much effort into everything you do here,” Perera added. “In Singapore, everything is so easy, if you need something just apply for it and things just work. Here, we are approaching two years and I only just got my work visa.” She did not rule out staying in Russia for the long term. Chia, on the other hand, said his ultimate goal was to give back to his country.  “I want to learn what I can here; grow as a musician so I can make a change in classical music in Singapore, to put our scene closer to that in the Western world,” he said.  “I still want to do something in Singapore. It’s home.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hateful-stares-police-pressure-and-go-back-to-china-the-10462410"}, {"datetime": "23 Jun 2018 06:28AM", "tags": ["World Cup", "football", "referee"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'Passionate about football, until the last breath': The Singaporean referee who made World Cup history", "content": " SINGAPORE: Madam Vallambal Suppiah, 87, has caught every game of the World Cup so far. While some of the names, faces and countries may be a bit of a blur, there is one figure she always keeps an eye on – the referee. “I like to watch all the referees and what they do. Sometimes I know the mistakes they make as well,\" Mdm Suppiah told Channel NewsAsia. \"I feel very sad when the game starts and I see the referees there. But, I have to change my thinking and then I cheer when I watch the game.” The reason for Mdm Suppiah's focus on the man in the middle - and her sadness? Her late husband was the first Singaporean to officiate at the World Cup. Mr Govindasamy Suppiah, better known as George, was the man in charge of the first round game between Poland and Haiti at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany. The Poles won the game 7-0, but Mr Suppiah was the headline act back in Singapore. It would take another 32 years for a Singaporean to follow in his footsteps, when Shamsul Maidin refereed in Germany during the 2006 tournament. \"I didn't understand the magnitude of the whole thing,\" said his daughter Shamini, who was seven at the time. \"But there was a lot of hype. I know there was a lot of talk in the newspapers, in the media and the news - everything.\" Ms Shamini recalled how neighbours would gather at their family home in Owen Road to watch football matches. Among those who lived nearby were the likes of former Singapore coach Choo Seng Quee and later, local football star Dollah Kassim. \"It was a pre-war shophouse, so the living room on the ground level was very huge. And we had lots of neighbours and not many had a television, so they would watch the games at our house,\" she added.  Mr Suppiah went on to be the linesman for two more games in the tournament, Sweden against Bulgaria and Brazil against the Netherlands.  \"To be truthful, I actually hated the game,\" said Ms Shamini. \"Only because it took dad away all the time. I knew he was busy, nothing but soccer. It was always about football. We hardly saw him during that time and I guess with the training and everything else, it helped him become a World Cup referee. \"There was a lot of time spent on this. I remember his grapefruit diet. I remember the runs he used to do to make sure that he was fit enough for the World Cup. He was always a fit person, and he was always into sports but there was a lot of extra training that went into it.\" A no-nonsense official, Mr Suppiah was a “strict but fair referee”, said Mdm Vallambal. A set of little drums he brought back from the tournament would serve to highlight that. “Apparently, at one of the matches he was refereeing, it was kind of a violent crowd and they threw the drums because they weren't happy with the decisions,” said Ms Shamini. “And he brought them back as souvenirs! So that's always in my memory.\" Born in 1929, Mr Suppiah was an avid sportsman who swam, participated in athletics, and also played tennis, hockey, squash. But football was his first love. The second referee in the family after his older brother Muthusamy, Mr Suppiah took up officiating before he turned 25. \"He had a lot of stories of how he did not come from a very wealthy family so he did not even have a pair of boots or shoes to play,\" said Shamini. \"He used to play soccer barefoot to start with, and eventually he worked very hard at becoming a referee and he excelled in it and the rest is history.\" A school teacher by trade, Mr Suppiah became a FIFA referee in 1967. He went on to referee numerous international 'A' matches before becoming a FIFA refereeing instructor in 1979. But even after he retired from the game, Mr Suppiah was never too far from the thick of the action. He would faithfully follow World Cup matches on television, catching games together with his family. \"He would comment on the referee's performance and took notes down,\" said Ms Shamini. \"Especially if there was any controversy, he would know that the next day the media would be after him to ask about comments for the radio and newspapers.\" In fact, it was his love for the World Cup that was one of the contributing factors behind his \"degeneration in health\", said his daughter.   \"I can't remember if it was three or four World Cups ago that he was actually watching every single match, because they used to call from the radio station and ask him for opinions of what he thinks the game would turn out like,\" said Ms Shamini. \"There was a year that he had actually done this and missed his exercising throughout the whole one month and that actually led to him losing his toe. Because he didn't do the (daily) exercise, so there was not enough circulation and he suffered from diabetes - and that led to him losing his toe.\"  But even after losing two toes, Mr Suppiah, who by then was pushing 80, would still turn up at the Farrer Park field to coach children under his charge.  He died at the age of 83 after an extended battle with diabetes. For members of the Suppiah family, watching the World Cup brings bittersweet memories. \"(The World Cup) means my father, that's what it means to us. And it's very hard to get through a season, without thinking about it and it just makes us miss him even more,\" said Shamini. \"We hear his voice in the background, we hear so many things he would have said, what he would have done, when a referee makes a decision right or wrong, what he felt about it, comments about the players, what they should be doing, what's wrong, what's right.\" \"I have to remember the World Cup. George Suppiah, I am proud of that,\" added Mdm Vallambal without hesitation.

This can be done, for instance, by integrating HDB rental and sold flats within individual blocks. Housing inequality mirrors wider economic inequality. Particular housing policies furthers the gap between the housing standards accessible to people with different economic capacities. While social diversity in geographical communities is important for many reasons, it is not sufficient for reducing these real inequalities in housing experience. More direct interventions are also needed. READ: Inequality has a geographic dimension - between and within neighbourhoods in Singapore, a commentary.  READ: Reviewing proximity-based admissions to good schools, a commentary. READ: Social stratification, a poison seeping into Singapore's housing estates, the Big Read. HOUSING INEQUALITY AND HOUSING POLICIES Social mixing is sometimes regarded as a way to avoid ghettorisation in Singapore. Comparisons are drawn with places like the US where poverty concentration in large subsidised housing projects has been associated with neighbourhood deterioration and poor social outcomes. But public rental housing in Singapore is thinly dispersed across many towns. Single or pairs of rental blocks are found alongside sold housing. Ghettorisation is therefore not the problem here. Instead the main concern is the wide gap in housing resources and experiences between public rental tenants and flat owners. This housing inequality is the result of forces beyond the housing system as well as specific housing policies. In our public housing system, market participation and performance translate directly into CPF wealth, personal savings and purchasing power.  Over the years, the steady introduction of public housing options at the top end both responded to and encouraged “upgrading” aspirations. Housing was promoted as investment for old age income security. Housing consumption therefore bears the imprint of general economic inequality resulting from the interaction of market earnings, redistributive policies and familial resources. These forces produce the unequal groups we are now finding ways to integrate in housing estates. Housing experiences will be less uneven when society as a whole is more equal. From the early 1980s, the construction of smaller flat types for sale stopped, to be resumed only in the 2000s. Meanwhile larger flats ceased to be offered in the public rental scheme. The profound differences in the public housing system today – smaller flats to let and larger flats for sale – are the result of these decisions. RENTAL HOUSING POLICY MAY BE PRODUCING WORRYING SEGREGATION Housing inequality is also felt through specific rental housing policies. People who need public rental housing face many hardships. The income ceiling of S$1,500 per month has not been raised since 2003, which means it has become much stricter in real terms. This ceiling directly penalises families with more children because it disregards household size. Space and privacy are persistent issues, as only 1- and 2-room flats are available to rent and the single tenant is required to share a flat with another unrelated person. Short tenancies of two years create insecurity. Although the tenancies are routinely renewed and evictions are unheard of, tenants are concerned because they have no legal basis to remain in their flats beyond the two years offered each time. As the building of new rental flats stopped completely between 1982 and 2006, most of the rental housing stock is very old. A survey I conducted with more than 1,000 households in 2016 found that rental tenants are far more likely to report problems with their living conditions, such as with estate hygiene and maintenance, than the average HDB resident. Anxiety about housing is common. The most worrying segregation in public housing is therefore not in the patterns of social interaction or the physical locations of rental and sold flats, but the standards and quality of the rental and ownership housing regimes. DIRECT INTERVENTIONS TO NARROW HOUSING INEQUALITY NEEDED Since 2014, the HDB has introduced integrated blocks that combine rental and sold housing in several BTO developments. This extends the longstanding policy of having diverse flat types within each town, and refines the grain of tenure mixing from the neighbourhood to the block level. Living in close proximity increases opportunities for meaningful interactions that encourage mutual understanding. More diverse social networks can generate economic opportunities for the individual and build social trust.  Diversity also promotes shared access to public spaces and accords with our instinct to build a strong national identity. However, neighbourhood diversity does not guarantee social cohesion. Studies across different countries have found that ethnic diversity within a locality can be associated with weaker social trust and withdrawal from civic participation. Empathy and cohesion are built not just on physical co-existence but also shared experiences, including housing experiences.  The stark differences between rental and ownership in terms of housing access, quality, security, and choice will not be softened through friendly mingling with neighbours. They have to be directly addressed. PRESSING NEED FOR BETTER RENTAL HOUSING CONDITIONS Better access to rental housing requires reasonable income ceilings that reflect population earnings and household size, and an adequate housing supply. Although the rental housing stock has been growing since 2006, once the income ceiling fairly reflects current income standards, the eligible applicant pool is likely to increase significantly. A larger rental housing supply that covers a higher proportion of the population has the additional advantage of drawing greater public support than the current system which may be seen as benefiting a small minority. Housing quality should not be overlooked for people who are unable to afford ownership.  Quality may be measured against basic space standards that respect needs for privacy and dignity. The expansion of the rental housing stock will allow co-residing singles to get their own flats and provides an opportunity to introduce larger flat types for bigger families. Security may come from longer tenancies so residents need not worry about shelter. For a start, these could be offered to families with children who will benefit from having a stable living arrangement, and persons who have very little prospect to improve their income situations due to physical and mental limitations. As for choice, there could be more flexible options between two-year rentals and purchases of 99-year leases. A less discontinuous menu of housing options will increase the chances for mobility. The short-lease options for 2-room Flexi flats for older people is already a move in this direction. READ: 99-year HDB leases a chance to review home ownership and retirement policies, a commentary. READ: Singapore’s public housing policy has done its job splendidly. Maybe it is time for a makeover? A commentary. Homeownership offers clear advantages to those who can afford it, such as housing security and asset accumulation. But it also comes with challenges. Financing housing requires sustained, stable employment with adequate pay, which may not always be attainable. In the CPF system, homeownership is often achieved at the expense of cash savings for retirement. Monetisation schemes address this issue but expose old-age income security to the volatility of the housing market and are further complicated by the expiry of HDB flat leases. Therefore choice must also mean respecting that people are able to decide whether and when they are ready for homeownership, and recognising that those who need long-term rental housing have housing needs now which need to be met. The current concern for better social mixing stems from recognition that there are two housing regimes – public renting and ownership – for people from different economic classes. These regimes offer vastly unequal experiences that are largely shaped by non-geographical factors. Rather than maintaining this differentiation and physically co-locating the flats, housing inequality can be narrowed by better meeting every resident’s housing needs, regardless of economic resources. In this way, housing policy can provide the foundation for a more equal society.

Speaking at the Hotel Intercontinental where his proposed slate of eight candidates for the committee was unveiled, Mr Tang said that the need to instill discipline was a priority and a strong \"code of conduct\" vital.  The other seven members of his team are former Olympians Poh Seng Song and Ang Peng Siong, Mr Malik Aljunied, Ms Sheena Hu, Mr S Govindaraju, Mr Kenny Lim and Ms Belinda Foo. The election is slated to be held next month - subject to an approval for a change in SA's constitution from the Registry of Societies (ROS). Should the ROS endorse these changes, the management committee will be elected at the SA's next annual general meeting.  The SA has been hit with internal strife and politicking between executive members in recent times, with an extraordinary general meeting being called in May 2017, 10 months after current president Ho Mun Cheong took office.  While Mr Ho has stayed on in his role, there was further conflict between members of SA’s management committee, with leaked screenshots of a WhatsApp chat which seemed to show instructions for SA staff members to land coaches in trouble. \"The code of conduct applies to the association, and the stakeholders, to instill in them the core values of what it is to be a member,\" said Mr Tang. Mr Tang, who is also an oil trader, twice held the position of SA president, serving his first stint from 2004 to 2006 and then from 2010 to 2016. He had cited disagreements in the executive committee as well as what he called the lack of unity within the management as some of the reasons behind his departure. Pointing to the one year suspension of top Thai sprinter Jirapong Meenapra late last year for sneaking out of a training camp, Mr Tang said that the newly elected committee would need the \"gumption\" to make such decisions with local athletes. \"I think we've got to instill (discipline) in our current crop of not only national athletes. It should be from the days when they are kids, when they are young in primary school, secondary school and progressing up the ecosystem,\" he added.  \"But I want to extend that to not just athletes, but officials and coaches as well. A lot of coaches are not working with each other, saying I'm better than you, you're better than me, I'm the best, and something has to be done.\"  But Mr Tang added that it was vital to leave the past behind. \"We have to consider the past but we are not going to dwell on it which means that whether the incumbent team is good or bad is irrelevant,\" said Mr Tang.  \"It is important that the team which is given the responsibility of managing track and field in Singapore works together, and cohesively to help bring about improvements in the sport across multiple levels.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/discipline-a-priority-as-tang-and-team-seek-to-leave-singapore-10460498"}, {"datetime": "22 Jun 2018 08:06PM", "tags": ["transportation", "Land Transport Authority", "SMRT"], "author": "Vimita Mohandas", "title": "Hands-free ticketing technology on trial at 4 MRT stations", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new hands-free ticketing technology is on a six-month trial at four MRT stations – making it easier for those with disabilities to enter and exit the stations. Launched by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and ST Engineering, the technology removes the need for commuters to tap their EZ-Link card at the fare gates. Instead, they can just pass through the fare gates using a Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) Test Card or a Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone with a dedicated application.  Redhill and Tiong Bahru MRT stations were chosen due to their proximity to SG Enable, an agency dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities as well as SPD. The other two MRT stations are Bedok and Kembangan – as they are located near LTA’s Bedok campus, which makes it easier for authorities to monitor the operational impact of the trial. This hands-free technology is welcome news for wheelchair-user Rohaizad Roslan - one of 50 participants taking part in the trial. Having been in a wheelchair for the last four years, the 39-year-old said getting his way around MRT stations hasn’t always been a smooth ride. \"There were a few times I knocked into the gantry while trying to tap the card and manoeuvre my way through. So it caused accidents and it could damage the gantry. When using the manual wheelchair, I also had to rush in because when I tap the card, I need to wheel myself into the gantry. So with this RFID card, I can just concentrate going through the gantry.\" Speaking to reporters at Redhill MRT station, Senior Minister of State for Transport Dr Janil Puthucheary said this is part of ongoing efforts to make Singapore's rail system more inclusive. \"We see our public transport system as a key enabler for all persons who have some issues with mobility. Whether you're a person with disability, a mother with a pram, or an elderly person who finds it difficult to get around, we want our public transport system to be able to serve everybody.\" Dr Janil said the trial period will also help authorities fine-tune the system: \"When I tried it just now, the card was around my neck and it was difficult to sense, partly maybe it's a height issue where the gantry is. When I had it in my pocket, it was very easy.  \"So these are some fine tuning things, getting the sensitivity of the sensor correct, getting the design of the gate correct, maybe even getting the design of the card or the form factor - does it need to be in a card or phone or a wearable.

But seeing how people are now making baseless and false allegations against those close to me—simply by mere association-- I have decided to confront the facts instead of leaving them subject to speculation. I did not want to let any more people down.  The outrage regarding how I have conducted myself is justified and I accept full responsibility for my actions and all consequences that arise from those actions.  I was wrong to have claimed that stock images and other people’s work were my own. I was also wrong to have used false captions that misled my followers and those who viewed my images. Having marketed myself as a photographer, I fell far short of what was expected of me and disappointed those who believed—or wanted to believe— in me. For all of that, I apologise.  Those close to me disagree with my actions and have asked, whenever they felt that something was not right about my images, that I stop my actions immediately. I did not take their advice seriously and would give reasons that I thought would assuage any concerns they had over those images—just enough so that we would move on to other issues. I let them down with my actions.  I would also like to take the opportunity to clear the air. The end-products of my collaborations with my friends remained honest and fair. Whatever my shortcomings were, I did not bring them to my collaborations. That would not have been fair to those who collaborated with me, and they would not have allowed such practices to be carried out in any event. These people are hard-working professionals and I was hurt to see people make baseless allegations or insinuations against them or question their integrity. They should not be hounded for my errors. To that end, I hope that these baseless allegations or insinuations would stop.  I know I have erred and hope that I will be given the time and space to grow and better myself. For those who have stood by me, I would like to thank you and hope that I will be able to earn such kindness in the future.

At the time of the offences, Koh Dawei, 34, was employed by Venda Engineering & Trading, an external vendor that provided maintenance and repair jobs for SBS Transit at Soon Lee Bus Depot. Koh conspired with his accomplice, Ong Sang Fei, 47, to set up another company Azech Engineering to perform ad hoc jobs at the depot. In reality though, those jobs were done by Venda's technicians at the depot. Ad hoc jobs involve having a foreman obtain quotes from approved contractors, as well as approval from the workshop manager to award the job to a particular contractor. Koh and Ong agreed that Azech would issue quotations and invoices in its name, but that the actual jobs would be done by Venda's technicians.  When Azech received payment from SBS Transit, Koh would receive 17 per cent of the proceeds, while Ong would receive 83 per cent. The pair received a total of S$66,610.50 in invoice payments on 20 occasions between 2013 and 2015.

On Friday (Jun 22), the man was sentenced to 12 years in jail for the crimes. He cannot be caned as he is above the age of 50. Both parties cannot be named due to a gag order.  In March 2015, three months after his daughter, her husband and the victim had moved in with him and his wife, the man made his first move on his grandson.  The boy was watching television after school when the man asked him to follow him into the room. When they were on the bed, he kissed his grandson and undressed him, then himself.  He then molested the boy. He however stopped and dressed himself hurriedly when he heard the family’s maid enter the home. He told the boy to wear his shorts and warned him not to tell anyone what happened, as “as it would create problems with his parents”, according to court documents.  SEXUAL ASSAULT A YEAR LATER The man was in a drug rehabilitation centre from Dec 1, 2015 to Sep 18, 2016. Just 10 days after his release, he sexually assaulted his grandson again. The man again asked the boy, who had turned eight, to follow him into the bedroom. When they lay on the bed together, he again undressed the boy and himself. This time, he sexually assaulted him with his finger.  He stopped when the boy felt pain and cried out. After telling the boy not to tell anyone about what had happened, he washed his finger in an adjoining toilet.  After leaving the bedroom briefly, the accused went back to the said toilet and masturbated, the court heard. The sexual offences came to light a month later. The boy’s mother noticed that he was playing with his mobile phone at night, even after she told him to rest early, as he had to wake up early the next day to go to the temple with his family. She told him that if he was too tired to wake up in time, he would have to stay alone at home with his grandfather. The boy then told her that he did not want to be alone with his grandfather as he had molested him. The boy’s mother confronted her father, who admitted to his offences and asked for forgiveness. The boy then started crying. His mother made a police report the next day. MORAL CORRUPTION, SEVERE ABUSE OF TRUST AGGRAVATING FACTORS: JUDGE Calling for eight years' jail, the defence said the act itself was \"brief\" and \"limited\" and that the man had used only the tip of his finger. Judicial Commissioner Pang Khang Chau said he accepted that the accused's plea of guilt and his remorse were mitigating factors.  However, he said the fact raised by the defence that the accused was not a homosexual nor a paedophile, according to an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist, was not a relevant factor for sentencing. He said that aggravating factors included abuse of trust and moral corruption. Three other charges, including showing the boy pornography, were taken into consideration. For using criminal force to molest his grandson, a minor, the accused could have been jailed up to five years, caned, fined, or given a combination of punishments. For sexually assaulting a minor, he could have have faced between eight and 20 years in jail, and given at least 20 strokes of the cane. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-sexually-assaulted-eight-year-old-grandson-jailed-10459042"}, {"datetime": "22 Jun 2018 12:43PM", "tags": ["Qoo10", "scam", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Online shopping platform Qoo10 warns of survey reward email scam", "content": " SINGAPORE: Online shopping platform Qoo10 has warned its customers about an email scam that attempts to collect personal data by promising rewards upon the completion of a survey.

The developer of the project, Mandai Park Development (MPD), said speed bumps were put in place along Mandai Lake Road in 2016. The process of installing hoardings started at the end of 2016 before development works started in the first quarter of 2017.  But wildlife experts said more can be done to prevent roadkill. \"They need to be far more efficient and urgent than they are doing now. At the area where a pangolin and leopard cat died, there are still no hoardings even till today,\" said veteran wildlife consultant Subaraj Rajathurai.  The hoardings, which prevent animals from getting onto the roads and guides them to a safer crossing, are still being installed in phases up to this year, said wildlife experts.  Channel NewsAsia understands that the hoardings are added in phases as the project progresses. When Channel NewsAsia visited the area, the hoardings were largely limited to the Mandai Lake Road area and not along Mandai Road, which flanks the northern region of the reserve.  \"Due to forest clearing as part of the development, wildlife which inhabit these areas will be forced to move around and are at risk of getting on adjacent busy roads or highways where hoardings are not present,\" said Ms Anbarasi Boopal, deputy chief executive of Animal Concerns Research and Education Society's (ACRES). \"More speed calming measures and complete barriers must be in the right places, not just with the development but the surrounding areas where the displaced animals could move to along the main roads to prevent animal crossings and roadkill,\" she added.   On slowing the traffic along Mandai Lake Road, Dr Lee Hui Mien, MPD's vice president of sustainable solutions, said that a series of speed reduction measures has been put in place. The speed limit for most parts of the road has been reduced to 40kmh. This is further reduced to 20kmh at a stretch near the nature reserve that has been identified as a temporary crossing area for wildlife. MPD said in January this year, an additional speed radar was installed and the number of speed humps and wildlife crossing signs increased. Road markings to indicate wildlife crossing areas were also added.  A rope bridge has also been installed along Mandai Lake Road to help arboreal animals such as squirrels and macaques move across safely, with another set currently underway, it added. Dr Lee said that when MPD was conceptualising the bridge, they had expected the animals to begin using it only after three to six months. \"Because animals are habitual, it will take some time for them to get used to it. But surprisingly we were very heartened to know that after a week of erecting the bridge we do see macaques crossing,\" Dr Lee said. She added that images captured by cameras indicate that the macaques using the bridge\"seem to be enjoying themselves\". \"We’ve seen them crossing the bridge, sitting on the side of the bridge looking down at traffic – we’ve even seen them mating on the bridge,\" Dr Lee added.  Drivers of vehicles such as taxis, private hire cars and buses that regularly ply the Mandai area have also been engaged to raise awareness on speed calming measures, said Dr Lee.  However, Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum's research associate Sivasothi N said that the hoardings and traffic calming plans have been up for \"a very short time\".  He noted that plans for the eco-tourism park were first announced in 2014 but work only started in 2017. \"That is very soon for an entity unfamiliar with development next to protected forests and the entire process has been hasty. The mitigation I've observed is slow and inadequate,\" said Mr Sivasothi.  \"The mitigations that are needed are not yet implemented,\" said the vice-chair of Nature Society's conservation committee, Mr Ho Hua Chew.  PLANNED ANIMAL OVERPASS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUILT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION STARTED Mr Ho was referring to a planned Eco-Link wildlife bridge to help animals living in the forested areas of Mandai cross roads without danger, similar to the existing Eco-Link@BKE crossing built between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Experts said that the bridge, which will only be ready by the end of 2019 ahead of other components of the project, could have helped prevent roadkill incidents. Mr Subaraj, who provided consultancy on the Mandai project, said various local wildlife groups had submitted recommendations to mitigate its impact on the local fauna. \"None of the mitigation measures recommended, including wildlife crossings ... to proper hoardings, everything was not in place when the developer started developing the area which shouldn't be the case. It should all have been in place then you start the development,\" said Mr Subaraj.  \"That's the normal procedure for anywhere where there is nature even more so when there is a nature reserve. That's really unfortunate,\" he added.  While the Eco-Link bridge is a \"great solution\" and can be used by most animals, Mr Subaraj added that installing more rope bridges will help arboreal animals that live in the rainforest tree canopy move across.  National University of Singapore's wildlife biologist Joanna Coleman said that the most effective strategy of mitigating wildlife affected by building works are overpasses.  \"Signage is probably the most common and cheapest mitigation measure implemented worldwide,\" said Dr Joanna Coleman. But a recent study showed they are ineffective, the wildlife biologist at the National University of Singapore added. \"If drivers in Singapore are generally more cautious or more likely than drivers elsewhere to obey road signs, then perhaps signage could work better here than elsewhere,\" Dr Coleman added.  DANGEROUS NOT JUST FOR ANIMALS, BUT ALSO FOR HUMANS \"When a large mammal strays onto a road, there's always a chance that it will cause a collision, resulting in human injury or death,\" Dr Coleman said. Three cars were involved in the accident with the pregnant wild boar. Last Sunday's incident where a wild Sambar deer had to be euthanised involved a taxi, motorcycle and a car as they tried to avoid the deer. The taxi driver suffered cuts and was taken to hospital. In May, a Malaysian motorcyclist took the Land Transport Authority and National Parks Board to court for negligence after a wild boar roadkill accident.  Mr Vicknesh Morthy suffered serious head injuries resulting in permanent disability after crashing into the carcass of a wild boar that was left along the BKE, near Eco-Link@BKE.  Apart from Sambar deer and wild boars, the reserve is also home to pangolins, Banded Leaf Monkeys, Common Palm Civets and leopard cats.   \"I think we will definitely see more encounters of this nature but what is scary is that ... if you're not very careful, it could lead to a fatality of a person on the roads. If a car hits a big Sambar deer at full pace, someone could get killed,\" Mr Subaraj said.  \"We need more wildlife crossings. We need speeds to be slowed down on certain roads especially along Mandai Road and Upper Thomson Road. And we need to have better understanding among the public that you are moving adjacent to a nature area and there is always a possibility of wildlife being around so let's be a little bit considerate and alert,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mandai-roadkill-developer-protective-measures-wildlife-experts-10446058"}, {"datetime": "22 Jun 2018 11:05AM", "tags": ["Land Transport Authority", "Grab", "ComfortDelGro", "private-hire cars", "transportation"], "author": "", "title": "23,000 private-hire drivers yet to obtain vocational licence a week before deadline", "content": " SINGAPORE: A total of 23,000 private-hire drivers have yet to obtain their vocational licence with just one week to go before the deadline, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Friday (Jun 22).

To facilitate applications for PDVL training and testing slots, LTA said it appointed ComfortDelGro Taxi as a new training provider, and the Employment and Employability Institute as a new test centre, in December last year.

LTA said about 19,900 ATD concession holders have attended and passed the test so far. “As at Jun 17, 2018, more than four in five of the remaining 23,000 ATD concession holders have not registered to sit for the test even once, despite reminders from the Land Transport Authority, Grab and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association, to do so,\" LTA said.  \"More than nine in 10 of these ATD concession holders who have not attempted the test a single time, have also not attended the PDVL training.\" ATD concession holders who have not obtained their PDVL, but wish to continue providing ride-hailing services after Jun 30, will need to reapply for the PDVL at a cost of S$40. ATD concession holders who have registered for the course and test before Jun 30, but have been scheduled for the tests in early July, need not reapply.

PDVL TRAINING AND TEST Since the implementation of the PDVL, around 70 per cent of applicants who took the test have passed, LTA said. “The provision of chauffeured service puts drivers in contact with a wide range of commuters every day. Hence, private-hire and taxi drivers must be able to speak simple English to communicate effectively with all commuters – both Singaporeans and tourists. \"Drivers must also be able to read English, so that they can navigate roads and buildings, the names of which are primarily in English.\" Drivers who require help with improving their command of English are encouraged to sign up for the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications Workplace Literacy Program or an equivalent. LTA said that it also constantly reviews the course and test curriculum content to make sure that they are updated and relevant. Drivers who provide ride-hailing services without a valid vocational licence face a fine of up to S$1,000 and up to three months' jail.

Apparently, they just eat, eat, eat – and take a lot of food photos. According to a new survey by Hotels.com, 87 per cent of Singaporean millennials admitted that food is the biggest deciding factor when deciding where to go – and 78 per cent said they spend most of their time munching their way around a place rather than visiting tourist landmarks (60 per cent) or shopping (40 per cent). The global Tasty Travels survey, which was conducted by One Poll in March, included 9,000 respondents across 29 countries, including 300 Singaporeans, aged between 18 and 35 years old. Topping the list of favourite destinations among Singaporean millennials was Tokyo, followed by Seoul, Paris, London, New York, Taipei and Bangkok. Meanwhile, Paris topped the overall global list. It was followed by Tokyo, Rome, London, New York, Barcelona and Madrid. But despite many of these places having quite a number of Michelin-starred restaurants, Singaporean millennials are actually looking at the other end of the spectrum when they eat – only 12 per cent prefer to check out fine-dining options and instead go for local street food (36 per cent). On average, they also take around 157 photos during a weeklong holiday – a fifth of which are of food or F&B establishments. A third of the Singaporean respondents also admitted they preferred taking Instagram-worthy photos of their meals over photos with friends or selfies. In fact, food figures so much that it’s what millennials remember most on their travels. A whopping 90 per cent said local food experiences are what stands out during holidays. Tourist attractions and shopping? Not so much, at 43 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. “Experiences are the new wealth and food provides one of life’s most pleasurable experiences, where there’s always something new to try when you travel. So, it’s understandable that younger generations of travellers are defining their holiday by what they can eat, how they eat it, and how good the ‘Grams’ will be while they’re away,” said Jessica Chuang, Hotels.com’s regional marketing director of greater China, Southeast Asia and India.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/singapore-millennials-food-destinations-eating-holiday-tokyo-10458484"}, {"datetime": "22 Jun 2018 09:31AM", "tags": ["animals", "traffic accidents", "wild boars"], "author": "", "title": "Pregnant wild boar killed in accident on BKE", "content": " SINGAPORE: A pregnant wild boar was killed in an accident involving three cars on the Bukit Timah Expressway towards Woodlands on Thursday evening (Jun 21).

Channel NewsAsia understands that the three cars were travelling on the right-most lane when the wild boar crossed the expressway from left to right. Two of the cars ran over the wild boar, while the third car collided into the second car. The police said they were alerted to the accident at 7.40pm and that investigations are ongoing.

Consider virtual assistants such as Nanyang Technological University’s humanoid robot receptionist Nadine, and robotic instructors, known as RoboCoaches, that lead fitness classes for the elderly, demonstrate exercises, and offer encouragement here in Singapore.

As for businesses, AI is on the uptake, with research showing that 73 per cent of Singaporean organisations plan to make investments in AI over the next year. NEW DEVELOPMENTS, HOT TOPIC With AI occupying such a prominent place in Singapore’s business and social aspects of life, the recent announcement by Minster for Communications and Information S Iswaran on the appointment of a new council to advise the Singapore Government on the ethical use of AI and data is timely. Not only is the council tasked with driving awareness of the benefits and challenges of AI, it will develop ethics standards and issue advisory guidelines and codes of practice for voluntary adoption by businesses. Ethics and technology are an increasingly hot topic. Earlier this month, Stanford University, located in Silicon Valley, said it would introduce ethics into its technology and research programmes. Meanwhile, MIT, recently appointed what it calls a “humanist chaplain” to help entrepreneurial students think through the ethical ramifications of their studies and work. UNCHARTERED GROUND It is good to see more people contemplating a host of issues, such as: Who is responsible for information and how is it managed? Are we prepared for the displacement of some old jobs and the creation of new jobs that require additional training? How can technology and long-standing public institutions come together to make our new technology-driven world a place where we can enjoy all the benefits that AI provides, but within appropriate ethical boundaries? Who is responsible for the outcome of decisions made by AI? More so than any other technology we’ve seen, AI is raising questions about “the unchartered”, or the unknown. Citizens and businesses are looking for answers to help navigate the new machine driven economy. READ: The future of work, a dystopian reality? A commentary. READ: Smart speakers will take over the world? Don’t make me laugh, a commentary. This is where this initiative by the Singapore Government will play an important role in shaping the way AI is applied in the future, its impact on Singaporean citizens, and how both citizens and businesses approach it. REDUNDANCY FEARS REMAIN, SO ENGAGEMENT NEEDED One of the biggest fears of moving towards an AI-dominated world is the fear of redundancy - that our skills won’t be relevant anymore and we risk being displaced by something faster, more efficient, and smarter than us. This applies to businesses as well and the risk of an industry or service becoming less relevant.   The truth is technology innovation does lead to disruption and oftentimes displacement. However, the solution isn’t to stop evolving and innovating. Rather, businesses, workers as well as the Government need to anticipate disruption and proactively build strategies to develop the skills and jobs that will be needed in the future.  This is why we all need to be engaged in this discussion to ensure that as a society we’re moving towards embracing AI in an ethical manner, finding a place for everyone and making sure that that we focus on the right things to propel us forward as a society. READ: Digital readiness blueprint needs to consider 'invisible illiteracies', a commentary. A SHIFT, TECH IN EVERY INTERACTION There’s a transformation at play – a shift beyond digital into an era where tech is built into every single interaction. It’s important that executives understand the IT trends that are rapidly reshaping not just daily life but society as a whole, and that businesses – in every industry – reimagine what is possible. This is where ethics come into play – providing guidelines and boundaries for the ways that industries will have to change in terms of accountability and responsibility for the decisions that machines make on our behalf. While we can’t expect all the questions surrounding AI to be answered by the council itself, this new council is a step forward in bringing some clarity to at least the unanswered questions surrounding ethics and the ethical boundaries of how AI is likely to shape businesses going forward.   AN INGREDIENT IN A TRANSFORMING CITY AI can be used as a transformational business tool and a very useful consumer service. It is changing how companies operate and people live. But executives shouldn’t just look at it as a means to grow their businesses and people shouldn’t just think of it as a nifty extra. We should look at AI as a tool that enhances human capabilities – making people better and happier at their jobs, prompting customers to be more satisfied with services and confident in a company’s brand.  It should be an ingredient in creating a city that transforms the way of life of its citizens, boosting quality of life. Used ethically, we can all look forward to a new and exciting future with opportunities far beyond our imagination. Gianfranco Casati is Group Chief Executive Growth Markets at Accenture.

I don’t like getting dirty.” Despite her interest in sports, Eynarah was reluctant to join her school’s girls’ football team because of that. But she had a change of heart when she found out that the field she would play on was made of synthetic turf – which meant she would be less likely to return home from games or practice dirty and covered in mud. Woodlands Secondary is one of 142 schools in Singapore to have benefitted from the Education Ministry’s Synthetic Turf Programme. The programme, which has been implemented since 2006, hopes to give schools more flexibility to schedule PE lessons, field sports and games without having to worry about over-use affecting the condition of the field. And cleaner students are indeed another benefit, according to Woodlands Secondary’s head of PE Mohamed Razif. “We use the field not just for football training, but for PE lessons as well, and students would have to return to class right after that,” he said. “So when we only had the natural field, the students would get muddy on rainy days, which was quite a big disadvantage.” SYNTHETIC FIELDS MORE COST-EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG RUN: MOE  But cleanliness aside, MOE said these fields are more cost-effective in the long run compared to natural turf. The ministry told Channel NewsAsia that each synthetic turf field costs an estimated S$200,000 to S$500,000 to install, depending on size. It is also cheaper to maintain - costing about S$3,000 per year. At Meridian Junior College (MJC), maintenance takes place about four times a year. It involves topping up the rubber infill granules, and brushing the artificial grass with a tractor - a process which takes about three to four hours, according to MJC’s head of PE and CCA Seah Joo Yee. In contrast, the process of maintaining a natural field could take much longer, according to Woodlands Secondary’s Mr Razif. “When we had our normal field, we would have to request that the maintenance be done during the holidays, because it could take about a month or so,” he said. “They would have to put in more soil, and wait for the grass to grow, and even then, it doesn’t always turn out that well because of the rain.” MOE said synthetic turf fields allow \"schools with heavy field usage and niche field sports to schedule more outdoor field activities and develop competitive field sports.” The Synthetic Turf Programme is being rolled out to schools in phases, and schools can opt in based on their usage needs. According to Budget 2018's revenue and expenditure estimates, the total project cost of the Synthetic Turf Programme is about S$83.5 million, of which slightly over S$42 million has been spent so far. Schools which already have a synthetic field include Dunman High School, Bukit Panjang Government High School and Riverside Secondary School. An additional 10 schools will be getting a synthetic turf by 2019, said MOE. BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE DRAWBACKS, SAY SCHOOLS Apart from maintenance, schools with such fields also highlighted another benefit: That the conditions of the synthetic field remains the same regardless of what the weather conditions are. “It wasn’t as conducive to play on natural grass, because some areas were balding from repetitive use, and after it rains, the grass comes out when you kick it,” said MJC’s Ms Seah. “(The synthetic grass) is softer, and there’s less impact on the students’ knees and ankles when they run.” For serious football players like JC2 student and captain of MJC’s football team Nathanael Chin, the synthetic field also makes his gameplay more consistent. “When I play on a natural field, the ground condition can vary according to the weather,” he explained. “When it gets hot, the conditions are very hard and bumpy, and when it rains, it gets soft and muddy.” “All this will affect the way I pass the ball, run or move in the field.” Both teachers admitted there are drawbacks. For example, field events such as discus and javelin could no longer be done on the field, for fear of spoiling it. But this, said MJC’s Ms Seah, is “not much of a concern”, as the focus in the PE syllabus for schools has shifted away from such events. The rubber infill from the field also, according to Woodlands Secondary’s Mr Razif, “follows the students everywhere” after they use the field. “We always tell them to clear the black granules from their shoes before going for class,” he said. Nonetheless, both teachers stressed that the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Furthermore, Nathanael noted that it is becoming increasingly uncommon to find fields with natural turf. “I used to play outside leisurely, and I’d have to travel around different fields to use their facilities,” he said. “Most of them are synthetic fields, whether it’s located in a school or in a stadium.”   “Having the field here in the school also helps our students when they go out and play,” added Ms Seah. “It’s easier for them to adapt, and in fact, there is no transition for them at all.”  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/why-singapore-schools-turn-to-synthetic-turf-fields-10451860"}, {"datetime": "22 Jun 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Yoghurt"], "author": "Khoo Bee Khim", "title": "Fancy a yoghurt drink made with crushed egg shells?", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: It is not a concoction from the fictional world of Willy Wonka but an actual beverage by Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) students, which even made it to the finals of the 12th World Dairy Innovation Awards on Jun 20.

The unusual drink is the brainchild of students Ong Han Xuan, Chong Ke Ann, Tang Hwee Peng, and Nur Syafiqah Bte Zakaria from NYP’s Food Science and Nutrition department.

So what does it taste like? Imagine a flavour profile similar to Thai milk tea, with chewy bits of chia seeds for texture – something the team wanted to replicate to appeal to the bubble tea-loving crowd. Egg shells were used because they are calcium rich. Instead of sugar, the students used monk fruit extract, which is 300 times sweeter than sugar and has no calories.

Look into the camera,\" ordered a Singapore Prison Service officer, who works at Institution A4, the women's prison.  \"All inmates, at ease,\" she added, barely a minute later.  The prison was testing what is known as an automated muster checking system, one of three new technological initiatives SPS is trialling as it moves towards automating work processes in prison - or what it calls a \"prison without guards\" concept. Currently, muster checks are done manually by prison officers on the ground to account for inmates. The process has to be repeated a few times daily.  SPS is trialling facial recognition technology to replace these manual checks. Cameras located in the cells would capture the facial images of inmates and verify them with the records in the database, SPS said.  \"Only discrepancies will be highlighted to prison officers for further verification, cutting down the time spent on manual checks,\" SPS added.  Superintendent Chan Kai Yuen, who is the senior assistant director at SPS' transformation and technology division, told the media that the automated muster checks would make the process quicker.  He explained that manual checks would typically take 20-30 minutes, but facial recognition allows the process to be completed in 10 minutes.  Besides that, SPS is also trialling a human behaviour detection system known as Avatar. The system uses prototype video analytics to detect and alert prison officers to abnormal activities, such as fights, in cells.  \"Making use of video analytics, this surveillance system can detect acts of aggression using an algorithm that captures high intensity, erratic motions and various interaction points between two persons,\" the agency said.   Avatar is currently being experimented in a cell in a men's cluster at Changi Prison. According to Mr Chan, the test has so far been \"very promising\".  \"It has detected actual fights that occur in the cell. We are testing it in one cell now ... when the technology is ready, we will introduce this to all cells,\" said Mr Chan.  He added that SPS is still ironing out \"false alarms\" that could be triggered when inmates are exercising, for instance.  SPS is also trialling self-service vending machines that dispense items as varied as snacks and soaps. This process is done by matching an inmate's identity - via wrist tags embedded with electronic chips - with his weekly spending allowance.  The cost of the items bought is automatically deducted from the inmate's allowance.  \"This removes the need for officers to manually collate the inmate's purchase orders, update their allowance account and distribute the canteen items,\" SPS said.  Commenting on all the three technologies that are being trialled, Mr Chan said it allows officers to spend less effort on routine, more labour-intensive activities and free up their time to focus on \"higher order work\" such as rehabilitation.  \"We can sit down and talk, interact and understand the inmate better ... and help in charting a relevant rehabilitation programme,\" he said.  On top of the three systems being trialled, SPS has piloted an automated security equipment cabinet that allows officers to draw and return equipment safely, and a digital rehabilitation records management system that tracks inmates' movements. Inmates are also able to access e-books and e-learning through shared tablets. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-prison-raises-tech-bar-with-automated-checks-surveillance-10455870"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 09:09PM", "tags": ["crime"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "'Seasoned criminal' who cheated multiple victims in credit card, online scams gets 5 years' jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: A woman who was labelled a \"serial cheater who constantly expanded her criminal repertoire\" by the prosecution was on Thursday (Jun 21) sentenced to five years' jail on 15 charges covering a range of offences including cheating, housebreaking and drug crime.

In one case, she put up a property that she was renting on online marketplace Gumtree, pretending to be the owner. She then \"rented\" it out to a Japanese national who paid her S$3,581.60. When the Japanese national returned to Japan, Malani's boyfriend Prakash Mathivanan, 34, used a spare key to enter the unit and stole valuables worth S$37,300, passing them to Malani. Among the items were a Chanel clutch, a yellow diamond ring, a Cartier watch and several branded bags and shoes. The pair also collaborated in another case where they used a victim's credit card to buy S$2,968.80 worth of electronic goods on online marketplace QOO10.

The household name, which first made its mark in water treatment and later ventured into power generation, cited “prolonged weakness” in the local power market for the turnabout in fortunes.

The spokesperson added that Hyflux will work with investor advocacy group, Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS), to “effectively engage” all stakeholders.  “(We will) walk them through their queries and update them regarding our plans as much as we are able to,” it said, while noting that more townhall meetings could be held if necessary. “It is Hyflux’s duty to communicate as regularly as we are able to with our investors.” EXPECTING A “FAIRLY BIG NUMBER” OF INVESTORS: SIAS With the townhall meetings next month being the first that Hyflux will have with its 50,000-plus retail investors, SIAS, which is helping the company to organise these sessions, is expecting a “fairly big number” of stakeholders to turn up. As of Thursday, about 400 investors have indicated their interest, said SIAS president David Gerald. Should the sign-ups for each townhall meeting exceed 1,000 – the maximum capacity for the auditorium where the sessions will be held – alternative arrangements will be made, added Mr Gerald, who assured that the upcoming meetings will look to accommodate as many retail investors as possible. “We are organising this so that all investors can get detailed updates from the company,” he said, while noting that SIAS has facilitated about 20 such townhall meetings over the past year. “These have proved to be useful in helping investors to know where they stand and what is being done to bring the company back to its feet. Investors have the right to know.” Noting that SIAS is actively in touch with Ms Lum who has reiterated Hyflux’s commitment to “work hard to bring back value” for all investors, Mr Gerald added: “She has assured me that she will be on stage to explain what is happening and what she will be doing with her team.” Analysts Channel NewsAsia spoke to welcomed the townhall meetings as “positive” and “proactive” steps that Hyflux is taking to engage its huge group of mom-and-pop investors. iFast senior fixed income analyst Ang Chung Yuh said: “They’ve been proactive and have come out early to hold such meetings. This treatment of retail investors so far is pretty encouraging, which hopefully means that retail investors can get a fairer treatment relative to the other creditors.” Investors should seize the opportunity to ask questions about the company’s plans moving forward. “There’ll be a tendency to find out what went wrong but this is literally water under the bridge. This is a very positive platform for investors to voice their concerns in a systematic and formalised way to Hyflux, and I think the focus should be on what the company is doing to rescue the situation,” said Associate Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Business School. Echoing that, Mr Ang said: “The questions that need to be answered will be how Hyflux intends to approach the restructuring. More details should be given like whether there’ll be any debt-to-equity conversion involved.” He added: “Is the S$200 million in rescue financing enough and how long can that sustain them? Also, once this is done with, what’s their business model going to be like moving forward.\" On that note, Mr Gerald, who will be moderating the townhall sessions, urged stakeholders to attend the meetings to voice their concerns but at the same time, “exercise patience”. “You cannot have a resolution within one or two months and you can’t do fire sales because that would be against the interest of all stakeholders. To get the company back on its feet, it needs to inject working capital and look at long-term investments. That’s why investors must exercise patience.” ANOTHER COURT HEARING In a separate announcement late on Thursday, Hyflux said a court hearing with respect to an application for a moratorium by its subsidiary, Tuaspring, has been scheduled on Jul 6 at 2.30pm at the Supreme Court.  At the hearing earlier this week, Tuaspring obtained leave to discontinue its application for a debt moratorium and pursued a separate application. As such, the six-month reprieve from creditors granted on Tuesday only included Hyflux and four other subsidiaries, namely Hydrochem, Hyflux Engineering, Hyflux Membrane Manufacturing and Hyflux Innovation Centre. In the latest statement, the company clarified that Hyflux and these four subsidiaries under moratorium hold a cash balance of S$18.6 million as of Jun 4.  This amount “does not take into account amounts deposited in debt service reserve accounts as required by the project finance lenders or in fixed deposit accounts (over which there is no charge) as required by the banks issuing/renewing performance bonds, and amounts in overseas jurisdictions”, it said.  Hyflux and its subsidiaries are also in discussions with the project finance lenders of the TuasOne waste-to-energy project and the Qurayyat Integrated Water Project regarding access to funding to enable the completion of construction of these projects.  The statement added that Hyflux “consistently adopts an asset-light strategy” and will continue to explore divestment opportunities for its completed projects. In particular, the Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Project and the Tianjin Dagang Desalination Plant in China. “The Group is currently exploring multiple possible solutions as part of the court supervised reorganisation process, including but not limited to rescue financing and the seeking of suitable investors, and will provide an update when a firm proposal has been formulated,” it said.  “Any injection of funds from investors may be applied towards a multitude of uses within the Group, including to pursue potential projects and completion of pending projects, depending on the terms of investment and the needs of the Group at the time.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-founder-ceo-olivia-lum-to-attend-townhall-meetings-with-10456224"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 07:53PM", "tags": ["K-pop", "entertainment", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Police looking into video of TWICE concertgoer who chanted gang slogan", "content": " SINGAPORE: The police are looking into a video of a TWICE concertgoer heard chanting a gang-related slogan during the K-pop group's Singapore show earlier this week, they confirmed on Thursday (Jun 21).

The plan comes after the carrier announced last month it would absorb underperforming SilkAir into the parent brand after 2020 when a program to upgrade cabins at a cost of more than S$100 million (US$73.5 million) gets underway. Singapore Airlines has been undertaking a three-year transformation program designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers. Scoot recently began listing job ads for Boeing Co 737 jet pilots despite operating a narrowbody fleet of rival Airbus SE A320s. Singapore Airlines said in a statement on Thursday that it expected to transfer some of SilkAir's 737s to Scoot to help optimise the overall group's network, but it declined to provide further details such as the number of planes involved. As part of the transformation program, it has already transferred routes to five destinations in Southeast Asia from SilkAir to Scoot. Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an independent aviation research firm, said those destinations, which include Kuching and Langkawi in Malaysia, had a relatively low proportion of traffic transferring through the Singapore hub relative to other routes. Part of the reason Singapore Airlines is absorbing SilkAir is to better align the brands for travelers from long-haul destinations like Europe and North America using Singapore as a connecting hub, the airline said last month. Sobie said several Indonesian routes could be transferred from SilkAir to Scoot, as well as others like Chang Mai in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam. SilkAir has 32 737s on order. Sobie said it would have been more attractive for Scoot to add A320s for growth to keep its short-haul fleet all one type, but that would not have solved the problem of the looming 737 deliveries. \"Ultimately it is clear that Scoot needs additional capacity to take over more SilkAir routes and the transfer of the 737s was the best solution for the Singapore Airlines Group,\" he said. \"The route transfers should improve the group's profitability and long-term position, outweighing the additional costs associated with Scoot operating two narrowbody families.\" Sobie said he expected the first jets would be transferred in late 2018 or early 2019, giving the airline time to remove business class seats from SilkAir jets and to hire pilots.

Michael Heng, a business consultant in Singapore, said he got an invitation for a delegation to visit North Korea on Jun 13, the day after its leader, Kim Jong Un, and US President Donald Trump agreed in Singapore to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. \"We should start readying now, to get ready to rush the moment the doors open,\" Heng told Reuters. Heng said he had been discussing opportunities with a high-level North Korean contact for two months before the summit and he planned to take up to 18 Singaporean businessmen there in September to meet authorities and talk to other foreign business people there. Time was of the essence, he said. \"We need the first-mover advantage before the place gets swarmed by the Chinese or South Koreans.\" Singapore was North Korea's seventh largest trading partner before it implemented UN resolutions imposed for the North's defiant nuclear and missile programmes of more than a dozen years, cutting trade ties and banning transactions with its banks. Singapore also cancelled the work passes of North Koreans. Singapore was also home to several North Korean-controlled businesses which came under UN investigations for possible sanctions violations. The sanctions remain in place and no firm deals would be struck while that was the case, Heng said.But in the meantime, Singapore business people should get prepared. The trip would focus on specific industries including food, retail, textiles and information and communication technology, he said. \"It is a matter of when the sanctions will be lifted, not if,\" Heng said.\"If we give them a chance, North Korea will definitely open up to the world.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-businesses-eye-opportunities-in-north-korea-in-hope-of-10455876"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 05:29PM", "tags": ["Employment Act", "overtime pay", "employment", "labour rights", "workers"], "author": "Patrick Tay", "title": "Commentary: Tip of the iceberg, when ‘disguised PMEs’ don’t get overtime pay and fair treatment", "content": " SINGAPORE: I recently had a conversation with a relative who started work after completing her Higher NITEC Certificate and for many years worked in the F&B industry. She now works as a restaurant manager, earns about S$2,300 a month and has been in this job for almost eight years now. She shared with me that she has often been recalled back during public holidays, and have had to stay back after work to look into receiving supplies to the restaurant and when repairs to the air-conditioning had to be carried out. I casually asked if she was paid overtime and she answered in the negative. She shared that as recent as 2014, her boss amended her employment contract when they promoted her to a restaurant manager and included terms (such as the power to hire and fire, supervisory and managerial responsibilities) which suggested that she was a PME (Professional, Manager and Executive). As such, they said she was outside the scope of Part IV of the Employment Act which excludes coverage of managers and executives. This meant that she was not entitled to overtime payments for her work in excess of the normal working hours. Is this really a case of a proper classification of a PME? By and large, her job is no different from any of the sales and F&B staff serving customers, save for the responsibilities to ensure the till is correct and the supplies and shop are in order. She may not have a senior management decision-making role at the restaurant as the onus still resides with the restaurant owner. TIP OF THE ICEBERG This is an example of a “disguised PME” scenario in that the worker is a de facto PME. While it is a personal anecdotal example, I am afraid this may just be the tip of the iceberg. Considering we have more than 770,000 individuals in our resident workforce who are PMEs and 1,220,000 who are PMETs (Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians) based on Ministry of Manpower (MOM) figures as at 2017, it is estimated that there are more than 30,000 who are classified as PMEs earning less than S$2,500 per month. We have also seen PMEs in similar situations coming to NTUC for workplace advisory. Although we have not monitored actual numbers, the most recent case was in May this year, involving a union member who works as a site engineer in an IT firm. He earns S$2,000 a month and has been asked to work overtime based on operational needs but was not paid overtime pay in accordance to Part IV of the Employment Act. Instead, his contract stipulates an allowance for work after office hours. We are still in the midst of assisting him in his claim against his employer and we hope to help him get the compensation he deserves. WHO IS AN ‘EXECUTIVE’? A fortnight ago, a High Court case reported saw Justice George Wei noting in the deliberation that “executive position” was not defined in the Employment Act. Black’s Law Dictionary defined “executive” as a “corporate officer at the upper levels of management”. The judge also examined statements made by MOM in Parliament during the recent amendments to the Employment Act to extend coverage to junior managers and executives. In arriving at his decision for this case, he took into account Parliament’s view that managers and executives were persons who were in a better bargaining position, whereas Part IV was meant to protect the more vulnerable employees who were engaged in manual labour or paid lower wages. Justice Wei pointed out the fact that a worker is in a supervisory role does not in itself make him an executive. Such a worker may even be a “workman”. Much would depend on the nature and level of the supervisory powers he is given, alongside other circumstances. In this case, the claimant was in charge of a team and made decisions daily, including conducting toolbox meetings and confirming whether safety requirements were met before work could begin. But the tasks he undertook did not go beyond regular on-site routine administrative work. Even though he had influence over his team members’ appraisals and could provide feedback on their performance, the judge found he did not have direct authority to hire, fire, promote, transfer, reward or discipline them. The judge made it clear that an employee is not a manager or executive merely because he can give feedback and thereby “influence” his superior’s assessment of a team member. In view of all these factors, it was decided that the claimant was not employed in an executive position, was covered under Part IV of the Employment Act and was therefore entitled to overtime payments. IMPACT ON UNIONS AND PME REPRESENTATION Although this recent case touched on who is an executive, it also positively impacts how our unions are better able to represent PMEs. The Industrial Relations Act was amended in April 2015 to give all unions the ability to collectively bargain and represent PMEs across all companies. We have made good progress in extending the scope of representation of PMEs across our unionised companies. However, this recent case is a stark reminder to all employers and human resource leaders to use the terms managers and executives with care and due diligence. Some have been known to wrongly classify their workers to avoid them being represented by unions on the basis that they are in a conflicted position given their managerial and executive powers. More importantly, all workers in any company or business must be aware that they can become union members. All workers can be represented (whether collectively or individually) by unions, save for senior management and selected conflicted roles. REMEDIES, RECOMMENDATIONS The proportion of PMEs have increased and will continue to increase. The proportion of the workforce with specialised qualifications has also increased over time. Qualifications do not guarantee bargaining power as many low-earning employees with specialised qualifications are not deployed to jobs with managerial duties or decision-making powers. I urge all workers whose employers classify them as PMEs, especially those whose monthly salary is lower and below $2,500, to re-examine their employment contract, job role, scope and powers as they may fall within Part IV of the Employment Act and be entitled to overtime payments. Union members can approach their unions, and all workers can seek assistance from the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) or MOM. Tripartite partners can help to better articulate the case law position of who is a PME. Existing web content on MOM’s website on who is a manager and executive may also need to be revised to remove mention of professionals with tertiary education and specialised knowledge as well as provide clear examples of actual managers and executives who earn less than S$2,500 in basic salary. Assessments must be based on the job scope instead of the job title. For manager and executive jobs, they should be in substantive positions of authority, including possessing an authority to hire and fire, being in charge of business units and functions, or directly managing and running the business. Another way around this would be for Part IV of the Employment Act to cover all who earn S$2,500 and below, regardless of whether they are a rank-and-file office worker or a PME. This was something we floated with our tripartite partners in the latest review of the Employment Act. With the exponential growth in PME numbers, I look forward to the day when we will eventually remove this dichotomy between the rank-and-file and PME workers. In the meantime, I hope for greater awareness among workers and employers so that workers are treated fairly, and the wrongful classification of workers as managers and executives is eradicated.

The ministry issued six stop-work orders and 78 composition fines amounting to S$91,000 after inspecting 350 companies in April and May. MOM said in a news release on Thursday (Jun 21) that the lapses were mainly a \"lack of machine guarding\", failure to implement proper procedures during maintenance and repair, and inadequate risk assessment relating to machinery safety.

Director of occupational safety and health inspectorate, Mr Sebastian Tan, said that the construction, metalworking and marine sectors were the three that accounted for most of the machinery-related cases between 2014 and 2017. “The majority of these accidents occurred during the use of electrical hand tools, saws and handling of metal items,” he said. “Employers and supervisors must identify and eliminate machinery risks in their workplaces and proactively communicate the safe use of machinery to workers.” Under the Work Safety and Health Act, companies that fail to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety and health of their workers can be fined up to S$500,000 for the first offence. “MOM will continue to target inspections in the manufacturing, construction and marine sectors, to ensure that employers improve machinery safety and eliminate amputation risks at workplaces,” added Mr Tan.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/276-companies-taken-to-task-for-lapses-in-machinery-safety-10455352"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 04:49PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Yang", "aviation"], "author": "", "title": "Edmund Cheng to replace Lee Hsien Yang as CAAS chairman", "content": " SINGAPORE: There will be a new chairman at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) from Jul 1.

All that's left is the statement of apology posted on Thursday.  Hi everyone,  I didn’t intend to release any statement regarding recent events, largely because I did not know how I could accurately express how sorry I am. But seeing how people are now making baseless and false allegations against those close to me—simply by mere association-- I have decided to confront the facts instead of leaving them subject to speculation. I did not want to let any more people down.  The outrage regarding how I have conducted myself is justified and I accept full responsibility for my actions and all consequences that arise from those actions.  I was wrong to have claimed that stock images and other people’s work were my own. I was also wrong to have used false captions that misled my followers and those who viewed my images. Having marketed myself as a photographer, I fell far short of what was expected of me and disappointed those who believed—or wanted to believe— in me. For all of that, I apologise.  Those close to me disagree with my actions and have asked, whenever they felt that something was not right about my images, that I stop my actions immediately. I did not take their advice seriously and would give reasons that I thought would assuage any concerns they had over those images—just enough so that we would move on to other issues. I let them down with my actions.  I would also like to take the opportunity to clear the air. The end-products of my collaborations with my friends remained honest and fair. Whatever my shortcomings were, I did not bring them to my collaborations. That would not have been fair to those who collaborated with me, and they would not have allowed such practices to be carried out in any event. These people are hard-working professionals and I was hurt to see people make baseless allegations or insinuations against them or question their integrity. They should not be hounded for my errors. To that end, I hope that these baseless allegations or insinuations would stop.  I know I have erred and hope that I will be given the time and space to grow and better myself. For those who have stood by me, I would like to thank you and hope that I will be able to earn such kindness in the future.

The Internet company said during a media briefing that the three plans - Smart, Mega and Xtra - will cost S$35, $55 and $85 a month for 7GB, 12GB and 25GB data, respectively. The 25GB plan for Xtra subscribers will include 2GB roaming data for seven markets, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Philippines and Taiwan, said MyRepublic CEO Malcolm Rodrigues. For existing broadband customers, the company is also dangling incentives for them to sign up, if they haven’t done so. They stand to get 3GB more data for the Smart plan, and 8B more for the Mega and Xtra plans. The mobile plans all come with features like “boundless data”, which will not penalise consumers for busting their data caps with extra charges but will see surfing speeds lowered instead. This was a feature announced when they launched two mobile plans for its existing customer base back in May. MyRepublic’s chief marketing officer Shivendra Singh said during the briefing that this, among other features, are to “ensure we are trustworthy” to the consumer. Unlimited data plans, he elaborated, are “not honest” as they usually come with hidden provisos, but its boundless data plans means “customers don’t need to worry about excess data charges”. Mr Rodrigues also told Channel NewsAsia on the sidelines that based on customer response following the launch of Uno and Ultimate for “friends of MyRepublic”, feedback has been “good”, particularly for those who have busted their data caps and had their surfing speeds managed. “It’s like when we drop from 4G to HSPA today. You probably can’t watch a high-definition video, but you can still do stuff like send WhatsApp messages,” he said. These plans will also have 1,000 minutes of talk time and 1,000 SMS text messages, free local delivery of SIM cards and activation, the company said, adding new customers can sign up from Thursday. Key to the user experience is the MyRepublic mobile app, available for both iOS and Android devices, said Mr Singh. Users will be able to customise their mobile plan, such as signing up for data boosters or roaming packages on the fly, and track their usage from the app. The intention behind its design is for users to do what they need within three clicks in the app, he added. These on-the-go provisioning of services are enabled through the company’s “thick MVNO model”, which it said is first of its kind in Singapore.  CEO Rodrigues said it is a “multimillion-dollar network system” that allows it greater control over the delivery of services to customers compared to traditional MVNO arrangements which sees these operators just resell products from the main telco. This appeared to be similar to rival MVNO Circles.Life’s platform Circles-X. When asked what’s the difference, Mr Singh declined to comment on its competitor’s products. CONSUMERS TO BENEFIT FROM LOOMING COMPETITION Analysts Channel NewsAsia spoke to ahead of the launch on Thursday predicted a period of fierce competition in the local telecoms market, with consumers the main beneficiaries. Mr Shiv Putcha, contributing analyst at IDC, said the Singapore market is not big enough to support four full-fledged telcos and four MVNOs. “At roughly 8.5 million subscriptions, the Singapore market is already over-penetrated,” Mr Putcha said. “We expect a period of fierce competitive intensity and there will be some clear winners and losers, with the incumbents, especially the smaller ones, likely to cede ground and market share.” With the pending entrance of fourth telco TPG Telecom, as well as the introduction of new MVNOs in the past year, consumers will “benefit immensely” from lowered prices, higher data bundles and flexible plans, the analyst said. He also expects to see the telco incumbents - Singtel, StarHub and M1 - make renewed investments on customer experience. Canalys research analyst Nguyen TuanAnh echoed similar thoughts, saying that consumers will benefit from the rise of MVNOs. He pointed to similar developments in Japan last year which suggest that full-fledged telcos, while benefiting from leasing spectrum to MVNOs, will also reduce prices to maintain their subscriber base. These telcos also have more tools than just reducing costs, as they can turn to digital content for growth, the Canalys analyst said For instance, while they may not match MVNOs in attractive price packages, bundling data with content such as free streaming of Spotify or Netflix for example, is a “great way” for them to remain subscribers and improve revenue.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myrepublic-launches-3-mobile-plans-talks-up-customer-focus-10454664"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 12:31PM", "tags": ["Bukit Panjang LRT", "SMRT", "public transport"], "author": "", "title": "Bukit Panjang LRT to resume service on Sundays, but with shorter operating hours", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit (BPLRT) will resume operations on Sundays starting from July, although operating hours will be shortened, announced SMRT on Thursday (Jun 21).

Gallup’s Law and Order Index, which polls residents from 142 countries, is a composite score out of a possible 100 points.  Respondents are polled on their confidence in local police, feelings of personal safety and the incidence of theft, assault or mugging in the past year. For both 2018 and 2017, Singapore topped the chart with 97 out of 100 points. The city state also scored a respectable 93 for the index published in 2016.

At the other end of the index, Venezuela earned the title of “least secure” with 44 points while Afghanistan's score of 45 hit a record low, said Gallup. Only 17 per cent of Venezuelans in 2017 said they felt safe walking alone in their area at night, putting them on equal footing with Afghans (20 per cent). The index also showed that more Venezuelans (42 per cent) reported having property or money stolen in the past year, topping the previous high of 38 per cent set in 2016. Globally, 69 per cent of people said they have confidence in their local police while 68 per cent said they feel safe walking alone at night where they live. “In most economically developed countries with strong rule of law, high majorities of residents say they feel safe walking alone in their areas at night,\" said Gallup. \"This response is nearly universal in Singapore at 94 per cent and tops 80 per cent in many Western European countries.\" Law and Order Index Worldwide:", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-ranked-safest-destination-in-the-world-for-3rd-10454308"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 10:45AM", "tags": ["Immigration and Checkpoints Authority"], "author": "", "title": "Man caught smuggling more than 6,800 sachets of chewing tobacco at Woodlands Checkpoint", "content": " SINGAPORE: A Malaysian man was caught smuggling more than 6,800 sachets of chewing tobacco via Woodlands Checkpoint on Tuesday (Jun 19).  The 35-year-old driver appeared \"nervous and (was) avoiding eye contact\", said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in a Facebook post on Wednesday.  After sensing something was amiss, ICA officers conducted further checks and found the sachets hidden in modified compartments of the car.   The sachets were stuffed under the front passenger floor mat, in the rear boot door as well as in the side doors.  Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is investigating the case, added ICA.  The authority added that it will continue to conduct security checks to prevent smuggling attempts.

But what you get is horrifyingly abysmal – damp sheets, a musty stench in the air and none of the custom amenities you were promised. Although everyone who has been through such an experience tells me vehemently that they have ceased to take reviews into account when making buying decisions, this is still not yet an uncommon story. A recent episode of Talking Point pointed out that the prevalence of fake reviewers has risen in tandem with the online shopping boom. READ: Army of fake reviewers being built to dupe buyers, drive online sales. A 2016 survey by business consultancy PwC showed some 57 per cent of respondents in Singapore used social media to read reviews, compared with 45 per cent globally. While family members and friends have the most impact on buying behaviour, data analytics lecturer Koh Noi Sian from Nanyang Polytechnic said positive online reviews have been found to increase sales by 9 per cent. There would be nothing wrong with any of this if the reviews were authentic. But the programme also found that the proportion of fraudulent positive reviews could be higher than many of us thought. It’s an industry unto itself with one company saying it pays about 80,000 individuals to post such reviews for its clients’ products and services. Most of these individuals are likely to have never tried the products or services. This may not come as a surprise to many who already take such reviews with a pinch of salt. But many others clearly trust, at least until they are sorely disappointed. Thankfully, there are tools these days to help consumers analyse the authenticity of such reviews. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But even these aren’t absolutely accurate and telling real from fake remains challenging. INSIDIOUS ADVERTISING COMES IN MANY FORMS A healthy scepticism is clearly needed here and many would agree that since the early days of advertising, the term “caveat emptor” or “let the buyer beware” applied to every buying decision. But there is something disturbingly insidious about ads made to look like genuine user reviews. Several years ago, when social media influencers came under fire for not clearly marking their sponsored posts as ads, the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS) stepped in with guidelines.   The guidelines on advertising and marketing communication on interactive and social media state that disclosures of commercial relationships and disclaimers should be made prominent, paid reviews, testimonials and endorsements have to be clearly indicated and reviews that are disguised as being from impartial sources are not permitted. Those who fail to comply with the guidelines risk having the ads removed, the withholding of advertising space or time by media owners, or even the withdrawal of trading privileges from advertising agencies. Many have said the penalties could be harsher and consumer protection laws need to have more teeth.  But even then, clearly not every instance of a breach of these guidelines will be detected and acted upon. Some online businesses have been taking steps of their own. In 2016, in its effort to combat fake reviews on its platform, Amazon sued three of its sellers for using fake accounts to post fake reviews about their products. It also used lawsuits to discourage the buying and selling of reviews. But while we often demand that businesses, the authorities and organisations like ASAS and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) protect consumers better, we would certainly benefit from becoming more savvy ourselves. In 2015, we learnt that even negative reviews can be fraudulent. Social media agency Gushcloud was found to have incentivised social media influencers to complain about rival telcos as part of a campaign for Singtel. CONSUMER LITERACY The morass of dubious, solicited and inauthentic reviews could leave a consumer’s head spinning. But just as we have discussed media literacy in the context of detecting and eschewing fake news or deliberate online falsehoods, we need to become more advertising literate. There is evidence of healthy scepticism when it comes to social media marketing. For instance, earlier this year when the Ministry of Finance tapped social media influencers to raise awareness and engagement on Budget 2018, many netizens wondered if the influencers involved had the requisite knowledge or interest to authentically execute the task. However, consumer literacy goes beyond this. READ: Go beyond addressing deliberate online falsehoods to encourage a thinking society , a commentary. READ: A commentary on the use of social media influencers for Budget 2018.  Last year, CASE reported an “alarming rise” in the amount of prepayments reported lost by consumers when businesses closed down. Since then, CASE has been advising consumers to negotiate progressive payments instead of paying in full upfront; to find out if a business offers any insurance or escrow arrangements to protect prepayments; to choose the \"pay as you use\" option instead of prepaid packages; and to always ask about the refund policy for the prepayment. Yet, we have seen similar cases recently involving travel agencies and a furniture store with consumers reporting losses of thousands of dollars. While there might be some legal recourse under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act, recovering lost money can often be impossible. Therefore, we would certainly do well to take precautions before parting with our money offline or online. BUSINESSES BEWARE Businesses also need to learn that consumers will eventually catch on. Operating on the premise that there will be enough of us falling for such tricks online is unsustainable. Reputable businesses would tell you that establishing your brand’s reputation by partnering a real person who is worthy of your target consumers’ trust and who gives a balanced, authentic review is key to retaining and attracting customers. Nothing beats a proven track record. Not even an avalanche of fraudulent reviews. For consumers, thankfully, word-of-mouth through an individual’s own network or family and friends still holds sway. We can all wish to go back to simpler days when this and trial and error were the primary factors that determined our puchasing decisions. But to be realistic, it is wiser to take it upon ourselves to become smarter consumers. It is time to grow up and beware.

In 2008, this was re-configured to 100 business class seats and no premium economy cabin.  It proved a wrong move when the financial crisis hit and business travel demand slumped.  These circumstances combined made the route unprofitable and led the airline to finally pull the plug at the end of 2013.  FAST FORWARD TO THE PRESENT Fast-forward to 2018 and SIA has announced that it will be resuming its Changi-Newark non-stop service – the world’s longest commercial flight – this October, amidst a flurry of similar ultra-long-haul routes being launched by various airlines over the past couple of years.  Some challenges remain. Fuel prices, though lower than the 2013 levels, are on the rise.  According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global jet fuel prices have risen 50.3 per cent year-on-year to US$90.4 per barrel as of Jun 1. Bloomberg data shows that Singapore jet fuel prices are back up at their highest levels since 2014.  Still, a lot has changed and there’s good reason to be optimistic that SIA will succeed. New, fuel-efficient aircraft are improving the viability of ultra-long haul flights. In March this year, Qantas launched their Perth-London service using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.  Singapore Airlines will operate the Airbus A350-900ULR between Singapore and New York, which is expected to deliver considerably better route economics than the A340-500.  NEW CABINS APPEAL TO BUSINESS TRAVELERS The cabin configuration has also changed. SIA’s A350s have been fitted with 67 business class and 94 premium economy seats, compared with the post-2008 A340 configuration which had only business class seats.  The 100 per cent premium seat mix makes sense, since business travelers are a key demographic for non-stop flights – these are the passengers who value a shorter travel time the most, and they’re willing to pay extra for this benefit. The inclusion of premium economy will allow SIA to attract business travelers whose corporate travel policies don’t permit them to fly business class. These flights can drastically reduce airport layovers and unfavourable scheduling. This means companies and their business travelers can make smarter budgeting decisions when comparing the higher ticket cost on an ultra-long-haul flight versus the additional hotel nights that might be necessary on a trip categorised by multi-segment flights.  Seen in this light, companies can potentially reduce their expenditure on employee travel by including ultra-long haul options in their travel programmes. And with better lighting, higher ceilings, and improved air quality, the new aircraft being used on ultra-long-haul routes also provide a more pleasant cabin experience that reduces fatigue and improves productivity and well-being – another big plus for business travelers.  As a result, demand for ultra long-haul flights is growing. The number of such flights has nearly tripled to 19 over the last decade, according to air travel intelligence company OAG.  In particular, they have generated a lot of interest from the business travel community, with many companies including these routes as part of their corporate fare negotiations with airlines.   BENEFITS TO AIR HUBS LIKE SINGAPORE For traditional hub airports like Singapore’s Changi Airport, ultra-long haul flights present both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, we could see their relevance as stopovers disappear when they are not the end-destination in themselves.   The flipside is that business travel originating in Singapore and similar hub markets could see tremendous benefits – for example, the ability to reach both coasts of the United States from Singapore in one flight can drive business to the major airlines servicing the hubs, and thus bring greater passenger footfall to the airports.  Changi Airport’s investment in its infrastructure looks smart in this context, and the focus it has placed on traveler experience and the swift entry and exit from the airport will likely be a major point of differentiation.  Vibhav Singh is senior consultant at CWT Solutions Group, the consulting arm of travel management company Carlson Wagonlit Travel.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-airlines-sia-new-york-world-longest-commercial-flight-10447302"}, {"datetime": "21 Jun 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["Scams", "Singapore Police Force"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'All I wanted was to help save a life': Getting swindled in Singapore an expensive lesson for some", "content": " SINGAPORE: When Mary (not her real name) received a Facebook friend request last November from a businessman who appeared to have some acquaintances in common, she thought nothing of accepting the invitation. That marked the start of a dizzying web of deceit which ultimately saw her lose at least S$200,000 within two months. Claiming to be a businessman based in the Middle East, Mary’s new “friend” would send her WhatsApp messages embellished with details of his family and photographs of him with associates. “He seemed very pleasant-looking and well-dressed,” Mary told Channel NewsAsia in a phone interview. “I thought that he was too high-profile for me.” But within a month of them getting to know each other, the man was asking for a loan to cover “customs taxes”, as the machinery parts for his oil business was stuck at customs in Dubai. As proof of his identity, he sent Mary a photograph of his passport details.  “It sounded credible, that’s why I gave him that first loan,” she added.  But things escalated days later when the man sent a photo of himself on a stretcher, with an oxygen mask attached to his face. Claiming that he had blacked out and woken up in hospital, the man said he needed medical treatment and could not foot the bill as his assets were frozen by the bank. While her instincts told her that this could be a scam, Mary was convinced by fake doctors’ reports and photographs of the man, who looked gaunt and sickly. “My heart really sank (when I saw the photographs), what if it was real?” she said. But Mary ponying up the cash wasn’t enough, as the man claimed doctors still needed to perform an emergency procedure to save his life. With her savings running low, Mary approached well-meaning friends to raise funds, one of whom contacted the hospital and found out there was no such patient. “At the start, he was very nice,” said Mary. “But the tone in his messages changed. He asked me why I had got my friend involved and that I should be listening to him instead.” With time running out on the scam, the man tried to turn Mary into a money mule, fishing for her bank account and passport details so that he could transfer cash from “clients” to his boss in Dubai through her, in order to pay for the operation.  Mary said: “When he asked for passport details, it was like a flashing red light.” She stopped responding to the man’s messages before making a police report. “The police officer told me there was nothing much they could do about it,” added Mary. “Sometimes I ask God why me? I never hurt anybody. All I wanted to do was help save a life and it turned out to be a painful and costly experience.” PREYING ON PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS Mary is not alone. According to the Singapore Police Force, at least S$99 million was lost to scammers last year.  Internet love scams, in particular, hit a new high of 825 in 2017, with cases increasing by 30 per cent. To combat this, the police last October formed the Transnational Commercial Crime Task Force (TCTF) to investigate these particular scams. The police also work closely with foreign law enforcement counterparts to crack down on overseas syndicates targeting Singaporeans. Despite the number of cases decreasing by 8.5 per cent from January to March 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, the SPF said such scams \"remain a concern\". This year, apart from love scams, some of the most common scams include e-commerce and investment ruses, with the police seeing the number of cases increase by 46 per cent and 43.3 per cent respectively. According to Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical Centre, scammers have identified certain “gaps” in the thinking processes of victims and exploit these opportunities. “We rely very much on what we believe in, our preconceived notions and what we see and hear. Sometimes, that in itself may not be entirely accurate and it can be exploited, ” said Dr Lim.  “(In the case of love scams), scammers try to understand you and your needs, they then play to your needs … There’s a deception that is ongoing and then the individual believes this deception, assumes it to be true and complies ultimately with the act of giving up his or her money because of the emotional aspects of it – they feel very bonded to the person online and don’t want to lose them,” he elaborated. “It’s worth noting that there have been cheats and grifters for as long as people have had possessions,” added associate professor Benjamin Detenber from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University. “What networked computers have done is simply extend the reach of cheats and grifters. That is, they have the capability of reaching more ‘marks’ at little or no cost. In the past, con artists had to work the ground, and now they can simply ride a keyboard,” added Prof Detenber, who has research interests in computer-mediated communications. Having received a Facebook friend request from a scammer using the duplicate account of a church mate, John (not his real name) accepted the invitation without much thought. His “friend” claimed to be at an exhibition, and requested for John’s phone number and resultant OTP in order to “claim a prize\". “I totally bought the whole thing. I didn’t really suspect (it was a scam) also because I was studying at the same time,” said John. While the transactions made by the scammer ultimately fell through, several others from John’s church also fell prey to the scam and ended up being charged small amounts through their phone bill. “It is taking advantage of the friendships and the goodwill of people,” added John. “I was quite disgusted that they would make use of the trust that you have for close friends.” STEERING CLEAR OF THE LAW But it is not merely about being trusting. Singaporeans are also less likely to question authority, making them more susceptible to scams, added Dr Lim. “I do think that Singaporeans are more likely to be scammed than (those who come from) other countries,\" noted Dr Lim. “We are less likely to question authority - we are a more trusting society and less questioning especially when it comes to authority … In Singapore, we are so averse to having some sort of criminal record, some sort of brushes with the law or a black mark on our life, we are very likely to then fall victim and then pay up.” A victim of an impersonation scam, Andrea was coerced into divulging credit card information. She was contacted by a caller purporting to be from a service center who informed her that she had a package due for collection. But because the package contained an illegal substance, she had to transfer her to a \"police\" hotline. “When you look back on it, it seems ridiculous. You’re simply too involved in the conversation to think clearly,” said Andrea. “I thought that being scammed was something that would never happen to me.” Flustered and worried after being transferred from caller to caller for more than an hour, Andrea was informed that she was also wanted in a corruption case, and told to provide her bank and credit card details. While she provided the latter, she could not get her banking information online and headed to her bank to get the information in person. “It was while walking there that I came to my senses,” she said. “I thought of what they were telling me, checked the internet and realised it was a scam.” Andrea reported the case to the police straight after, and immediately cancelled all her credit cards to ensure that no money was withdrawn. “We don’t concentrate very well and we don’t make good judgments when we are under time pressure, or stress,” said Dr Lim. “During those times, the anxiety is very high. The brain is trying to find a way to let go of the anxiety so people would rather give up on rationalising the situation.\" \"The police strongly urge the public to be cautious when making any form of online transactions and to exercise due vigilance when making friends over the Internet,\" SPF said in a statement. \"Do not give out personal information and bank details, ATM cards, PIN codes, Internet banking tokens to strangers. No government agency will ask for payment or seek banking information over the telephone. Victims should remember: Don’t panic, don’t believe, don’t give.\" “Before I received that call, I never really thought twice about scams,” said Andrea. “I was so frightened and scared. You think that Singapore is so secure and safe but it is not always the case.

But with Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) president Tan Chuan-Jin watching in the stands, the Young Lions were unable to match Myanmar, who included just one player from the side that competed at the U-20 World Cup in 2015.  The rest of the Myanmar team were made up of players aged 20 and below, according to their head coach Myo Hlaing Win. In comparison, about half the Singapore U-23 team are aged 21 and below.  Singapore U-23 head coach Fandi Ahmad admitted that he could \"see the difference\" between both teams, explaining that his team had a lack of preparation. The team had only one training session together before playing the game because of the players' exertions in the Singapore Premier League. Fandi cannot confirm if the Football Association of Singapore will be continuing with their appeal to SNOC for the U-23 team to make the Singapore contingent. \"It's beyond my control and not my decision (with regard to the appeal). We hope it can spur the boys to do better in the future,\" said Fandi.  \"Actually, we (the coaches) never thought about the Asian Games. We just wanted to give an opportunity to the players. Obviously we are disappointed to lose ... (but) we are happy to get a chance to play.\"  Fandi certainly did give opportunities to the players - 22 of the 23 took to the pitch against Myanmar - and said he was impressed with some of their performances, although he lamented the fact that the team were missing three key players in Ikhsan Fandi, Adam Swandi and Taufiq Muqminin.  He added that Mr Tan, who also chairs the SNOC Selection Committee for the Asian Games, told the team after the game that \"he was quite happy\" with what he saw.  \"He saw the commitment, he said it was a good sign and he want us to improve,\" said Fandi.  MORE FRIENDLIES BEING ARRANGED FOR THE TEAM  Plans are in the pipeline for the team to play more friendly games, Fandi revealed to reporters at the post-match press conference.  The team will be taking on Macau on Jun 27, as well as play a triangular tournament featuring Australian club sides Perth Glory and Wellington Phoenix in Singapore on Aug 4.  \"This is how we want to develop the players. A majority were playing in the Prime League last year ... we need more matches like this.

From Aug 13 at 8am, PayNow Corporate will let businesses and government agencies pay and receive Singapore dollar funds \"instantaneously\", the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) said in a media release on Wednesday (Jun 20). The service will allow companies and government agencies who are the corporate customers of seven banks - Citibank, DBS Bank/POSB, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank - to transfer and receive Singapore dollar funds instantaneously with the use of their bank’s mobile app. Organisations which sign up for PayNow Corporate will have their Unique Entity Number linked to their Singapore bank account. A QR code will also be generated for both individual and corporate users of PayNow when the new service rolls out. The PayNow QR Code will be part of the Singapore QR (SG QR) code, which will take effect in the second half of 2018. Individual customers of the Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China who have registered with PayNow will also be able to use the QR code to transfer funds, but not their corporate customers. In a media briefing on Wednesday, ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon said that PayNow Corporate “takes away the need to know the bank account number\". According to Mrs Ong, more than a million people in Singapore are using PayNow and more than S$900 million has been transferred through the service since its launch last July. Education Minister and Monetary Authority of Singapore board member Ong Ye Kung announced the launch of PayNow Corporate on Wednesday at the 45th annual dinner of ABS. He said that consumers would simply need to scan the QR code of the company they are transacting with, using the mobile payment app on their smartphones to transfer money from their own accounts to the company’s bank account. The transaction can also go the other way, where businesses and organisations can make mass disbursement to individuals through their mobile phone or identification numbers. “There are various possible applications, such as salary crediting, insurance payouts, or giving out awards,” he added. Mr Ong gave the example of how the Ministry of Education disbursed Edusave Award funds to students via PayNow earlier this year. \"CASH IS ALWAYS HARD TO HANDLE\" For business owners like Mr Kelvin Ngian, PayNow Corporate aims to make transactions smoother as the number of cheques his company has to collect will be reduced. A lot of man hours are spent tallying cheques and cash payments against bank statements, said the general manager of Siam Coconut, a Thai coconut wholesaler. “For those pop-up events, instead of spending a lot of money on a merchant terminal, we can actually leverage the PayNow system with QR code to enable us to collect cash much easier,” he said. “Cash is always hard to handle.” According to ABS, the participating banks will release a mobile application for its corporate customers on Aug 13 so that it is more convenient for companies to make fund transfers via PayNow. While acknowledging the benefits that PayNow Corporate can give to his company, Mr Kelvyn Chee, the managing director of retail company Decks, said he had some concerns. “We are afraid … there's more transactions in our bank statement. Actually our staff have more work to do in terms of workload. The other thing is, we are afraid of (a) security breach,” he said. The amount he has to pay to the bank to be a corporate PayNow user will also be another factor in deciding whether to adopt the new service. Several banks that Channel NewsAsia approached declined to reveal the amount they will charge their corporate customers. The extension of PayNow to businesses is part of a nationwide drive to go cashless, and follows the launch of PayNow for peer-to-peer fund transfers last year.   But Mr Ong highlighted that some Singaporeans are confused by the wide variety of payment options in the country. The decision to have such a wide variety is deliberate, according to Mr Ong. “Having one or two players dominate the market brings short term convenience to consumers, but in the context of Singapore, there will be significant downside risk in the long term due to a lack of competition,” he said. The lack of competition will slow down the rate of innovation and lead to the risk of unfair pricing for consumers, he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/business-government-paynow-corporate-transfer-money-10452774"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 10:36PM", "tags": ["e-payment", "digital payments", "banking"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore should aim to be cheque-free by 2025: Ong Ye Kung", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore should aim to \"eliminate cheques\" by 2025 as the nation works towards a more widespread use of e-payments, said Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday (Jun 20). Mr Ong was speaking at the Association of Banks in Singapore's annual dinner where he stressed that while Singapore does not need to be an entirely cashless society, it should aim to \"use less cash and more e-payments\". \"The aim is not to force a cashless society, but to enable everyone to enjoy the convenience and efficiency of e-payments – simple, swift, safe and seamless,\" he said. He added that the take-up rate for cashless payment methods like PayNow has been good and \"promising\" as consumers are \"increasingly favouring\" e-payments. \"More than eight in 10 Singapore consumers have adopted e-payments and almost three in five Singapore merchants are accepting e-payments,\" he said. \"The use of cash and cheques has been coming down steadily in recent years.\" He added that everyone should be able to \"enjoy the convenience and efficiency of e-payments\" as he outlined ways to enable this.  EXTENDING PAYNOW'S USAGE TO BUSINESSES  In order to achieve this, the banking industry will extend PayNow to businesses, as well as customers.  Businesses will be able to link their Unique Entity Number (UEN) to their bank accounts so that payments can be made even without the firm's bank account number. PayNow's usage will also be expanded to include \"mass disbursements\" to individuals or business-to-consumer payments using just their mobile numbers or NRIC numbers. This would include Edusave Award money and CPF payouts. This was tested out earlier this year when the Ministry of Education piloted the disbursement of Edusave Award money to students via PayNow. \"Shortly after recipients received their certificates on the stage, they got SMSes notifying them that the award money has been credited into their bank accounts,\" Mr Ong explained. Since March this year, eligible CPF members over the age of 55 could also receive their lump sum withdrawals through PayNow. Mr Ong also addressed several concerns about e-payments, including security. He noted that the Monetary Authority of Singapore will be introducing a new bill later this year to \"strengthen the standards of consumer protection\" and protect consumers against other forms of crime related to e-payments.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-should-aim-to-be-cheque-free-by-2025-ong-ye-kung-10452570"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 07:58PM", "tags": ["crime", "wildlife"], "author": "", "title": "Man fined S$3,500 for importing a live tortoise", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 40-year-old man was fined S$3,500 on Wednesday (Jun 20) for the illegal importation of a Greek tortoise into Singapore.

But a local urban farm has managed to do just that - growing strawberries, with the help of technology in a controlled hydroponics environment. \"We manipulate the environment to enhance the flavour profiles of our products, even down to the nutrients that run in the water,\" said Benjamin Swan, co-founder of Sustenir Agriculture.  \"So even though it took two months to get the (strawberries) up, we spent the better part of six months understanding how we can best optimise the growth footprints we have to make the products the best we can be ... by controlling the environment.\" Strawberries are the latest fruits of the vertical farm's labour, with other temperate produce in its basket including kale and arugula. The vertical farm also has plans to explore innovations in agriculture, by setting up a research and development lab in startup complex JTC LaunchPad @ one-north. In a visit to the 1,000 sq ft facility on Wednesday (Jun 20), Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon said the Government would continue supporting urban farmers in co-developing solutions with industry players, in light of challenges faced by the urban farmers. \"The industry gave feedback that they have two challenges. One is that there is a lack of plug-and-play, cost-effective solutions for automation they can use quite quickly,\" said Dr Koh. \"The second challenge they face is that they may need to have more understanding of science of certain niche crop types they can grow in an indoor environment.\" \"Urban farming as a movement is still fairly new globally. Therefore some of these solutions may not be readily available off the shelf,\" Dr Koh said. \"But we do see a lot of solution providers innovating solutions that can be adoptable.\" \"They being here in LaunchPad – where a lot of innovation and entrepreneurs are – this can be a place to catalyse cocreation of solutions. And I think that would not just meet needs, but create an entirely new pillar of exportable technology for our local companies as well,\" Dr Koh said.  He cited the example of Sustenir Agriculture, which partnered with robotic solutions company PBA Hanhwa Robotics to devise a robotic arm for its seeding and transplanting process. Dr Koh added that the Government would continue to encourage collaboration between farmers and institutes of higher learning. \"The NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI) is already working with some of our industry to better understand the science behind growing niche crop varieties, and to look at agrotech they can co-develop together to meet those challenges.\" The vertical farm, which is expanding into Hong Kong in the third quarter of 2018, is also looking at growing \"indoor grapes\" – and eventually even harvesting \"made in Singapore\" wine among others. \"All strawberries need to be pollinated – typically that happens with bees outdoors,\" said Mr Swan. \"What we do right now is that we do it by hand with a forensic brush. It’s a little bit laborious and we don’t get 100 per cent success.

It was in a display plaque which read: \"Singapore's first diamond-embellished UOB Reserve metal card ... for those who value exclusivity in it's (sic) most extinguished form.\" In response to Channel NewsAsia's queries, UOB confirmed that the plaque - with the photographed wording - was displayed at a customer event on Tuesday night to showcase the card. \"The promotional text that was printed only for a table display at a private event last night had been overlooked during our clearance process,\" said Ms Choo Wan Sim, UOB's head of Cards and Payments Singapore. \"We are sorry and will not let this happen again.\" Commenting on Mr Price's Facebook post, netizens were quick to laugh at the plaque's use of the word \"extinguished\". \"Now the person who received it must be on fire and needs to be extinguished,\" commented Joyce Lee. \"Gosh hilarious.\" \"Perhaps they're trying to tell you to extinguish the card by burning it down to carbon ...

The new uniform is made up of the usual Number 4 uniform pixelated fabric and a high-performance fabric, which comprises a combination of flame resistant synthetic materials and aramid, a type of fibre that is strong and heat-resistant.  It is designed to be worn under the integrated load bearing vest during combat exercises and outfield activities. Soldiers will still be required to wear the Number 4 uniform for other routine activities. \"What this means is that when our soldiers wear the load bearing vest, they will sustain better and endure longer in a combat environment,\" head of the Centre of Excellence for Soldier Performance (CESP) Senior Lieutenant Colonel Yee Kok Meng said on Tuesday (Jun 19). The new uniform was unveiled as Chief of Defence Force Major-General Melvyn Ong said the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was committed to equipping its solders with better equipment, like a new load bearing vest that dissipates heat better. \"All these we are doing to support the individual, and the CESP will also, especially in the area of heat injuries, get behind it,\" he added. FEATURES The hybrid uniform's high-performance fabric has a porous construction that allows for better air circulation, meaning it is 1.4 times as permeable as the Number 4 uniform. It also absorbs perspiration quickly and is 1.6 times as effective in drying. The fabric is also fire-resistant and comes with \"self-extinguishing abilities\". \"Hence, it does not melt or drip when exposed to extreme heat,\" the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said. The new uniform began rolling out in January to soldiers from the Army combat units, chosen for their physically-demanding missions, with equipping to be completed by the end of this year. Each soldier will receive two pieces of the uniform. Infantry units like 3rd and 6th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (SIR) have been fully equipped with the uniform. Full-time national serviceman Private (PTE) Kugan Senivasan, a 4 SIR trooper, said he feels a “genuine difference” wearing the hybrid uniform during strenuous training. “When you’re doing exercises, the Number 4 uniform drags on your body a lot, whereas this is rather smooth and comfortable,\" the 18-year-old said. The uniform will also come in handy during outfield exercises, when soldiers have \"sweat and camouflage dripping down\" their faces, PTE Kugan added. However, MINDEF said there are no plans to distribute the new uniform to operationally-ready national servicemen during In-Camp Training as the Number 4 uniform still meets their training requirements. \"Servicemen will be able to replace their hybrid uniform at eMart outlets via credit or cash,\" MINDEF said. \"Stock is still being built up progressively for retail at eMart outlets.\" A HISTORY OF UNIFORMS The hybrid uniform was conceptualised in 2011 for the Army and has undergone \"extensive\" trials, with input from agencies like the Defence Science Technology Agency (DSTA) and ST Logistics, MINDEF said. \"Various agencies worked together in the acquisition process, from crafting of technical specification to ensuring the quality of the final product fulfills our requirements,\" it added. The last major change to the Army Number 4 uniform took place in 2008, when the current pixelated design replaced its more jungle-oriented, camouflage predecessor. Back then, a need to optimise the performance of 3rd Generation SAF soldiers in both urban and forested terrains had emerged. Extensive DSTA research had revealed that the new pixelised pattern helps to generate a \"quivering\" effect that reduces the eye's ability to discern recognisable shapes, defence magazine CyberPioneer reported. \"It's safe to say we're looking at a 30 to 50 per cent enhancement in the soldier's camouflage capability,\" then-Chief of Staff, HQ 9 Division/Infantry, Colonel Tan Chor Kiat had said. Besides the new design and features like frontal epaulettes, the pixelated uniform also enabled better air flow and heat dissipation, drying two times faster than the old uniform. CAMOUFLAGE AND TEMASEK GREEN Moving further back in time, the old camouflage design, influenced by the American-developed camouflage cloth, was introduced in 1983. \"With the continuing Rambo series keeping the camo look in the forefront, the uniform became so fashionable that the SAF had to remind fashionistas that to wear it casually was an offence under the Decorations and Uniforms Act,\" one Hayden Ng wrote in a MINDEF article commemorating SAF50. Its predecessor, the first generation Temasek Green SAF combat uniform, debuted for the Army, Navy and Air Force in 1967. \"Made of thick cotton, the shirt had to be tucked in,\" Mr Ng wrote. \"And although it was fashionably slim cut for the sixties, it was not particularly practical to serve double duty as a parade uniform and for field training.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saf-army-combat-soldiers-new-uniforms-cool-dry-faster-10451190"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 04:59PM", "tags": ["Dining", "Michelin Star"], "author": "Genevieve Sarah Loh", "title": "Do Michelin stars really matter in Singapore’s fine-dining scene?", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos SINGAPORE: With 10 days to go, the countdown to the closure of Joel Robuchon’s restaurants has begun. Once service ends on Jun 30, the lauded French chef’s namesake restaurant and sister outlet L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon at Resorts World Sentosa will bid adieu, along with their three and two Michelin stars, respectively. This comes at the heels of the shuttering of the two-Michelin-starred Restaurant Andre, which closed earlier this year after chef-owner Andre Chiang decided to return to Taiwan. These two huge exits have collectively caused quite a stir, not least because of their literally stellar status (“No more three-starred restaurant in Singapore? What now?”). And with this year’s Michelin Guide set to come out on Jul 25, we wondered: Are those stars really that big a deal for our local fine-dining scene? REACHING FOR THE STARS It’s been a mixed bag of responses from the people CNA Lifestyle interviewed. While reaching for that star isn’t an end goal for a restaurant like Odette – which has two – having one helps a lot. “Awards like Michelin have always been a great means of growing international recognition for a restaurant,” said Wee Teng Wen, managing partner of The Lo & Behold Group that includes Odette. The Michelin Guide also has an impact on the places it’s at. While Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore already have longstanding reputations as food havens, one can’t deny the additional buzz that surrounded these places once the Guides came in – a kind of extra atas sheen, if you will. But others have pointed out that the Michelin star doesn’t mean that much anymore. “The shine of the Michelin star is no longer what it used to be. Especially outside of France,” said a restaurateur, who doesn’t want to be named. He pointed out that many in Asia have been left “dumbfounded” by many of the Michelin Guide’s decisions in the region. “Japanese chefs were offended that foreigners, who have no sense of their culture and cuisine, suddenly became their judges. The Hong Kong stars, in particular, have been criticised by many. “In Singapore, specific hawkers have been recognised and others who are equally good if not better are completely left out,” he shared candidly.“The guide also seems to favour certain chefs who can do no wrong, and those they seem to have a prior relationship with.” STAR BRIGHT OR STAR LITE?  Having that star also puts a strain on businesses. Another chef-restaurateur, who would only speak on the condition of anonymity, pointed out the dangers of landlords imposing higher rents in these starred institutions. He added: “Restaurants are known to renovate, change entire menus, hire sommeliers and pay former inspectors a lot of money to learn how to earn a star.” And then, of course, there’s the effect on us, the diners. “Once the stars are awarded, restaurants are known to increase their prices. It is only natural that restaurants will milk the star for what it is worth,” he said. While the unnamed restaurateur said he recognises how the stars pull in the crowd for the lucky ones, it does come at a cost on a bigger scale. “Entire cities of restaurants and chefs are brought to their knees by an organisation that doesn’t even cook. That makes this organisation very powerful.” It’s a sentiment that’s not new – the Michelin Guide has its critics that include the likes of Marco Pierre White (who, at 33, became the world's youngest chef to be awarded three Michelin stars) and the late Anthony Bourdain. The former has once been quoted as saying “the people giving out those stars have less knowledge than the individual behind the stove”. Meanwhile, the much-missed Bourdain considered Michelin's \"principal enterprise\" as \"keeping itself in business and maintaining relevance, assuring another 10 years of chefs kissing its a**.” CAN WE JUST SIT DOWN AND EAT? And yet, despite such criticisms from these big guns, not a lot of industry folk in Singapore are actually willing to talk about such things openly, as was the case for this story. It would seem the Michelin Guide and its stars continue to have quite an impact here, as in many other countries. While the debate on the importance of Michelin stars continues, some food experts maintain a more even-handed perspective of things – that at the end of the day, it really is just about the food. Local chef-owner of Wild Rocket group Willin Low doesn’t think a country’s fine-dining industry’s status should be dependent on any guide or list. “If the country has a vibrant fine-dining scene, its status will naturally be recognised,” he opined, before adding: “It’s also a matter of market demands. If the market needs a certain kind of restaurant scene, it will be met by market forces.” Singapore hawker food champion and Makansutra founder KF Seetoh agrees with Low. “No stars does not mean no hope. We were and are still fine without Michelin-starred restaurants,” he said, adding that Singaporeans are “blind” when it comes to good food. “They won't recognise signboards nor notice the chefs. It's all about the food, the pleasure and the price,” he said. “Reviews on and offline never tell you the restaurant is good because they have stars. It’s good because it just is.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/michelin-restaurants-singapore-joel-robuchon-fine-dining-10443204"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 04:16PM", "tags": ["COE", "transport"], "author": "", "title": "COE premiums for cars fall to lowest since 2010", "content": " SINGAPORE: Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for larger cars fell to the lowest in more than eight years, down to S$33,900 in the latest bidding exercise on Wednesday (Jun 20) from S$36,000 previously.

Lim Wen Bin Stanley, 33, drove from his home in Bukit Panjang to Bukit Batok Swimming Complex for an evening swimming lesson on May 26 last year. He had consumed some alcohol before driving, the court heard. While turning right onto Dairy Farm Road from Petir Road, he lost control of his vehicle and mounted the kerb at the centre divider. He continued driving, colliding into a car and a motorcycle in front of it. The impact caused another motorcycle to topple over. Lim did not stop to help the four victims - the driver of the car he hit, the riders of both motorcycles and the pillion of the toppled bike. Instead, he drove off, beating a red light and driving against traffic. VICTIM TRIED TO PURSUE HIM ON FOOT An eyewitness, Mr Abdul Rahim Mohd Sultan, saw the accident unfold. After the accident, Lim drove against the flow of traffic, with one of the victims chasing after him on foot. The eyewitness followed Lim in his vehicle and found him with his car at the end of Chestnut Avenue. Lim was taken to a traffic police station and failed a breathalyser test, in which he registered a reading of 82mg of alcohol per 100ml of his breath, exceeding the limit of 35mg per 100ml. Lim was convicted for the offences of drink driving, rash driving and failing to render assistance by district court judge Kessler Soh.

In the first incident in August 2016, police officers approached Sivakandesh at Northpoint City shopping mall in Yishun after they received information that he was armed with a stun gun. He dropped it on a grass patch as the officers walked towards him. When asked twice for his particulars, Sivakandesh walked away. When a police officer followed him, Sivakandesh ran. The officer gave chase and managed to stop him, but Sivakandesh struggled. Before the officer could detain him, he hit the policeman's nose with his palm. Two months later, while he was on court bail, he was arrested at Hotel Rendezvous in Bras Basah for suspected criminal activities. In the police car on the way to the Police Cantonment Complex, Sivakandesh hurled vulgarities at the police officer sitting beside him and spat at his face. THEFT IN YISHUN CAR PARK In January last year, Sivakandesh continued his string of offences while still on court bail. He stole a purse containing about S$90 and sunglasses worth about S$150 from an unlocked Mercedes Benz at a car park at Block 624, Yishun Ring Road.  Before that, police had received information of public disturbance at the block. While he was still in the car, police officers who chanced upon him behaving suspiciously and asked for his particulars. He produced a name card of the car owner, and an expired passport belonging to someone else. Again, he struggled while officers tried to arrest him, but they managed to handcuff him. While continuing to struggle, he tried to use a stun gun he had ordered online on a police officer near him. The officer moved away and disarmed him. A flick knife with an 8.5cm blade was also found on him. HISTORY OF VIOLENCE-RELATED OFFENCES Sivakandesh was first sentenced to 15 months’ probation in 2008 for a public nuisance offence. In 2012, he was sentenced to reformative training after pleading guilty to violence-related offences including rioting and causing hurt. He was released in November 2014, but within two weeks, he committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means. He was sentenced to two years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane, and released from prison in July 2016. On Wednesday, he was sentenced on seven charges. Another six were taken into consideration. Corrective training is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. Sivakandesh’s lawyer had asked for his client to be jailed a maximum of three years and two months, fined S$5,000 and given six strokes of the cane. For voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, Sivakandesh could have been jailed up to seven years, fined, caned, or given any combination of punishments. For possessing the flick knife, he could have been jailed between two and eight years, and given at least six strokes of the cane. For importing the stun gun, he could have been fined up to S$10,000 and jailed a maximum of three years.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-tried-use-stun-gun-police-corrective-training-caning-fine-10450758"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 01:00PM", "tags": ["soldier performance", "SAF", "MINDEF"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Less than a year in, SAF soldier performance centre already reducing injury rates", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) soldier performance centre has shown tangible results in reducing injury rates, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on Tuesday (Jun 19). The Centre of Excellence for Soldier Performance (CESP), launched last December, uses science to boost soldiers’ performance and help them realise their full combat potential. “In the seven units where pre-habilitation in the form of Vocation Fitness Training (VFT) and Rehabilitation at Unit (Rehab@Unit) were implemented, preliminary data show an approximate reduction of 30 per cent in soldier musculoskeletal injury rates,” MINDEF said. The seven units refer to the five infantry and two Guards units, while the VFT and Rehab@Unit are two components of the CESP. Chief of Defence Force Major-General (MG) Melvyn Ong said the CESP is in line with his vision of a “dynamic” SAF. MG Ong, who took the helm barely three months ago, was speaking in one of his first media interviews ahead of SAF Day on Jul 1. “In terms of dynamic, because of the technologies that are coming online, we need to always be able to adapt,” he said. “CESP is meant to allow us to put the science into training, so that when we actually put you out there, we don’t just throw you in the deep end, but we prepare you for what you need to do for your task.” VOCATION FITNESS TRAINING One way the CESP prepares soldiers for specific tasks is through VFT, a new four-week training phase introduced after Basic Military Training to strengthen soldiers in vocation-specific combat fitness. The VFT comprises four aspects: physical training like weightlifting, functional training like high-intensity intervals, combat training like casualty drags, and active recovery like aquatics. “Don’t give up on CDF!”: Chief of Defence Force (CDF) Major-General Melvyn Ong taking part in casualty drag drills as part of an infantry unit’s new #SAF vocation fitness training: https://t.co/5FvnBKfDHt pic.twitter.com/Shj4oQyel9 For infantry soldiers who are required to walk long distances, their VFT involves drills that strengthen the lower back. For artillery soldiers that need to load heavy rounds, their VFT focuses on the upper body. The CESP has implemented VFT for all Army combat units, and will complete implementation in combat support units, like the combat engineer and artillery units, by the end of this year. All said, the VFT has shown results. According to qualitative data, soldiers who have taken part are showing 30 per cent more muscles in the right places, while deadlift capacity has also increased by 20 per cent. Full-time national serviceman Private (PTE) Kugan Senivasan, a trooper with the 4th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment, said the VFT helps “a lot in our infantry life”. “VFT makes sure we actually use what we will be using for outfield,” the 18-year-old said after completing his virgin VFT circuit, which involved the lifting of field packs. “A lot of the exercises are catered to it.” While PTE Kugan admitted he found the VFT challenging as it was the “most rigorous” form of training he’s had so far, he said its progressive and repetitive nature means it will eventually have “no kick”. The VFT is also combined with dedicated recovery periods for soldiers so they perform their best during peak phases of unit training. “The Vocation Fitness Training aims to better prepare our soldiers for subsequent combat training,” CESP head Senior Lieutenant Colonel (SLTC) Yee Kok Meng said. “Knowing the statistics, which is mostly back, knee and ankle injuries, we want to prepare them to minimise injury further on in their training system.” According to MINDEF, studies show the three injuries form approximately 70 per cent of all musculoskeletal injuries sustained in SAF soldiers. REHABILITATION AT UNIT Rehab@Unit has also changed how soldiers recover from musculoskeletal injuries. Unit commanders are taught how to recognise early signs of an injury, while the unit medical officer has “better access” to an SAF physiotherapist who can quickly assess the severity of an injury and initiate treatment. “In addition, the SAF physiotherapist makes a monthly routine visit to the units,” MINDEF said. “This reduces waiting time for clinic referrals and injury diagnosis.” The CESP has also provided rehab skills training for unit commanders, who can now support injured soldiers during rehabilitation. “The current soldier-centric approach ensures the most efficient recovery for soldiers and is better able to prevent injury escalation and allow soldiers to return to training with reduced downtime, as compared to our past model of de-centralised care at diverse hospital rehabilitation clinics,” MINDEF explained. Using real-life case studies to highlight the impact of Rehab@Unit, SLTC Yee said an infantry soldier who sustained a nerve injury that affected his shoulder muscles had his rehab time halved to three months. This is because the soldier regularly participated in rehab sessions and learnt injury prevention techniques to avoid recurrence, SLTC Yee added. Previously, he could have been temporarily downgraded for six to 12 months. WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY Beyond managing injuries better, the CESP is also trying to improve soldier performance through the use of wearable technology. The technology can monitor parameters like pulse rates, skin temperatures and sleep activity, information which could be harnessed to develop progressive training programmes for individual soldiers. To that end, the CESP will monitor and consolidate individual parameters over time to provide a better indication of the physiological strain a soldier undergoes during training. With this information, the CESP can track training intensities and volume to reduce the risk of injury from over-training. As for training safety, the information can also provide lead indicators for health hazards like fatigue and elevated body temperatures, allowing the SAF to intervene early and manage injury risks proactively. “CESP is also exploring the feasibility of developing real-time monitoring systems, which applies data analytics to provide real-time alerts that will help commanders detect soldiers in distress and initiate an appropriate response,” MINDEF said. While SLTC Yee acknowledged that real-time monitoring is not possible yet, he said it will become a reality as more data is gathered to determine safety benchmarks. “When soldiers get injured, we can look back at the data and figure out where the training wasn't so good,” he added. “So with all this data, we can better fine-tune our training systems in a customised and safe manner.” Starting about two months from now, 150 cadets from the Officer Cadet School will be the first to embark on a six-month trial of a wearable technology prototype, which is likely to be worn on the arm. “SAF will then evaluate the extent and modality of implementation in its subsequent phase,” MINDEF said. HYBRID UNIFORM Still on the theme of improving soldier performance, the SAF also unveiled a new hybrid uniform that offers better comfort and heat dissipation. It is made up of the usual Number 4 uniform pixelated fabric and a high-performance fabric, which comprises a combination of flame resistant synthetic materials and aramid. The uniform was conceptualised in 2011 for the Army and has undergone \"extensive\" trials, with input from agencies like the Defence Science Technology Agency and ST Logistics. The high-performance fabric has a porous construction that allows for better air circulation, meaning it is 1.4 times as permeable as the Number 4 uniform. It also absorbs perspiration quickly and is 1.6 times as effective in drying.  The hybrid uniform is designed to be worn under the integrated load bearing vest during combat exercises and outfield activities. Soldiers will still be required to wear the Number 4 uniform for other routine activities. The new uniform began rolling out in January to soldiers from the Army combat units, chosen for their physically-demanding missions, with equipping to be completed by the end of this year. Each soldier will receive two pieces of the uniform. PTE Kugan said he feels a “genuine difference” wearing the hybrid uniform during strenuous training. “When you’re doing exercises, the Number 4 uniform drags on your body a lot, whereas this is rather smooth and comfortable.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saf-soldier-performance-centre-reducing-injury-rates-10449612"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 01:00PM", "tags": ["heat injury", "SAF", "MINDEF"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Death of NSF Dave Lee: Room for improvement in heat injury prevention and response, external panel finds", "content": " SINGAPORE: An external panel, convened in May after the death of full-time national serviceman Dave Lee, has said that improvements could be made to how the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) prevents and responds to heat injuries, Chief of Defence Force Major-General (MG) Melvyn Ong revealed on Tuesday (Jun 19). Corporal First Class (CFC) Lee, a Guardsman, died on Apr 30 nearly two weeks after \"displaying signs of heat injury\" following a fast march at Bedok Camp, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said. MINDEF convened the five-member panel on heat injury management, comprising experts from the Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and DSO National Laboratories, to independently review existing strategies for heat injury prevention and management in the SAF. “This panel has been going through the processes, measures and policies for heat injury management in the SAF,” MG Ong said in an interview ahead of SAF Day on Jul 1. “Two of the areas that they have suggested improvements are in the areas of prevention and response to heat injuries.” However, MG Ong said he was unable to disclose further details as the panel is “not ready yet”, adding that it will take a “few more months”. “We will wait for the findings and then we will share,” he added. “We’re working as quickly and as thoroughly as we can so we’ll get it out as soon as we can.” MINDEF said the panel has visited Bedok Camp to review the implementation of heat injury policies on the ground. The visit included a brief by Headquarters Guards and a demonstration of how heatstroke cases are treated at the medical centre. “The panel has provided feedback that the SAF’s heat injury policies and measures are essentially sound and aligned with prevalent industry and foreign military practices,” MINDEF said. “TEKAN” CULTURE At the same time, MG Ong said separate investigations into the incident are still ongoing. Besides the external review panel, a Committee of Inquiry is also investigating the circumstances leading to the death of CFC Lee. “Those who have been shown to have done something wrong over the course of the incident will be held accountable,” he said. “This, I guarantee you.” MG Ong’s pledge came as CFC Lee’s mother, in her son’s eulogy, called for an immediate halt to “tekan” or punishment sessions in the SAF. When asked about public comments regarding a “tekan” culture in the Guards formation, MG Ong said “there is a certain purpose to every training that we do”. “If there is no purpose, and the training is levied on the soldiers without reason, and there is an abuse of the way training is conducted in the process, we will hold them accountable,” added MG Ong, who is also a former chief Guards officer. MG Ong did not say whether commanders have been directed to stop “tekan” sessions, instead reiterating that the training purpose needs to be in line with what he called the unit’s mission essentials. “What the Army did in the aftermath of this incident was to emphasise that training needs to be accompanied with instructions, ample safety coverage and all the administrative practices and procedures that come along with it,” he added. When asked if “tekan” sessions could be conducted with the right purpose and safety coverage, MG Ong said “it’s important to realise that we need tough training”. “But the training must … relate to their task and be accompanied by the right reasons.” To that end, MG Ong said commanders from the top down have emphasised the need to ensure all training and practices are correctly implemented. “We have to look within ourselves, examine our safety processes and training programmes to make sure they’re all doing the right thing,” he added. “We’re reasonably confident that commanders are aware of their responsibilities and continue to train to one’s requirement.” Still, MG Ong said commanders were “affected and pained” by CFC Lee’s death. “The loss of every soldier hits to the heart, hits to the core of all that we are,” he stated. “We want all soldiers to go back to their families and when they don’t, we are deeply saddened.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/death-nsf-dave-lee-improvement-heat-injury-prevention-response-10449586"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 12:26PM", "tags": ["crime", "secret society"], "author": "Lydia Lam", "title": "Former policeman who was active member of secret society sentenced to a year's jail", "content": " SINGAPORE: A police officer who was an active member of two secret societies was on Wednesday (Jun 20) sentenced to a year's jail. Umar Hassan, 38, joined a well-known secret society which had a history of offences like armed robberies and kidnappings in 1996, the court heard. He left the society in May 1999 when he joined the Singapore Police Force, a position he held for 18 years. However, Umar, who was a Senior Staff Sergeant at the Ang Mo Kio Division, went back to the secret society in 2007 and became a senior gang member.  He was with the society for about nine years and eight months, the court heard. Umar also founded another secret society which began as a motorcycle group in 2001. He was an active recruiter for the gang, which he was a member of for about eight years, and asked for this gang to be affiliated to the first. He was arrested in November 2016 after a video clip of a group of men from this gang chanting gang slogans during a Malay wedding went viral on Facebook. Umar was in the WhatsApp chat group with the gang and he was aware that the gang members were providing the escort for the wedding convoy while wearing helmets with designs signalling gang affiliation. Six helmets and four shirts with designs related to the two secret societies were seized from Umar's home. UMAR'S MEMBERSHIP WAS NOT PASSIVE: DISTRICT JUDGE Umar was convicted on two charges of being a member of an unlawful society. \"The suppression of secret societies is a serious matter, and it has been a long-term problem,\" said Judge Jasvender. She noted that Umar was a senior member in the first gang and at the core of the second gang, as its headman.  \"The accused's membership was not passive,\" she said. \"He was involved in introducing people to the headman of (the first gang) for the purpose of being recruited as members.\" Judge Jasvender added that he gained protection for the second gang by affiliating the two, actively promoting the breach of the law by others. \"It is bad enough when an ordinary citizen joins a secret society,\" said the judge. \"Here, the accused was not an ordinary citizen. He was a serving police officer when he rejoined and professed membership as a senior gang member (of the first gang) and affiliated (the second gang) with it.\" While noting that there was no evidence that Umar abused his powers as a police officer, \"the fact that he was a serving police officer is plainly an aggravating factor of very considerable impact\". \"Nothing could be better calculated to undermine regard for the integrity of the Singapore Police Force than one of its members being a senior member of a secret society and a headman of a gang affiliated with it,\" Judge Jasvender said. In passing the sentence the judge said a strong message must be sent to law enforcement officers who knowingly contravene the law and participate in activities of unlawful societies.

And if it looks vaguely familiar, it’s probably because you’ve seen videos on social media of its bigger cousins roaming the beaches. Check out the video below.  They’re called Strandbeests and they’re the creations of Dutch artist Theo Janson, who will be presenting some of these at the ArtScience Museum beginning Saturday (Jun 23). The exhibition, titled Wind Walkers: Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests, will comprise 13 large-scale of these Strandbeests, or “beach animals” in Dutch.  It’s the artist’s first show in the region, and a major retrospective of his life work, having spent 28 years developing these wind-powered machines, which he has described as a “new species on Earth”. Among the highlights is Animaris Siamesis, the largest “beest” in the show, which measures 10 metres long and weights over 240kg. Trained as a physicist before becoming an artist, Jansen has exhibited in various galleries and museums around the world, and has even starred in an episode of The Simpsons. The moving sculptures were originally envisioned as wind-powered creations that roamed beaches to form natural barriers against the threat of flooding due to rising sea levels. “There are few people working in any field today who embody the intersection of art and science as beautifully as Jansen. For nearly 30 years, he has combined his understanding of science, with his artistic skill to engineer mechanical animals that appear startlingly alive,” said Honor Harger, the museum’s executive director.

It was a simple question, posed with a CNA Insider video about the life of a Muslim Bangladeshi worker during Ramadan, and it drew an instant and overwhelming response from dozens of viewers: Yes, we would. Over the past two weekends, eight of these families did just that, opening up their hearts and homes to the men who build Singapore’s roads and high-rises. The hosts ranged from Singaporeans of Bangladeshi descent, to non-Muslims who catered specially for their guests’ halal diet. And the experience turned out to be more than either hosts or guests had imagined – and the start of hopefully lasting friendships for some. “When we saw the video feature by CNA insider, it really struck a chord with us,” said Tayef Quader, 30. “We have never had the opportunity to show them our appreciation and host them at our own home, so we jumped at it. Sharing our meal during this holy month is an even greater blessing.” At an iftar meal facilitated by CNA Insider on the last Sunday before Hari Raya Puasa, his wife Farhana Hossain cooked dishes like chicken biryani and beef tripe curry – a Bengali delicacy which their guests, Md Al Mamun, 26, and Md Shahabuddin, 30, appreciated. The couple, who work at a local university and are of Bangladeshi extract, exchanged numbers with the men and said they would “love” to host them again in future. Over at the home of Mohammad Hamim and Fatimah Sawifi that same night, 32-year-old Shariful Islam was feeling emotional. The father of one was reminded of his daughter – an eight-year-old also named Fatimah – many times that night. “I’m missing my mother, my wife, and my daughter Fatimah, I so miss, so miss,” he told CNA Insider, eyes welling up. Together breaking fast, together praying, I feel my family here today. Today, I’m happy.  Thank you for this today. Host Mr Hamim, 48, had only ever exchanged cursory greetings with migrant workers at the mosque before this. “Deep down inside we’ve always wanted to know more about them,” he said. And learn more they did, chatting easily with their guests about family, religion, their experiences working abroad. “I was pleasantly surprised. We were able to connect at various levels,” said Mdm Fatimah. It was so very enlightening, we were wondering what held us back (from talking to them) in the past – they are just like us, they have families, they have somewhat the same interests. The couple, both teachers, gave the workers Hari Raya gifts, packed enough food for them for the rest of the week, and drove them back to their dormitory in Mandai. (Read: 'My heart cries': Muslim migrant workers ache for family this Ramadan, and 'We need to take the first step': Giving migrant workers a taste of home away from home) UNDERSTANDING AND ADMIRATION At this past Hari Raya weekend, CNA Insider collaborated with the volunteer-run Interfaith Youth Circle (IYC) and SDI Academy – a social enterprise that teaches English to migrant workers – to link host families up with more guests. Among the Singaporean hosts was Marlene Chua, 28, a civil servant. She and her sister prepared rice and finger food, and got “a few types of curry” from an Indian-Muslim stall for a “simple and cosy” lunch. They meant it as a gesture of appreciation for the workers, and a step “toward understanding them further”; and they ended up making new friends and learning more about Singapore from them.  Such as how many durian trees there were at Mandai – “they volunteered to pick some for us”, Ms Chua laughed. Nicholas Yeo, 31, was another non-Muslim who made sure his guests were catered for, getting a Muslim friend to whip up a home-cooked spread. “My wife, friends and I just set out to treat them like we would anyone else, and it was a great chance to get to know them better,” he said. They learnt more about the struggles that migrant workers face in Singapore – but also found admiration for the volunteer work the men did, and “their dedication to improve themselves in spite of the limited free time they have”. By having a safe and comfortable space, it really allowed us to speak with them as equals. “And we were able to relate with one another over many common experiences, despite being so seemingly different,\" added Mr Yeo. To facilitate the home visits at short notice, CNA Insider tied up with SDI Academy and the IYC, which was organising its fourth Singaporean Muslims for Eid initiative. The latter aims to involve different groups – like migrant workers and non-Muslims – in the Eid celebrations. IYC co-founder Ms Noor Mastura said she hoped that people’s negative stereotypes of each other would be “shattered through their interactions over food and culture”. She also hoped participants would “become ambassadors to their own communities of what they learnt”. WOULD DO THIS AGAIN Indeed, although one or two had initial nerves, the host families strongly urged more Singaporeans to reach out and invite migrant workers to a meal. It would “give them the chance to feel part of a family… something many of us would want if we were in the same situation”, Mr Yeo said, adding that he would be glad to do this “on an annual or even more regular basis”. Mr Liton, 40, might agree. The Bangladeshi, who was hosted by a couple to iftar, said: “We never felt like we were different here. We’re Muslim, they’re Muslim, we break fast together.” \"Hosting them is like having friends over,\" said Ms Chua. \"Migrant workers make up a huge part of our society and life, and yet we know so little about them.\"  The difficulty, Mr Hamim said, is: “I think Singaporeans are very open, but we don’t know how to go about reaching out. It’s very difficult to just go up to them and say ‘hello, what's going on’.” For now, CNA Insider is planning over the next few weeks to facilitate more outstanding requests to host migrant workers of any nationality. Those interested can contact the team via Facebook. But as some viewers have pointed out on Facebook, one can also do one’s bit where one can. Lynette Enoch posted: “I treat my Bangladeshi friends here to a meal now and then, or drinks due to the weather.” Noraini Khodri-Siebley wrote that during Ramadan, she cooked an extra portion every weekend “for the Bangladeshi boy who cleans my block. He’s just like my son. Maybe he’s not comfortable sitting with my family... at least he would take his Iftar which we prepared.” Read & watch CNA Insider’s Ramadan Diaries series: 'My heart cries': Muslim migrant workers ache for family this Ramadan 'We need to take the first step': Giving migrant workers a taste of home away from home 'It's a blessing': Why a millennial 'towkay' fasted with his Muslim migrant workers", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/just-like-us-singaporeans-home-meal-migrant-workers-hari-raya-10449216"}, {"datetime": "20 Jun 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["consumer", "Internet", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "Army of fake reviewers being built to dupe buyers, drive online sales", "content": " SINGAPORE: As an online reviewer, Lynn is trusted to test and review products, such as those on Chinese shopping website Taobao. And she gets paid a few hundred dollars for each positive review she posts, never mind that she does not try out some of the items but makes up her evaluations instead – with companies in on the flat-out fakery. She is part of an army of fake reviewers secretly hired by recruiting companies that manage the online reputations of businesses. “They send me the link to the product, then they’d ask me to give a good review,” she disclosed. Lynn (not her real name), who is in her 30s, writes about three to four reviews a month, and knows some full-time fake reviewers who earn about S$1,600 a month. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n And this industry is booming. One recruiting company disclosed to the programme Talking Point that it has some 80,000 people from the region, including Singapore, on its payroll. (Watch the episode here.) The prevalence of fake reviewers has risen in tandem with the boom in online shopping. A 2016 report by Google and Temasek Holdings had projected that Singapore’s e-commerce market will grow more than five times to US$5.4 billion (S$7.3 billion) within a decade. And buyers are taking the fake bait. UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY A 2016 survey by business consultancy PwC showed that social media is exerting a stronger influence, on average, on online shopping behaviour in Singapore. Some 57 per cent of respondents here used social media to read reviews, compared with 45 per cent globally. And data analytics lecturer Koh Noi Sian from Nanyang Polytechnic, who has done research into user-generated online content, said positive reviews have been found to increase sales by 9 per cent. “Family members and friends have the most impact on their (consumers’) purchase decisions … followed by online reviews,” she said. This is why some retailers engage online reputation companies to churn out reviews for their products and services. “It’s actually an underground activity, and then these reputation companies would also hire individuals secretly,” said Dr Koh. In this activity called brushing – placing fake reviews – these individuals use fake accounts built on the real identities of people located overseas. “Then they’d post positive reviews to help boost the review ratings of these products,” said Dr Koh, adding that fake reviews can contribute up to six billion yuan (S$1.26 billion) in sales, according to one study. Amazon claims that fake reviews make up fewer than 10 per cent of its reviews, but the distribution of positive reviews is about 80 per cent or more, noted Dr Koh, who called this “very skewed” and “very unusual”. One recruiting company looking for writers to review products on Taobao told Talking Point that it was helping businesses to boost their sales through fake orders and positive reviews. The recruiter, which was not named, explained why businesses resort to this practice. “When customers shop online, they’d only browse the top few sellers listed on the search. With brushing, we’re able to boost our rankings so that we’re visible when customers do a search for products,” said the recruiter. When asked if this was cheating, the recruiter said it was a “marketing strategy”. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n HOW TO TELL FAKE FROM REAL With fake reviews being churned out easily and on a large scale, how can one tell a bogus review from a legitimate one? Mr Simon Yap, the web development director of Oasis Web Asia, a web development company, said some websites such as reviewmeta.com can help to analyse the online reviews in that regard. What consumers can do is to copy the URL of the reviewed product and paste it on the website, which would run a report on the review. “There’d be some percentage of suspicious reviews that would be removed by the analyser,” explained Mr Yap. “Suspicious reviewers are normally reviewers who’ve created accounts just to review the particular product or brand … or there are a lot of repeated words to promote the product, which (the analysis) picked out as suspicious.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Such website analysers are not 100 per cent accurate, however, and do not work on all platforms, such as TripAdvisor, one of the largest travel sites in the world, with more than 630 million reviews. TripAdvisor spokesperson Amolakh Calais said it does “red-flag any property that partakes in malicious activity”. And since 2015, it has shut out about 60 companies that had taken part in working with fake reviews. Every review on TripAdvisor goes through a very vigorous vetting process. We have a set of tracing tools that map the how, the where, the what and the when of every single review. “We have a very robust system which identifies certain trends in reviews,\" he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n So how else can consumers sieve out the fake reviews, without resorting to website analysers? “Consumers can look for more balanced reviews with pros and cons on the products,” said Dr Koh. “They can also go into other websites, search for the same products and read the reviews too, and have a more balanced view.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

The Ministry of Finance announced on Wednesday (Jun 20) that it is seeking feedback on the proposal after reviewing the issue with the Ministry of Transport, noting that cabbies and private-hire car drivers now provide similar point-to-point transport services.

Subject to conditions, such drivers will be allowed to claim tax deductions for: Alternatively, the private-hire car driver may opt to claim tax deduction based on the actual amount of running expenses and service fees incurred in earning driving income, said the Finance Ministry. The proposed changes come amid calls by the National Private Hire Vehicles Association to tax drivers more fairly and in line with the tax deductibles for taxi drivers. Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong had said in Parliament last month that the current tax system is \"in support of our long-standing policy on car ownership\". Still, he added that the Government is looking at how it can refine the tax policy given the feedback from the association and some Members of Parliament.

Hawke, a critically endangered male hawksbill turtle, and Louie, an endangered green sea turtle, were released by the SEA Aquarium into the waters around Singapore in the hope that they breed and increase the population in the wild.  Hawke was released at about 10.50am in the waters of Sisters' Island Marine Park while Louie was released about an hour later in the waters of Pulau Semakau, SEA Aquarium and Resorts World Sentosa said in a press release. \"Both started swimming immediately in the water and disappeared from sight within seconds,\" said the two organisations. \"Following the release, Louie was later spotted swimming near the same boat with its head out of the water, as though it was bidding farewell to its caretakers.\" The turtles were tagged and microchipped so they could be identified should they return to Singapore's shores, they said, adding that the two release points were chosen in consultation with the National Parks Board. \"It is an emotional moment for our team today to see Hawke and Louie return to the ocean, but our end goal has always been to nurse these turtles back to health and release them back into their natural environment,\" said Mr Kenneth Kwang Keng Hei, aquarist at SEA Aquarium. \"Our team has spent more than two exciting years caring for them like our babies and it is an aquarist’s dream to see our animals grow healthy after rehabilitation and return to the wild so they can contribute to the overall marine ecosystem.” Both turtles had made their \"official debut\" during World Turtle Day last year and were the first sea turtles to join SEA Aquarium's marine life collection, according to the aquarium and Resorts World Sentosa. Louie was only one week old when it was handed over to the aquarium on Sep 28, 2015. The turtle had been found by a member of the public in a drain, and weighed only 20g when it first arrived at the aquarium. It has since grown to about 61cm in length and weighs 21.5kg. Hawke arrived at the aquarium on Mar 24, 2016 after being found in the sea by a member of the public. Believed to have been abandoned by its owner, who had kept it illegally as a pet, the turtle weighed 800g when it first arrived but has since grown to 59cm in length and weighs 23kg. In addition, it has a slightly pyramided carapace - a shell deformity likely attributed to poor nutrition and care during its early years, according to the aquarium and Resorts World Sentosa. To prepare the turtles for their release, Hawke and Louie were gradually moved from back-of-house areas to larger habitats at the aquarium to \"encourage exploration\" and interaction with other \"compatible marine life\", said the aquarium and Resorts World Sentosa. In addition, the aquarists fed the turtles a diet similar to that found in the wild including items such as sea jellies, squids and prawns. Before their release, the aquarium's animal health team conducted a \"thorough veterinary examination\" which indicated both were healthy and suitable for release. According to the aquarium and Resorts World Sentosa, there are seven different species of sea turtles: Green, hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, leatherback, loggerhead and flatback. Of these, six are considered threatened according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

The Gao Kosong version only contains sugar that is naturally present in milk and malt - the two key ingredients in Milo. Speaking at the pop-up Milo Gao Kosong Pit Stop at Plaza Singapura, where President Halimah Yacob was also in attendance, Nestle Singapore managing director Rajiv Deraniyagala said that the drink is the result of a challenge posed by the President. \"It was about eight, nine months ago when we had this conversation with President Halimah Yacob on what we can do to reduce the sugar in Milo,\" Mr Deraniyagala said. \"We were introducing our new Milo Gao Siew Dai to her at the time and she challenged us and asked the question: Is it possible to have a Milo with no added sugar?

A sham marriage, or marriage of convenience, is a ruse to help foreigners enter Singapore or extend their stay here. The act was criminalised in 2012. Of the 17 syndicate members, 12 have been convicted, two left Singapore before investigation started, one was not charged due to a medical condition and court proceedings against two of them are ongoing.  The men, Singaporeans aged between 23 and 45, entered the sham marriages for money while the women, all Vietnamese aged between 22 and 35, wanted to prolong their stay in Singapore. “They were taught to understand each other’s background to avoid detection by the enforcement agencies. One of the local spouses had flown to Vietnam to meet and understand the foreign spouse’s family background,” said officer-in-charge of special investigations Assistant Superintendent Ong Teck Wee. The syndicate was made up of four arrangers - three Singaporean men and one Vietnamese woman who orchestrated seven sham marriages. The purported ringleader was Jeremy Tan, who was involved in fixing five sham marriages. The 32-year-old was in January this year sentenced to two years in jail and fined S$42,000 - the harshest punishment so far for sham marriages.  ICA said that Tan had suggested to several Singaporean men, who were in financial difficulties or who wanted to earn extra income, to enter a marriage of convenience. The men were promised a sum of money for doing so.  Tan facilitated meetings between the men and their foreign spouses and told them they did not need to fulfil any marriage obligation.  HOW TAN STARTED OUT Tan arranged the first sham marriage in 2014, when he introduced his friend Alvin Quek, 27, to Vietnamese Le Y Senl, 28, at a barbeque in East Coast Park. Tan suggested that Quek marry the woman, who was on a 30-day visit pass, so she could extend her stay in Singapore.  Quek agreed and the wedding took place on Dec 8 that year. According to court documents, he received S$800 as a reward. Le gave Tan S$6,000 for arranging the marriage.  Quek and Le stayed separately. Quek also went on to arrange other marriages, and was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in jail in August 2017. Le was jailed for six months.  Between November 2016 and April 2017, Tan syndicate arranged more marriages of convenience.  It was the investigation into one such marriage early last year that unravelled the work of the syndicate. In November 2016, Tan and 35-year-old Vietnamese national “Jenny” collaborated and arranged a marriage of convenience between Le Nhu Ngoc, 24, and Ong Yao Hui, 24. Le paid Tan S$12,000 for the arrangement, while Ong received S$800.  The marriage took place on Jan 14, 2017 at a barbeque pit in East Coast Park. ICA said it received a tip-off from someone who knew the couple.  CRACKING SHAM MARRIAGES 'A CHALLENGE' ICA figures show that 53 people were convicted of marriage of convenience related offences last year, down from 124 in 2013. While the numbers have come down, ICA officers said that cracking such cases and prosecuting suspects remain a challenge. Speaking about the case, senior prosecution officer Muhammad Izzat Abdul Rahman said that based on the large number of people involved, it was hard to uncover the overall narrative because of different people saying different things. “Generally speaking, for a marriage of convenience case, especially a syndicated case, evidence is not as forthcoming as in other immigration offences,” he added.  For example, for overstayers, there is clear evidence - a pass - to show that a person has overstayed.  “For a marriage of convenience case, however, the evidence is not so concrete, so it requires more effort to unearth this evidence to be able to make out the offences,” he said.  He urged members of the public to come forth with information if they suspected that anyone was in a marriage of convenience. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ica-busts-large-syndicate-sham-marriages-vietnamese-women-10446672"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 05:20PM", "tags": ["employment"], "author": "", "title": "Civil servants to get 0.5-month mid-year bonus, one-off lump sum payment of at least S$300", "content": " SINGAPORE: Civil servants in Singapore will receive a 0.5-month mid-year bonus and a one-off payment of at least S$300, the Public Service Division (PSD) said on Tuesday (Jun 19).

If these potential rescue financiers are interested in pursuing a concrete arrangement, the parties will proceed to a more advanced stage of discussions where more documents and information will be released.  RUNNING OUT OF CASH The court hearing on Tuesday comes after Hyflux and five of its subsidiaries on May 22 applied to the High Court to begin a reorganisation of its debt and businesses.  In a statement, it cited “prolonged weakness” in Singapore’s power market for its financial woes, leading to “short-term liquidity constraints”. The homegrown firm, which first made its mark in water treatment and later ventured into power generation, had described the move to seek court protection from creditors as necessary to “protect its operations while it seeks to reorganise its businesses and liabilities”. The application to court automatically gives it a 30-day moratorium.  In laying out its case for an extended six-month moratorium against creditors, Hyflux’s lawyers mentioned the company could “run out of available cash in four to five weeks”.  The arguments put forth also include the need for extra time to divest its key assets, such as Tuaspring which has “significant value” and should not be rushed into a sale, its lawyers said. A short runway with repeated applications for extensions will also create uncertainty and discourage third-party financiers from supporting the company, they added.  An extension of six months will also give the company “a strong platform” to properly engage its diverse stakeholders, which include banks, trade creditors, as well as 34,000 holders of preference shares and perpetual securities.  But it was not all without objections. Lawyers representing some of Hyflux’s biggest creditors argued that the water treatment specialist should not be extended a six-month moratorium.  Representing Mizuho, a lawyer from TSMP Law Corporation said a moratorium of two to three months will be “reasonable” for Hyflux to engage its various stakeholders and come up with more detailed solutions. Mizuho is Hyflux’s second biggest creditor, holding approximately S$235.2 million of debt.  KFW IPEX-Bank also supported a shorter moratorium, with a lawyer from Cavenagh Law noting that the bank might support an extension if it sees “genuine progress”.  At the end of the two-hour-long hearing, the court granted Hyflux with an extension of a six-month moratorium but ordered the company to provide an update of its reorganisation plans at the three-month mark and hold a status conference two weeks after that.  WE WANT ANSWERS: RETAIL INVESTOR The recent troubles at Hyflux have caught many mom-and-pop investors off guard, with the company’s shares and related securities being halted from trading since May 21.  The SGX-listed counter last changed hands at S$0.21 on May 18 before the trading halt. Year to date, it has fallen 45 per cent.  A handful of retail investors attended the court hearing on Tuesday. One of them was Mr Martin Lee who holds Hyflux’s preference shares, perpetual securities and ordinary shares.  “I’m here to see how it goes and what’s the outcome of this,” he told Channel NewsAsia, while adding that the company’s financial situation has been unexpected for many retail investors like him. Commenting on the townhall meeting that Hyflux is aiming to hold for investors, he said: “There’s a lot of uncertainty and we want answers.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-granted-six-month-reprieve-from-creditors-high-court-10446576"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 01:08PM", "tags": ["cybersecurity", "phishing", "cyber threats", "CSA"], "author": "", "title": "Online threats moved past profit, targeted ‘massive disruption’ in 2017: CSA report", "content": " SINGAPORE: The online threat landscape continues to evolve globally and attacks have shifted from being profit-driven to those aimed at causing massive disruption such as the ​​​​​​​WannaCry ransomware campaign, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said on Tuesday (Jun 19). Singapore, being a highly connected country, mirrored these global trends with attacks such as phishing, website defacements and malware infections the main threats reported to the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) last year, according to the agency’s Singapore Cyber Landscape 2017 report released on Tuesday. Phishing was the top of the list of threats reported, comprising about 39 per cent of the total number. Specifically, there were 23,420 phishing URLs with a Singapore link detected last year, while commonly spoofed websites include those from technology vendors like Microsoft and Apple, file-hosting services like Dropbox and financial services like PayPal, the report said. Other top threats reported include compromised systems (21 per cent) and ransomware (17 per cent), it added. There were about 750 systems identified to be controlling networks of bots, with a daily average of about 2,700 botnet drones with Singapore IP addresses, CSA said. It added that of the more than 400 malware variants detected in 2017, five – Conficker, Mirai, Cutwail, Sality and WannaCry – accounted for more than half of the systems infected daily. “The majority of these malware are not new, suggesting that many victims are not scanning for viruses and cleaning up their systems,” it said. The agency said Singapore was relatively unscathed by major ransomware campaigns such as WannaCry, with 25 cases reported to SingCERT last year. It did point out that victims were also infected by other variants such as Cerber, Dharma and Sage, and faced ransom demands ranging between S$2,000 and S$4,000. The global ransomware campaign last May affected the operations of hospitals in the United Kingdom, as well as major organisations like telco Telefonica and global shipper FedEx. CYBERCRIME VICTIMS LOST MORE THAN S$95 MILLION The Singapore Cyber Landscape 2017 report noted that cybercrime continues to grow here, with 5,430 such cases reported last year. Online cheating and cyber extortion accounted for 82.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent of all cybercrime cases, while the remaining 15.9 per cent involved compromised social media and SingPass accounts, impersonation scams, ransomware, unauthorised access, among others – all of which are offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. In total, victims suffered losses of more than S$95 million last year, the study said. An Internet love scam was identified as the highest loss in a single case, amounting to about S$6 million, it added.    Singapore’s cybersecurity czar David Koh said in the foreword of the report that the country’s move to being a Smart Nation will bring benefits to many, but everyone needs to be savvy users of this connectivity. “We know that we are only as strong as our weakest link,” Mr Koh said. “Therefore, we all need to do our part to ensure basic cyber hygiene is in place such as using stronger passwords, to keep our networks trusted and secure.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/online-threats-moved-past-profit-targeted-massive-disruption-in-10446262"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 11:57AM", "tags": ["food", "National Environment Agency"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "New food hygiene recognition scheme to replace existing grading system", "content": " SINGAPORE: From late 2020, the existing food hygiene grading system for food retail establishments in Singapore will be replaced with a new scheme, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced on Tuesday (Jun 19).  Under the new Food Hygiene Recognition Scheme, food establishments with at least two years of \"strong track record\" in hygiene will be awarded Bronze, Silver or Gold based on a set of criteria, NEA said in a media release.  Those without “major hygiene lapses” under NEA’s demerit point system for two years or more will receive a Bronze award. Lapses include failing to keep the premises clean or pests found in the premises.  Those without any such lapses for at least five years will receive a Silver award, and those who maintain their record for at least 10 years will get a Gold award.  Award holders will be given a decal to display at their premises. If an establishment commits any serious hygiene infringements or has been implicated in a food poisoning incident, the award may be subsequently downgraded. EXISTING GRADING SYSTEM HAS “REACHED ITS LIMITS”: NEA   Explaining the rationale for the change, NEA’s director-general for environmental health Derek Ho said that the existing grading system, where operators receive an A, B, C or D grading, has “reached its limits”. “Ninety-nine per cent of licensees have already reached an A or B grade, so it’s more difficult for consumers to distinguish the better performers from amongst this pool of licensed premises,” he said.  All NEA-licensed food retail establishments in Singapore are required to meet the necessary hygiene requirements to operate. This includes having the necessary infrastructure and trained expertise to ensure safe preparation, handling and sale of food.  Over and above these licensing requirements, they are currently graded A, B, C or D annually based on an assessment of the premises’ hygiene standards by NEA inspectors. The existing grading system, which was first introduced in 1997, has “helped to raise the hygiene standards” of food retail establishments in Singapore, said NEA. For example, 99 per cent of licensees were graded A or B as of Dec 31 last year, compared to 77 per cent in 2006. However, NEA pointed out that under the system, consumers may not know which operators have been more consistent in upholding hygiene standards as their track records are not factored in. Operators, regardless of their grades, would still end up with serious lapses, and could even be linked to food poisoning outbreaks.  Replacing the current grading system with the new scheme, said NEA, will encourage operators to practise good hygiene at all times, and be consistent with their efforts. SOME FOOD OPERATORS CAN COME ON BOARD EARLY To phase in the new scheme, those who currently hold an A grade – about 55 per cent of the approximately 36,000 licensed food establishments here – will be invited to apply for the new scheme on a voluntary basis from April 2019. Those which meet the criteria will be given the award decal for display, in place of the grading decal.  The new scheme will take effect fully from late 2020 for the rest of the food retail industry. “All existing licensees will therefore have sufficient time to attain at least a Bronze award if they maintain a good track record henceforth,” said NEA. New licensees will display a label indicating “Working towards excellent hygiene track record” which is valid for up to two years before NEA assesses their eligibility for a Bronze award.  NEED FOR CONSUMER EDUCATION, SO THEY KNOW A BRONZE DOESN’T EQUATE TO A ‘C’ GRADE Operators Channel NewsAsia spoke to saw the benefits of the new system. “It’s the next step to take,” said Mr Ryk Chew, who operates a rice dumpling stall at Amoy Street Food Centre. Pointing out the drawback in the existing system, he explained that stall operators could clean up their stall just before NEA inspectors visit. “But who knows? Maybe after the grading’s done and they get an A grade, they don’t give a hoot about their hygiene in the ongoing daily operations,” he said. “But the new system puts all the stallholders on their toes, because if there’s any lapse, there goes their award, and it will take a long time for them to get it back to what it was.” Co-founder of Waa Cow cafe Aaron Yeo likened the new system to that of an airline safety record. “Hygiene is like safety, where one minor misstep could spell disaster, so the new grading system has placed an emphasis on ensuring that consumers are able to make informed choices regarding which establishments treat hygiene seriously,” he said. But he also stressed the importance of educating consumers about the new system, so that they would not perceive those with a Bronze award as being not as clean as those with a Gold. “It takes a long time to get a Gold, so the public must first be able to appreciate those establishments that have gotten it, but also understand that those which have not yet gotten that rating are not necessarily unhygienic,” he said. This was also a point made by owner of Kettle Pot cafe Terence Lieu. “Let’s say I’m a consumer, and I see a Bronze award at a new cafe,” he said. “It looks like a downgrade ... like the Bronze equates to a C rating in the current system.” He suggested that both grading systems run concurrently, so that operators could, for example, display an A grade and a Bronze award. “After one or two years, they can phase out the grading system. So consumers can understand the change in the system.” “Beside the rating, there should be an explanation, as well as the whole grading scale,” added Waa Cow’s Mr Yeo. “So consumers can see for themselves.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-food-hygiene-recognition-scheme-to-replace-existing-grading-10446030"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 10:37AM", "tags": ["Singapore Power", "Electric Vehicle"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Singapore’s largest electric vehicle charging network to have 500 charging points islandwide by 2020", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore’s largest electric vehicle (EV) charging network - consisting of 500 charging points islandwide - will be made available in public areas such as malls, residential areas and business parks by 2020, Singapore Power (SP) Group announced on Tuesday (Jun 19).   The network, which SP Group said will be a boost for electric vehicle adoption in Singapore, will first be rolled out with 30 charging points that will be in operation by end-2018.   “Singapore is regarded as an ideal environment for EVs as it is highly urbanised and compact,” SP Group said.  “This pervasive charging network will plug a critical gap in scaling up EV adoption in Singapore by reducing range anxiety in EV drivers,” it added.  SP Group's head for strategic development Goh Chee Kiong told media that there is a concern among drivers that their vehicles will \"run out of juice\" when driving from point A to point B, and the launch of a large charging network is crucial to giving these drivers \"peace of mind\".  In tandem with the charging points, SP also announced the launch of two tenders for the network. The tenders are for the procurement of charging hardware for both AC (alternating current) and DC (direct current) chargers, and for the installation of the chargers.  The national utility company highlighted that of the 500 charging points, more than 100 will be 50kW-DC charging points, a fast charge technology that can fully charge an EV in 30 minutes.  According to SP Group, the technology allows EVs to be charged three to seven times faster than predominant EV chargers available in Singapore today, which are rated at 7.4kW.  \"And that gives drivers more comfort when charging their EVs with us ... and provides them a faster turnaround time,\" explained Mr Goh.  MOBILE APP TO SHOWCASE CHARGING STATIONS  Additionally, the group will also be introducing an SP Group mobile application to allow drivers to locate available charging stations in Singapore. Besides that, the application can also provide drivers with automated updates on their charging progress and electronic payment modes for use of the charging points.  \"Through the app, we will be also be able to provide information to the EV drivers on whether charging has been completed as well as the charging duration of the cars,\" explained Mr Goh.  In terms of costs, Mr Goh explained that the pricing plan for the charging stations will be released closer to the launch of the network at the end of the year, but he confirmed that the pricing will be \"tiered\" based on the type of chargers.  In 2016, SP Group’s EV journey commenced when it started to convert its entire vehicle fleet to electric vehicles. As of Jun 19, the company said it has 30 EVs, with 40 charging points across 13 locations.  SP Group said the move allowed it to develop its capabilities to operate an internal charging network that will now be scaled up to a nationwide public charging network.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-largest-electric-vehicle-charging-network-to-have-10445736"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 10:06AM", "tags": ["Consumers Association of Singapore", "Singapore Airlines", "Jetstar", "Scoot"], "author": "", "title": "Be wary of pre-ticked boxes when making an online purchase, CASE warns", "content": " SINGAPORE: Customers should be wary of pre-ticked boxes when making purchases online, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said on Tuesday (Jun 19).  In an advisory on its website, the consumer watchdog said such boxes are typically used by businesses to obtain consent from consumers for the purchase of additional goods or services, or to receive marketing materials.  Customers may not realise that they need to opt out of these pre-selected options if they do not want such goods or services.

The Greater Bay Area aims to bring together Hong Kong, Macau and nine southern Chinese cities to form a business powerhouse that will seek to rival other metropolitan megacity hubs and mimic the likes of Los Angeles, New York or Tokyo. OCBC, Singapore's second-largest listed lender, expects the launch of the wealth management business and the expansion of its banking presence in the Greater Bay Area to be a \"new growth driver\" for the bank, CEO Samuel Tsien said. The bank did not give a timeline for the launch, which will be subject to regulatory approvals. These plans should help OCBC double its profit before tax in the Greater Bay Area to more than S$1 billion by 2023, Tsien told reporters in Hong Kong. OCBC is also looking to raise its headcount by 40 percent to more than 4,200 in the area over the period, Tsien added. OCBC, which counts Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia as its main markets, already has a wholly owned banking unit in China with presence in cities including Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Zuhai, as well as bank branches in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

But we also believe it is a matter of people not being able to structure it in a way that private banking clients would like to have,\" Tsien said. \"The market is developing, there will be more and more products available and you will need banks to pull that together into a structured portfolio for the private banking clients.\" China's onshore private wealth market has grown 12 per cent since 2017 and is estimated to reach 159 trillion yuan (US$25 trillion) this year, according to consultant BCG, making it the second-largest such market after the United States. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/ocbc-china-wealth-management-business-10445500"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 06:23AM", "tags": ["Camel nuts", "SMEs", "digitisation", "Industry 4.0"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Camel nuts manufacturer hopes to crack open efficiency gains with IT makeover", "content": " SINGAPORE: “Not all things good and expensive are the best for smaller businesses,” said Ms Poh Shih Yin, director at Seng Hua Hng Foodstuff, as she related the pitfalls in the company's digitisation journey. The local small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME), which manufactures the well-known Camel brand of nuts, has been in business for more than four decades.  An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system by Oracle  - a “big and bulky system” which it implemented about 20 years ago - proved to be ill-suited for a business of its size, Ms Poh shared during an interview with Channel NewsAsia on Monday (Jun 18). ERP systems typically integrate the management of a company’s key business processes. “We had to change our processes to work around the system,” she pointed out, adding it was ultimately more of a costly hindrance than of help. Another IT project saw the SME engage a local vendor, Mevo, in 2008 to deploy a mobile sales management device allowing its representatives to more easily keep track of their customers’ inventory and key in their orders. However, Ms Poh shared that it was a “single-use device” limited in functionality. For instance, the original version was not wireless and all the data in the device could only be synced with the system when it was docked. The current version it is using has more functions with barcode scanning for inventory tracking and wireless capabilities - but on 3G mobile network and reliant on a SIM card which can be “quite costly”, she noted. These are just some of the challenges of navigating the current IT procurement landscape for local SMEs, which typically aren’t at the forefront of technology adoption. “There are lots of things we have to do,” in terms of digitising the traditional food manufacturing business, Ms Poh acknowledged. And there is no lack of desire to transform its operations either. The director shared that in the current tight labour market, digitisation actually helps ease its dependence on manpower. Seng Hua Hng currently has 170 employees, with about 40 in warehousing and sales. The SME makes about S$60 million annually. “It is difficult to find entry-level, rank-and-file staff these days ... and many of our current employees are double-hatting,” Ms Poh shared. This difficulty was attributed to tougher rules on bringing in foreign labour, as well as the job environment which she admitted “was not exactly cushy” given that it can get hot and oily when roasting the nuts, for instance. Technology can thus play a part in easing the SME’s dependence on labour by automating many of its current processes and cutting down the paper trail, such as having an integrated sales inventory management system. To have this in place, though, its warehouse will need adequate wireless coverage which is currently lacking. Its current routers were not able to provide adequate coverage for the 5,000-8,000 sq ft space, which has several hard-to-reach areas when Channel NewsAsia visited the space. When it sought out a vendor to rectify this situation recently, it was quoted S$100,000 which was too pricey. “We can’t be spending S$100,000 to S$200,000 on just one area,” Ms Poh said candidly. It was a good thing then that the food manufacturer won an IT makeover contest conducted by enterprise tech giant Cisco in April this year. With the win, Seng Hua Hng will be receiving about S$40,000 of Cisco products and services, which include wireless routers and virtual meeting room tool Webex Board. The latter has proven useful as the SME is currently setting up a factory in Xiamen, China, and the project manager can cut down on the number of times he had to fly to China, which was “almost every month”, the director shared. “Digital transformation is our key focus in the next two years to bring the next phase of our growth strategy to life,” said Mr Colin Chin, group finance manager of the SME, in a blog post by Cisco announcing the competition winner. Ms Poh also credited the Singapore Government for starting to address a key SME pain point: Finding out which specific operation within the business needs to be digitised, and how. She noted that in a company’s digitisation journey, there are many buzzwords like cloud computing and big data to make sense of. “How much of these are suited for our use?” the director asked rhetorically. Last November, the Singapore Economic Development Board partnered TUV SUD to launch the Singapore Smart Industry Readiness Index, which allows companies to evaluate the current state of their facilities, understand Industry 4.0 concepts and design a transformation roadmap. Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon then announced in March this year that 300 Singapore-based companies can get a free evaluation of their readiness to move into Industry 4.0.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/camel-nuts-manufacturer-hopes-to-crack-open-efficiency-gains-10442684"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 06:23AM", "tags": ["Kim Jong Un", "Donald Trump", "Trump-kim"], "author": "Albert Wai", "title": "The Big Read: Forget dollars and cents. Trump-Kim summit’s real value is in affirming Singapore’s place in the world  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: It was a surreal moment last Tuesday morning (June 12) when United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shook hands in front of a global audience, heralding a remarkable thaw in ties between two of the world's fiercest adversaries. History was made, and Singapore, as the host, would be noted for its small contribution to world peace and security. In the days leading up to and after the summit, many headlines were focused on the quid pro quo for the host nation of staging an event that the world's spotlight would be trained on.  That, said analysts, is just scratching the surface, and the key benefit for Singapore is something less tangible, but much more important: Another example of the country's oft-cited ability to punch above its weight, the value of even-handed, straight-talking diplomacy, and a buttressing of its soft power. Singapore's role in the event is testament to its value to the international order and the effectiveness of its foreign policy, they said. The Republic is one of the few countries that has developed deep and wide-ranging ties with Washington while keeping lines of communication open with Pyongyang amid tight international sanctions. It has been a tough balancing act for the country, which has pursued an even-handed brand of foreign policy — aiming to be a friend to all and enemy of none — in accordance with international law, but one that has paid off time and again, and in terms that cannot be measured merely by price tags: A hard-earned reputation as an honest broker, willing to speak hard truths, and a valued counsel to bigger powers. This, analysts said, is the true value that being chosen to host a high-profile, history-making summit brings to Singapore. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) political scientist Woo Jun Jie said: The fact that Singapore was chosen to play such a role speaks volumes of its astute foreign policy and high level of policy capacity. \"More than simply being an event organiser, Singapore has also shown how small states can play the role of peacemakers, simply by fostering strong bilateral relations with all parties and helping to bring conflicting partners together when needed,\" said Assistant Professor Woo, who is with the NTU's public policy and global affairs programme. Said Ambassador-at-Large Ong Keng Yong: \"Foreign countries and leaders that matter to Singapore are familiar with what Singapore can do or cannot do. Where there was any doubt, the Trump-Kim Singapore summit has clearly demonstrated our ability and capability.\" \"What has happened with the Trump-Kim summit is that the relevance of Singapore as an important place in the world of politics, economy and human development has been reaffirmed and strengthened.\" \"This is very valuable for us, as we have today new geopolitical and technological dynamics around the globe, and the growing assumption is that the 20th-century architecture and institutions are not relevant anymore,\" said Mr Ong, who is also the executive deputy chairman of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). He added that it should not be taken for granted that other countries will accept Singapore's role hitherto without envy and resistance. Indeed, while Singapore's reputation as a neutral party and honest broker has been enhanced, it cannot afford to be complacent on the international stage. But in the short term, at least, there are potential benefits in the form of an enhanced reputation and soft power, as well as attention from the Trump administration. In the longer run, there may be access to economic opportunities in North Korea. The S$20 million cost of staging the event, observers noted, was a strategic bet that may yield substantial dividends in the future. The meeting last Tuesday (Jun 12), which lasted more than five hours, yielded little by way of hard commitments, but in terms of substance, it was difficult to understate its importance: The net effect was of walking both sides away from a possible conflict. Experts and commentators noted that Pyongyang won several concessions, the biggest of which was the suspension of war games between the US and South Koreans, a goal it has long sought. READ: A commentary on how Kim Jong Un may have outmanoeuvred Donald Trump in Singapore.  READ: US-North Korea summit ends without marquee achievement, but wasn't a waste, a commentary. In turn, Mr Trump has confidently stated that North Korea no longer poses a nuclear threat, while American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hopes to see signs of \"major disarmament\" by the North within 2.5 years - that is, by the end of the current administration's first term in office. NEUTRAL, HONEST BROKER Singapore has a record of hosting sensitive and high-profile political meetings, and this would not have been possible without an even-handed and omni-directional foreign policy. Some of the high-profile events that come to mind include the 2015 meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and then Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, as well as the 1993 meeting between then Straits Exchange Foundation chairman Koo Chen-fu and his Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan. The Wang-Koo meeting was the first official meeting since 1949 to occur between the two sides. Professor Tan See Seng, deputy director of the RSIS' Institute for Defence and Strategic Studies, noted that Singapore has long been seen and endorsed by others as a state that can play, and has played, the role of an honest broker or moderator. He said: It is not just the hosting of summits of this sort, but, equally, the informal mediating role that Singapore has sought to play in the past, say, between China and the US or between China and Taiwan. Notably, Singapore did not offer to host the meeting - that was decided by the two sides, and then presented to Singapore, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said earlier. \"We did not put our hand up, but we were asked. And in this case, both the North Koreans and the US felt that we were an appropriate venue,\" he said. \"I think Singaporeans can be proud. Proud that we've been chosen because they know that we are neutral, reliable, trustworthy and secure,\" he added. Analysts said the venue for the Trump-Kim talks had to be in a country with diplomatic relations with both North Korea and the US, and few countries met the condition. Switzerland, Mongolia and the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas were among the locations initially considered. The Republic's ties with the US are deep and wide-ranging, and span the gamut from defence to the economic. North Korea recognised Singapore's independence in 1967, and an embassy was established in the Republic in the 1970s. Although Singapore has implemented sanctions against North Korea in line with the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions, it has also made it a point to keep lines of communications open with the reclusive regime. Dr Kei Koga of the NTU's public policy and global affairs programme said that given Singapore's foreign policy approach of maintaining neutrality when dealing with the major powers, it has gained a reputation of being trustworthy. \"It is generally difficult for any country to be trusted by both the US and North Korea, and thus far, Singapore's foreign policy has been successful in nurturing this type of soft power,\" he said. This trust was put to good use before the June 12 event, with Dr Balakrishnan making whirlwind eve-of-summit trips to Washington and then Pyongyang to tie down the details. This was crucial, said NTU's Asst Prof Woo. In doing so, he was able to gain a closer understanding of the two parties' positions, as well as establish closer ties between Singapore and the two nations. But there was much more to do. Mr Ong, the Ambassador-at-Large, said: \"Since we are such a world-class facility and have a good reputation to uphold, our five-star service involved us reaching out to ascertain what each of the summit participants would actually require, and then to ensure a pleasant stay for them in Singapore.\" He added that given the threat of terrorism, \"nothing could be left to chance\". Around 5,000 Home Team officers, backed by nearly 2,000 personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces who were deployed with live ammunition and across a variety of assets, ensured that the security operation went without a hitch. OTHER BENEFITS FOR SINGAPORE With the summit — and the frenzy in the days leading to it — streamed live on mobile phones and beamed into living rooms across the globe, the world's eyes were on Singapore. The smooth conclusion of the meeting boosted the country's already strong reputation globally as a safe and secure place, said observers. Singapore Management University (SMU) law lecturer Eugene Tan said Singapore fared relatively well - the event was safe and secure, and things went smoothly. There were no major hiccups, the security of the two leaders and their delegations was never compromised, and traffic snarls and security checks were not deeply disruptive, he added. But while Singapore is already world-famous for its level of public safety, and its diplomacy has a glowing reputation within the global community, there were other factors that led to it being the choice for the summit. Assoc Prof Tan believes strict laws governing protests and the country's ability to put in place a no-nonsense public-order framework quickly may have been key. \"Both leaders would chafe at the prospect of being the subject of protests while in Singapore,\" he said. It is precisely because Singapore is uber-orderly and secure that she is attractive and acceptable to both the US and North Korea as host for talks of such a sensitive and delicate nature. Strict public-order laws meant the two leaders were unlikely to encounter major security threats or be embarrassed by demonstrations in the streets, allowing them to focus on the substance of their talks, he added. Before and during the summit, the authorities were quick to quash any sign of disaffection. It was reported last week that five South Korean women arrested near the St Regis Singapore hotel — where Mr Kim was putting up — were deported with a stern warning. Another group of South Koreans held up banners near the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island, where the summit took place, demanding that the remaining hostages from the Korean War be freed. They were advised by police against protesting and left the area. Beyond an affirmation of its ability to keep order amid intense global scrutiny, hosting the summit burnished Singapore's reputation in other ways. Mr Curtis Chin, a former US Ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, said: It signalled that Singapore is doing the right thing when it comes to how it is addressing its own interests, but is also trying to be a positive contributor to the region, and in this case, the world. \"The Trump-Kim summit reaffirms Singapore's nature as a small but mighty nation that can contribute in a way that goes well beyond its size,\" Mr Chin, who is Asia fellow with non-profit think-tank Milken Institute, added. Mr Ong, the veteran diplomat, said there is also \"bonus\" for the Republic: Better ties with both countries in the future. \"Even though we could not get into the substantive agenda of the summit, we made friends individually. Otherwise, how can a little red dot get so close and so much airtime in the powerhouses in Washington DC and Pyongyang?\" he said. Dr Euan Graham, director of the international security programme at think-tank Lowy Institute, said the summit should have earned Singapore \"some valuable credit with the Trump administration, given that Southeast (Asia) must compete with other parts of the Indo-Pacific region for attention, and (with) Singapore's status as a close security partner rather than a treaty ally\". On the North Korean front, Mr Kim was quoted by his country's state media as saying he was impressed by Singapore's economic development and hoped he could learn from the country during a night tour of some downtown landmarks on Monday. SMU's Assoc Prof Tan said Singapore could have set Mr Kim thinking about the possible models for his country, given the young leader's limited exposure to the world. \"The blend of market-economy capitalism and strict political control could also be an instructive lesson for North Korea as it takes very tentative steps in embarking on an early, cautious rapprochement with the global community,\" he said. As Mr Kim took in the sights in town, Singapore's style of government may well have been an eye-opener to him, said Assoc Prof Tan. \"It's a system that is relatively open to the world for trade, investments, people and ideas, while having a communitarian, no-nonsense democratic system.\" SINGAPORE SHINES … BUT AT WHAT COST? As always with Singaporeans, however, euphoria is often tempered with grumbling, and the summit was no different. The S$20 million figure, in particular, caught the attention of many. While most defended the spending, there were some who argued against spending such a large sum without direct benefits for Singaporeans. Much of the debate was on social media, but on the ground, too, some Singaporeans shared similar sentiments. For example, a food-delivery rider who only wanted to be known as Arvin, 53, said: \"We're not involved in the fight. Why must we spend money for them?\" However, observers said the money was well spent. Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian from NUS' Department of Political Science said the Republic's S$20 million investment was a \"strategic bet\" on the summit turning out well and leading to further progress on the decades-long differences between the US and North Korea. Ms Anwita Basu, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit, pointed out that the S$20 million bill was a \"minuscule amount\" of the budgeted expenditure for 2018. \"Not only has this delivered significant soft power for Singapore, but it has also been a celebration of the country's spectacular infrastructure and security capabilities,\" she added. Mr Ong said the bill was \"certainly worthwhile\". \"We cannot see the sum of S$20 million as overspending. In fact, much of the money pays the regular salaries of all the personnel engaged in the work for the summit,\" he said. \"A wise man from India once told me, 'You want money, you spend money. And please, no money, no talk'\". He added: “I am now more concerned about how to say ‘no’ to other requests (for Singapore to host major events). What is the key consideration for the Singapore Government to draw a line? Is it beneficial to our country to host other summits, and if we do not host, what harm will that bring to Singapore?” Amid the congratulatory mood and the euphoric glow after the summit, however, Assoc Prof Tan sounded a cautionary note. All the effort and money would ultimately amount to little if success meant that Singaporeans think the country has \"arrived in terms of our foreign policy, our neutrality and how others view us\". \"We should not get ahead of ourselves and imagine that Singapore's soft power is so influential,\" he said. \"We have to continue to further develop an international reputation for neutrality … We are some way off from being known as robustly neutral like Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries like Norway,\" he said, adding that the Republic has been perceived as being pro-US. \"We still have some way to go in terms of our international standing and the evolution of our soft power,\" he added. \"The quest for relevance on the world stage has to be in our DNA, and we have to strive towards that on our own terms, defined by our own values and identity.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/trump-kim-summit-real-value-is-in-affirming-singapore-place-10442788"}, {"datetime": "19 Jun 2018 12:04AM", "tags": ["Asian Games", "Singapore National Olympic Council", "Football Association of Singapore", "Myanmar"], "author": "Nigel Chin", "title": "Football: Singapore U-23 side vow to go all out to prove their worth against Myanmar", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Under-23 national team are raring to prove themselves worthy of a place in the Asian Games, even if a victory over Myanmar on Wednesday (Jun 20) could eventually prove futile. The game, which will be played at Bishan Stadium at 8pm, is the only chance for the team to impress the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and justify their inclusion in the Asian Games.  Irfan Fandi, the Singapore team's 21-year-old captain, said: \"I expect everybody to play their best. There's no excuses to be off-form, because these are the players that were chosen - the best U-23 players in Singapore - so we have to give our best on Wednesday, including myself.\"  Zulfadhmi Suzliman acknowledged that Myanmar are tough opponents - the squad made the U-20 World Cup in 2015 - but he believes that the Singapore team have a \"desire to win\".  \"I can see the boys are working hard, and are willing to go all out ... it's not going to be an easy game, and we will definitely need to work as a team. We really need this win,\" the 22-year-old forward said.  The Football Association of Singapore's (FAS) nomination for the team to compete in the Asian Games was rejected last month, as the results put forward by the FAS did not meet SNOC's criteria.  To meet the selection criteria and be included in the Singapore contingent, the team have to match the top-six result at a previous Asian Games, or beat opponents ranked at least sixth in Asia.  Prior to the announcement, the Singapore U-23's only result this year was a 3-0 friendly defeat to Indonesia in March.  The FAS subsequently told Channel NewsAsia earlier this month that they were struggling to find an opponent because of a lack of dates. The match against Myanmar was only announced last Wednesday. While Myanmar are ranked 27th in the region, and they also did not compete in the last Asian Games in 2014, the FAS believes that the current Myanmar squad is one of the best in the region. Apart from their World Cup qualification, they also reached the 2014 Asian Football Confederation U-19 Championship semi-finals. TEAM HINDERED BY CONSTRAINTS Still, the Singapore camp's preparation hasn't been the best one.  The full squad will have just one training session together on Tuesday due to their exertions in the Singapore Premier League. Coach Fandi Ahmad admitted that it will be a \"very big task\" for them.  \"Everybody is excited to play in an international game but the players haven't trained much together. It will be all about the desire ... We (the coaches) have to try and make them play as hard as they can, to show they are good enough to play football and good enough to represent the country,\" he said.  Fandi admitted that he is also wary of putting too much pressure on his young players.  \"I won't tell them this is a qualifier. I will say 'do your best, this is your country, it's an honour and you have to give your best'. It's all about the mentality they display,\" he said.  \"Playing in the Asian Games will help them to gain more experience, and it's good to gain exposure, but we can only do it with preparation.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-singapore-u23-myanmar-asian-games-impress-snoc-10444356"}, {"datetime": "18 Jun 2018 09:25PM", "tags": ["entertainment", "JJ Lin"], "author": "", "title": "JJ Lin adds additional Singapore concert dates, tickets to go on sale Jun 25", "content": " SINGAPORE: Tickets for Singaporean Mandopop star JJ Lin's additional Singapore concerts will go on sale on Jun 25 at 10am, concert organiser Unusual Entertainment announced on Monday (Jun 18).

The amount claimed makes the scam the biggest of its kind so far. The syndicate’s activities came to light after 13 insurance companies lodged separate police reports on fraudulent claims for 21 accidents that happened between May 2011 and Oct 2013, according to court documents.  Among the victims were NTUC Income, Aviva and Liberty Insurance. Sollihin was charged in June 2014. While out on bail, he called others involved in the scam to ask them not to admit to anything. His sentence was based on 55 of 203 charges brought against him, mainly for cheating and perverting the course of justice. The other charges were taken into consideration.  On Monday, Sollihin appeared in court accompanied by 15 family members, who were seen to be in tears.  MODUS OPERANDI WAS TO STAGE ACCIDENTS USING VEHICLES NEEDING REPAIR The syndicate's modus operandi was to stage accidents using vehicles that had been sent in to Sollihin's or his associate’s workshop on Bukit Merah Lane. In exchange, they offered free repairs and paintwork to drivers who were willing to allow their vehicles to be used in staged accidents. More than 80 people have been convicted as part of the same case, including phantom drivers and passengers. The prosecution said Sollihin played multiple roles that were “pivotal” to the scheme.  In asking for him to be sentenced to nine years in jail, the prosecution said: “Fraudulent claims have a direct impact on the general insurance premiums payable by all motorists in Singapore, in addition to being hard to detect and economically unfeasible to challenge.”  Sollihin’s lawyer Kalidass Murugaiyan, however, sought a maximum of six years in jail for his client, saying that Sollihin is “far from being the mastermind of the offences”. Instead, his role was to coordinate the offences on behalf of the “actual mastermind”, he said in mitigation.  He added that Sollihin has given the police details of the purported “actual mastermind” who has not been apprehended.  Rahmat Mohd, described as Sollihin’s right hand man, was in 2016 jailed for six years and two months.  Rahmat was in charge of recruiting phantom drivers and passengers, or instigating the drivers to plant passengers in their vehicles to make more fraudulent claims. The two met in 2011 when Sollihin was a freelance despatch driver.  For his cheating offences, Sollihin could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined. For obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating course of justice, he could have been jailed up to seven years, fined or both. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mastermind-motor-insurance-scam-staged-accidents-sollihin-anhar-10443334"}, {"datetime": "18 Jun 2018 06:40PM", "tags": ["Bomb threat", "Parliament House", "SOC"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Man who sent fake bomb threats to Parliament House and police unit is jailed for 6 months", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 46-year-old man who sent letters saying “bomb inside” to Parliament House and the Special Operations Command (SOC) in Queensway in April this year was on Monday (Jun 18) sentenced to six months in jail.   Albert Pang, a part-time waiter at that time, was “unhappy about certain political issues in Singapore and thus he wanted to create chaos”, according to court documents.

It was only after he received a mass broadcast message on his mobile phone that he realised there had been an earthquake. At least three people were killed - including a nine-year-old girl - and more than 300 injured after a strong quake rocked Osaka in western Japan during the morning rush hour. The Japanese meteorological agency originally put the quake's magnitude at 5.9 but later raised it to 6.1. \"We woke up early to catch the Shinkansen to Kyoto for a day trip,\" the 46-year-old told Channel NewsAsia.\"Two minutes into the journey, there was a violent shaking of the train and it stopped.\" Said Dr Chee: \"I thought it was a power failure at first, as everyone else was so calm on the train. We couldn't understand what was happening until a mass broadcast message was received (on) my mobile, telling us to keep calm and take shelter.\" \"Only then it dawned upon us - it was an earthquake!\" The train doors were locked, said Dr Chee. \"We took the cue from the locals and all stayed in the train.\" The train eventually continued on to Kyoto, said the father of two, adding that they spent \"a good four hours\" on board. From there, the family took a taxi back to their hotel in Osaka to retrieve their luggage and passports as all the trains were down, according to Dr Chee. Although they had planned to stay in Osaka until Wednesday, the family decided to cut short their visit and take a flight to Tokyo instead.  \"The city (Osaka) is functioning as normal, except trains were all down and taxis were hard to come by,\" he said. \"We decided to still leave as aftershocks are expected and it would be more relaxing to continue our holidays further away from the earthquake\". \"I COULD HEAR AND FEEL THE TREMBLING\" Singaporean postgraduate student Benny Tong was at home in Sakai, just south of Osaka, when the earthquake happened while he was about to prepare his breakfast. \"There was first quite intense rattling for about 20 seconds, and I could hear and feel the trembling of the house and furniture. Then the ground shook and swayed quite dramatically for about a minute,\" the 32-year-old told Channel NewsAsia. \"I steadied myself under a door frame in case the house collapsed, but thankfully nothing too bad happened.\" \"I could see the overhead electricity cables outside my house shake quite a lot.\" He had received a \"loud emergency alarm\" from his phone when the tremors started, added Mr Tong. \"This is the countrywide alert system that Japan has for all of its mobile phones. That was how I immediately realised it was an earthquake.\" Mr Tong was in Japan visiting his fiancee and her family until August, and said he usually went \"every half a year or so, for a month or two each time\". He said he had experienced a few minor earthquakes before in Osaka, but that Monday's was \"the first time I felt one as big as this\". \"People are generally calm now,\" he said. \"I was able to contact my Japanese friends and family through phone, Facebook and other messaging apps, and confirm that we are all safe and sound.\" Most major organisations such as universities had cancelled work for the day, he said, adding that most train lines had also suspended operations. Another Singaporean, Mr Luis Hoon Ding Yuan, similarly told Channel NewsAsia that Monday's earthquake was not the worst he had experienced in the country. The 32-year-old SAP system analyst, who lives in Kyoto with his wife who is Japanese, said he was at home taking out the rubbish when the earthquake happened. \"Everything was the same before the quake, and then the ground started shaking,\" he said. \"After the quake, a few items toppled in my kitchen and my living room. My TV was intact though.\" \"There were slight tremors, but (they were) almost unfeelable,\" he added. \"It was not the worst I felt. I had an even worst experience in Tokyo though.\" Meanwhile, a Japanese mother-of-three who lives in Osaka told Channel NewsAsia that this was her third big earthquake experience and that she was now stocking up on supplies. “I lived through the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.

Russia accounted for 88 per cent of the attacks against Singapore on Jun 12 - the day both leaders met, F5 Labs and its data partner Loryka said in a Jun 14 blog post.  In addition, of all the attacks originating from Russia, 97 per cent of these targeted Singapore, the blog post said.  Going deeper into the data, F5 Labs said approximately 40,000 attacks were launched between 11pm (3pm UTC) on Jun 11 and 8pm (12pm UTC) on Jun 12.  It added that 92 per cent of the attacks collected were reconnaissance scans looking for vulnerable devices while the remaining 8 per cent were \"exploits\", which take advantage of vulnerabilities. The top attack destination port was the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) port 5060, which is an Internet Protocol phone protocol.  \"It is unusual to see port 5060 as a top attack destination port.

Including ECs, 1,257 units were sold in May, a drop from the 1,328 sold the previous month and 1,416 homes sold in May last year. \"The buying momentum is healthy because developers managed to sell more units in May and the number of units sold is greater than the number of units launched,\" said ZACD Group executive director Nicholas Mak. \"There has been a gradual increase in the number of units launched by developers over the last few months ... The good thing is that the market is still able to absorb the number of units launched,\" Mr Mak said. In May, developers launched 1,060 units, up 60 per cent from April and 186 per cent from May last year. The Outside Central Region proved most popular with both buyers and developers last month, with 834 units launched and 792 homes sold. This compares with the 56 and 170 units launched in the Core Central Region and Rest of Central Region, respectively. In terms of sales, 43 units were sold in the Core Central Region and 286 homes in the Rest of Central Region. Mr Mak said that with several more projects lined up to hit the market in the coming months, developers will be looking to pace out the timing of the launches. \"Looking ahead there will be several more projects that are lined up for launch. One of the important factors is to avoid head-on competition with their fellow developers; what they will do is likely pace out the launches,\" Mr Mak said. Mr Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty Network, noted that sales of new private homes could dip in June before rising again. \"Developer sales numbers will likely dip in June, as it the school holidays and buying demand is seasonally weaker,\" Mr Lim said. \"Post June, we are expecting buying demand to increase again as several major developments are set to be launched,\" he added.

The labs house various centres that work on addressing the health concerns of Singaporeans including effective treatment, early prevention and health management.    Dr Khor noted the rising importance of population health management, given the shifting demographics.  “By 2030, we expect the number of seniors aged 65 and above to double to 900,000. With many living longer, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are rising sharply,” she said. Dr Khor added that there is an “urgent need” to move beyond just disease management to improving the health of the entire Singapore population.  “The launch of LKCMedicine’s Population and Community Health Laboratories is timely as Singapore earnestly prepares for our rapidly ageing population,\" she said. \"The research conducted in these laboratories will improve chronic disease prevention and management, and help people to lead healthier lives for longer.\"  The venue is made up of a centre for population health sciences, as well as one for primary healthcare research and innovation. There is also an exercise medicine and physiology laboratory.   It is also home to the clinical research centre, which has already embarked on a 20-year in-depth study called Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS). Led by LKCMedicine Professor of Cardiovascular Epidemiology John Chambers, it  aims to assess the health of Singaporeans to better predict and prevent chronic diseases.  The study commenced in July 2017 and 800 Singaporeans and permanent residents aged between 30 to 84 have been recruited to provide their health data. It aims to assess over 10,000 people in the first phase of the study over the next 18 months (until end-2019). Professor Chambers said the data will identify the genetic and environmental factors that underpin the development of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and other complex diseases affecting Singaporeans.  “It’s the first comprehensive large-scale study of its kind in Singapore. Participants also benefit as they will get a personal health report and find out their health status and what’s important to them on an individual level,” he said.

Md Gias Uddin Sarker was convicted on five counts of outrage of modesty at the end of a seven-day trial.  The court heard the victim took up the job at Gias’ company, which deals with the import and export of medical devices as well as construction, despite reservations about him. Before she took up the job, the victim, who had met Gias before, said he felt he looked at her in a “perverted way”, according to court documents. However, her mother said Gias was a “good and trustworthy man”. On her first day working in the administrative department at Gias’ company on Nov 20, 2015, the victim ran errands with him, including meeting up with an auditor and getting security bonds for workers. They then proceeded to Gias’ office in Woodlands Link in the evening. The victim said the surroundings of the office were deserted and secluded, with no one in sight, the court heard. It also appeared to be hard to access, with no bus-stop in sight. GIAS TOOK VICTIM TO HIS ROOM TO SHOW HER HOW TO DO HER WORK When they were in the office, Gias showed the victim a room full of ropes and metals for construction work. They then went to his office, where they first discussed her work arrangements and salary. Then, Gias told her he wanted to show her how to make entries to worker payroll timesheets on his computer desktop, and asked her to sit on his right. First he put his hand over hers on the computer mouse. He also spoke about his personal life, the court heard. He said he loved his wife and children, and was not looking for “hot sex” like other men, and said he would give the victim extra money, cosmetics and clothes on top of her salary. Then, Gias touched the victim’s shoulder. She told him she was not comfortable and moved backwards. He then returned to talking about the payroll timesheets, but placed his hand on her back and then molested her. At this point, the victim said she was frozen, stunned, scared and in a state of disbelief, the court heard. While wanting to escape, the victim was afraid of what the man might do, especially after she had seen the ropes and metals. She told him she wanted to go home, but he said she had to wait as there were workers who would be arriving to see him. When three Bangladeshi men arrived, she thought of seeking help from them, but dismissed the idea for fear that the matter might escalate. The victim then said she needed to use the toilet, and went to try and get help. She saw that it was dark outside and that there was a group of men across the street, and no vehicles in sight. When she returned to the office, she told Gias that she could not get into the toilet, and that she wanted to go home. He then followed her to the toilet and waited for her outside. GIAS TOLD VICTIM NOT TO TELL ANYONE WHAT HAPPENED The victim’s ordeal continued after that. When she returned to the room and the chair, Gias touched her thigh, then hugged her around the shoulder. The victim returned the hug slightly, as she did not want to anger him and escalate things, the court heard. When he hugged her a second time and she did not return it, he commanded her to do so in a stern voice. He also pinched her cheeks and hugged her again before leaving the office. He told her not to tell anyone what happened, and gave her S$200 in salary for the day. Each time he did something and she told him she was not comfortable, he justified his actions saying they were “family”. Eventually, the victim left the building with Gias at about 9.30pm, and the two of them shared a taxi. This time, when Gias touched her thigh, the victim told him off. She felt safe in the taxi driver’s presence, the court heard. The victim told her husband, a CISCO auxiliary police officer, what happened. He confronted Gias that night itself. Gias denied touching the victim. The next day, the victim and her husband lodged a police report. VICTIM’S RELATIONSHIP WITH MOTHER AFFECTED The prosecution said in its closing submissions that there was overwhelming evidence in the case - the victim’s internally and externally consistent testimony, corroborative testimonies from witnesses, and the “accused’s incredulous and vacillating version of events”. The prosecution also said the victim is a “victim of truth and gave compelling, logical and unwavering account of the incidents”. Following the incident, the victim was afraid to go to her mother’s house, as Gias lived near her mother, and had problems being intimate with her husband and had trust issues. She told the court that she would cry and have an emotional breakdown every time she thought about what happened, and felt that her relationship with her mother was affected, as she partly blamed her for what happened. Gias is appealing the conviction and the sentence, and is out on bail. For his offences, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or received a combination of these punishments.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-molested-employee-on-her-first-day-of-work-gets-8-months-10442626"}, {"datetime": "18 Jun 2018 12:32PM", "tags": [], "author": "Gwyneth Teo", "title": "Regional ferry operators to provide better lifejackets by end-2019", "content": " SINGAPORE: As part of a new initiative to improve safety at sea, regional ferry operators will be required to provide better lifejackets by the end of 2019, Singapore’s maritime authorities said on Monday (Jun 18). The current lifejackets, which have strings that need to be tied, are prone to user error and depend on the user to tie them tightly in order to be effective, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said. They will be replaced with buckle-type lifejackets, which are easier and faster to put on in an emergency, MPA said. The new lifejackets also come with a whistle and light, similar to the lifejackets found on aircraft. Instead of storing lifejackets in plastic bags, customised metal receptacles will be placed under passenger seats to protect the lifejacket from damage and make it faster for passengers to retrieve one. The MPA will set aside up to S$800,000 for a co-funding scheme to help ferry operators defray the cost of buying new lifejackets and upgrading their storage receptacles. MPA chief executive Andrew Tan said the move will help ensure standardisation in the industry. \"Whenever incidents occur, there is risk to the environment, property, and lives,\" said Mr Tan. \"The incidents over the years are a reminder that we cannot take things for granted.

Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose 15.5 per cent in May from a year earlier, data from the trade agency Enterprise Singapore showed, accelerating from an 11.8 per cent surge the month before.

Born from 1979 to 2000, they are the next generation leaders and some say, the most creative and innovative we have seen. Millennial-led companies, including some notably with Singaporean founders or Singapore-based, such as Razer, Carousell, RedMart, and Grab, have demonstrated an impressive ability to champion disruption, leverage technology and attract talent. These companies threaten the notion of working for traditional and institutional companies that have been part of our social fabric for decades. Clearly, attracting millennial talent is key to enterprise success. And what can organisations with heritage do to learn from start-ups and shake up the “oldness and outdated” perception? READ: A commentary what a digital workforce of tomorrow looks like. ASPIRATION, THAT LOFTY IDEA MILLENNIALS CHAMPION Millennials care about social impact and a greater contribution to the world. From Deloitte’s Millennial Survey 2017, more than 50 per cent of 8,000 respondents say they feel accountable for social issues related to environmental protection and social equality. This level of social consciousness may have arisen out of exposure to issues through social media amplification and peer influence. But it also suggests that millennials care deeply about the world around them and want to be able to effect positive change in the roles they undertaken. For e-commerce start-up Carousell which has raised more than S$100 million in funding and count the likes of Sequoia Capital and Rakuten as investors, co-founder Quek Siu Rui describes what success means to him. For me, success is less about making a billion dollars. It’s really about the ability to build products and services that could potentially benefit and help a billion people. So to attract millennials, it seems organisations can no longer rely on a beautifully crafted vision statement or worse still, solely exist to achieve business objectives. Millennials expect their managers to care; and are genuinely interested and concerned about a higher purpose, one that transcend profits and business goals. To attract millennials, organisations will, more than ever, need to examine how they can envision and contribute to a future that is larger than their own. MILLENNIALS DEMAND INSPIRATIONAL LEADERS Millennials want to be inspired and engaged at the workplace. For many, this may connotate popular practices and benefits made famous by leading companies such as Google including dress-down days, bring your own devices (BYOD), catered lunches and flexible work arrangements. While more progressive workplace practices do create buzz and are great employer branding tools, there must be a more profound, inner motivation that attracts millennials. READ  A commentary on why a nice office alone won’t attract millennials to your company. Millennials believe they deserve to be led by someone they can look up to. So ensuring that organisations develop and promote strong leaders, who are also role models who will develop their people, is an imperative. While other generations also desire to work for good leaders, millennials expect it.  Based on research by Mercer, a leading HR consultancy, which studied data collected from 600,000 employees in 43 organisations, “transformational leaders” positively influence career confidence and work-life satisfaction, factors that millennials pay attention to. Transformational or inspirational leaders, exemplify a unique style of workplace leadership that focuses on articulating the bigger picture, providing clarity on work priorities, building trust and commitment, actively listening and communicating, and galvanising team effort. Start-ups have that advantage as founders innately demonstrate vision and a very high level of commitment and work ethic to succeed – because their start-up’s survival is at stake. In one interview, Razer CEO Tan Min Liang explained: “It’s easy to say (you want to create great products), but the proof is in the pudding when you dedicate your life to it.” In turn, this creates a positive and enabling work culture through a common goal, something which millennials are drawn to in a start-up environment. So how can organisations build this “founder’s mindset” in managers? It starts with the top management’s commitment to role model the right behaviours and treat the organisation as if it were their own business.   Instead of dismissing leadership development as a business cost or good to have, organisations need to invest, just like education, to build that leadership capability as a talent magnet. Consequently, organisations need to examine if they are truly committed and will hold their managers accountable for exemplifying inspirational leadership to attract, motivate and retain talent. CREATING NEW VALUE DRIVES MILLENNIALS Millennials thrive by creating something they can call their own. It is their way of projecting contribution and success. And the beauty of a start-up is the entrepreneurial environment, which aggressively encourages ideas to flow and people from all background to contribute, an attribute which millennials value. For many organisations which have scaled business sizably, this entrepreneurial environment is somewhat elusive as business processes and systems kick-in and it becomes a higher priority to drive efficiency and optimisation. Many organisations are potentially at risk of losing the edge in new value creation if they do not invest in platforms where everyone, regardless of hierarchy, experience or age, can initiate ideas, insights and action. The key question is how can organisations attract and tap on millennial talent to create new business value? Requiring a high level of humility and curiosity to learn from others, managers need to start thinking about promoting an open work culture that embraces diversity of perspectives. This is a belief that resonates with millennials. At Shiseido, with 146 years of heritage, this importance is encapsulated in the concept of “multi-value creation” and promoting a culture that encourages people to “love the differences”. Going beyond acknowledging the need for diversity, it is about developing and sharing expertise, sponsoring an open ecosystem for colleagues to embrace different values, blend ideas and create new value propositions as part of innovation. RAISING THE BAR Talent is never going to just walk through the door. If organisations are to excel against start-ups to attract millennial talent, they need to do more than enhance branding, compensation and workplace practices. They can start by developing better leaders and creating that vision that will benefit society. David Pang is chief of staff at Shiseido Travel Retail.  READ: A commentary on work-life balance.

Parents who are concerned about getting their children into popular schools next year are, no doubt, bracing themselves for the exercise. Those who are alumni of popular schools often feel they can rest easy. However, the process often invites the opprobrium of those who don’t have connections to such schools. But since 2014, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been setting aside at least 40 places in every primary school for children without a prior connection. From 2019, all affiliated secondary schools will have to reserve 20 per cent of their Secondary One places for incoming students who do not have any affiliation priority. No doubt, this in turn causes some stress for those with connections who might feel like they will have to compete for fewer places.  As such, perhaps we need to reconsider what constitutes a good school and whether all this stress is warranted.  Reasonably, we can’t expect public policy to meet the specific desires of each and every citizen. However, it could at least be aligned, in this case, with the larger Singapore narrative of justice, equality and meritocracy.  PRIVILEGE AND SOCIAL CAPITAL STILL PLAY A PART In this context, we should note that prior connections remain part of the equation, albeit to a lesser extent.  P1 registration is taken seriously because the advantages that those with alumni connections have don’t end at the primary school level. The issue arises again if their desired secondary school has an affiliated primary school. In spite of recent changes, some parents still report losing a place at schools nearest to their homes to those who live much farther away - simply because those children have alumni connections. Considering the vital discussions Singaporeans have been having lately about inequality, privilege and social mobility, perhaps prior connections should not be a factor in school admissions at any level. READ: Can education fix inequality in Singapore? READ: Are we missing the point of education? THE ALTERNATIVE? Of course, if changes to the system are made, alternatives would need to be put in place. So, how should entrance to primary school be determined? Over the years, we’ve heard suggestions such as a pure ballot-based system or even a pure proximity-based admissions process.  Schools in wealthier neighbourhoods would generally be populated only by students from wealthier families. We are already seeing unintended consequences insofar as the high demand for places in top schools can result in rising property prices in the vicinity. Some parents have moved just to be near a school. And others have apparently abused the system by lying about their addresses to help their child get into a popular school.  In many cases, qualified and deserving students living in less affluent areas may have to travel a longer distance to these schools. Therefore, many end up not going there.  This would not be an issue if every school was seen as a “good” school - and if all of us believed it. It is the competition for places in particular schools that leads to angst and arguments over admissions criteria.  Our definition of what is the definition of “good” needs to be broadened as well. It shouldn’t merely be brand-names or schools that accept students who do well in the PSLE, but should constitute well-resourced schools that can bring out the best in every child. READ:A commentary on parents' struggle in picking a 'good school' for their child. However, considering the status quo, at least the admissions process needs to be as equitable as possible. Perhaps the key to greater social mixing and mobility lies in ensuring a healthy residential mix of people from diverse backgrounds - something that the HDB is working on - and relocating popular schools so that everyone - including those from vulnerable backgrounds - have convenient geographical access to them. In this case, proximity-based admissions may not be tantamount to deepening social stratification. However, changes could go even deeper. Even priority admission to top primary and secondary schools for those from diverse socio-economic backgrounds misses part of the point.  Much has been said about wealthy families’ ability to afford tuition and other extra-curricular classes and courses, and how this gives children a leg up academically, and even when it comes to schemes such as the Direct School Admission programme.  No system should stop parents from investing in their children. But perhaps there should be greater recognition that kids from families which cannot afford such assistance could be on the backfoot in the classroom, and that any system should attempt to minimise inequalities. Financial assistance and bursary schemes for top secondary schools have been enhanced. The Government also aims to level the playing field from preschool in order to tackle inequality by doubling its annual spending on the preschool sector to S$1.7 billion in 2022. BEYOND EDUCATION But several researchers have pointed out that investment in education alone is insufficient to blunt the impact of privilege.  This is why the discussion could be widened beyond the narrow sphere of where our kids go to school and who gets to go to the ‘best’ ones. Family circumstances can affect a student's performance in school. In the case of low-income families for instance, if parents can't provide their child with permanent and stable housing, it could affect the child's study environment and in turn, affect his or her ability to do well in school.  Therefore, policies need to go beyond education to ensure that such children don't, in day-to-day living, suffer the effects of vast disparities that could unduly disadvantage them when compared to children from more privileged backgrounds.   Can the state do even more to diminish the disparities? Considering recent debates on social mobility and inequality, society might be ready for a deeper discussion on bolder changes to diminish the role that privilege plays in the success of future generations.

Time for a review of public housing policy", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore is frequently lauded when it comes to housing policy.  Its home ownership rate of more than 90 per cent of the population is one of the highest in the world and is much higher than the home ownership rates in developed countries.  Among developed urban centres like Seoul, Tokyo or Hong Kong, Singaporeans occupy a large per square foot per person of living space. Our public housing programme is well known for its quality of construction and design, including complementary amenities such as community centres, playgrounds, shops, sport facilities and so on.  While in most countries, public housing is meant for low-income households, in Singapore, it provides options for nearly all socio-economic classes. FROM THE SLUMS TO A HOME-OWNING SOCIETY In the 1950s, most of Singapore was living in slum-like, overcrowded conditions, with poor sanitation, safety standards and construction quality. Many lived in squatter settlements of attap, wood and zinc. Dysentery, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue thrived in these unsanitary and crowded living conditions. The fertility rate of the time was more than five children per woman versus the roughly one child per woman now, exacerbating the misery. When the People’s Action Party came to power in 1959, it made housing a high priority. Apart from the aforementioned reasons, the Government wanted to build a home-owning society where people felt they had a stake in the country and would work hard to contribute to society. The social stability it engendered also turned out to be a positive in attracting many multinationals to set up shop in Singapore, improving the economy of Singapore and the lives of people. The Housing Development Board (HDB) was set up in 1960. Within 10 years, the HDB housed 35 per cent of the population, and by the 1980s, 85 per cent of the population.  Housing quality also improved over the decades and by this century, many of the newer flats look little different physically from private apartments. OVER THE YEARS, INCREASING SUPPORT FOR SINGAPOREANS TO OWN A HOME By the late 1980s, housing security was mostly solved with home ownership hovering at around 90 per cent of the population from 1990 till present. Yet, policies to encourage home ownership did not let up.  From the late 1980s to mid 1990s, many policies were introduced to encourage home ownership, including the lifting of income and Central Provident Fund (CPF) restrictions for the purchase of HDB resale flats, allowing CPF savings to be used for private housing, and to pay for mortgage interest payments. During this time, the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme was introduced, as was the HDB upgrading programme. RETIREMENT ADEQUACY, PRESSURES ON PRICES, NEW EXPECTATIONS Commentaries, academic papers and organisations like the OECD and the International Monetary Fund have said that the use of CPF for housing has resulted in retirement inadequacy, with excessive withdrawals for housing at the expense of CPF balances at retirement.  In response to President Halimah Yacob’s recent call for bold ideas during the recent opening of Parliament, one economist even suggested that the CPF be restricted to no longer be used to pay for housing, seeing that housing prices may not rise indefinitely.  The high support for home ownership has given rise to expectations, with the Government now unfortunately bearing responsibility for any perceived negatives in our current housing, including housing prices, and receiving little praise for any positives.  This includes recent concerns around HDB 99-year leases, where many find the idea that a HDB flat value may depreciate as it runs down the lease to be unpalatable, even though the leasehold condition is well publicised. READ: Singapore's public housing policy has done its job splendidly, but it's time for a makeover, a commentary. READ: 99-year HDB leases a chance to review home ownership and retirement policies, a commentary. To compound issues, our population is ageing fast. By 2030, as much as one quarter of our resident population may be over 65, many of them living in larger-than-needed flats, as their children leave the nest or as their partner passes away.  If many choose to fund their retirement by monetising their houses, they may run into an oversupply of flats on the market, lowering resale prices. Addressing the 99-year leasehold issue or the retirement security issue without a cost to the home owner would effectively need a cross subsidy from future tax payers. Any changes to housing policy that impact prices would need to consider the fact that most voting Singaporeans have a vested interest in keeping house prices up. The continuous subsidy of housing in Singapore has been underpinned by the Land Acquisition Act of 1966, which had used historical cost for acquiring land, managing to keep new HDB flat prices low. In 1959, the State owned 44 per cent of all land, and by the mid-2000s, it was 85 per cent. Effectively, the Government redistributed land wealth from land owners to the rest of the population, aided by a growing economy supporting prices. This, however, cannot continue forever as housing leases start to run out, our economy slows, and our population ages. The Government had, over the decades since independence, resisted calls to liberally expand the social safety net, in order to avoid the development of an entitlement culture – that once you give someone something, you cannot easily take it back without antagonising that person, and you may end up with an intolerable burden for future generations. Yet, housing remains one social programme where much resources have been poured into. OVER-CONSUMPTION OF HOUSING You over-consume when that consumption is at the expense of something else without significantly increasing the satisfaction from that consumption. Despite CPF contribution rates hovering between 30 to 50 per cent for most of its existence, some older Singaporeans face retirement security issues.  Many say it’s our rising cost of living, but we should also consider what happens when we take out CPF to fund housing. A house is not just a shelter. It is also a leveraged financial asset. You are taking risk on both property prices and interest rates. Singapore’s rapid growth over the first 50 years from independence has led many people to believe that home ownership is a “sure win”, as house prices also rose from wage and population growth. Even then, we received a sobering lesson in the late-1990s, when housing prices crashed. We have only recovered to 1996 price levels in the last several years.  A slowing economy, resistance to immigration and an ageing population suggest that housing prices may not rise as astronomically in the future. The amount of capital that is not used for housing, can be invested in economic activities.  Pension funds in other countries invest in stock markets globally, private equity, fixed income, and other diversified investments that preserve wealth, improve retirement security, and encourage economic activity. Singaporeans score highly for assets, but it is mostly tied up in housing, insurance, CPF or bank deposits. Home ownership means mortgages for most. Having to service a mortgage can discourage risk-taking behaviour needed in entrepreneurship, in changing careers or in finding jobs overseas.  In the economy of the past, Singapore serviced manufacturing multinationals who needed reliable labour. In the economy of the future, we need to encourage risk-taking and a more fluid, adaptable labour market. TIME FOR A CHANGE IN HOUSING POLICY It is wonderful that Singaporeans can take for granted their housing security. We have essentially resolved the housing security problem since the 1990s.  A major benefit of housing security was social stability, which encouraged foreign investments, mostly in manufacturing. But do these drivers for our existing housing policy still exist today? It is my view that we should separate housing security from asset appreciation and recognise that we may be over-consuming housing at the expense of retirement adequacy, allocation of investments into economic activity, and inculcating desirable attitudes needed for a new economy. Housing policy needs to be reconsidered now while Singapore still has the time and the means to correct course, while catering to a class of existing home owners.

A basket of sweets – for passengers to help themselves to – was attached to the back of the driver’s seat, while a long green USB cord snaked from the plastic box in the car’s centre console, which my driver, Koo Kay Kee, invited me to use to charge my phone. But it was the large signs stuck on the back of the headrests that couldn’t be missed: It explained how passengers could, with a few taps on their phone, get items like mineral water, canned drinks, snacks or even free face mask samples from the repository of goodies housed in that very same plastic box that also allowed them to charge their phone. Grab&Go, a new initiative announced by Grab earlier this month, is a tie-up between the ride-hailing company and US-based in-car commerce start-up Cargo. It comes as Grab consolidates its position as the dominant ride-hailing service in Singapore, after announcing its acquisition of Uber's regional operations in March. Since then, Grab has also announced the launch of the GrabFood delivery service. For Grab&Go, drivers of private-hire cars equipped with the box of items will be able to supplement their income by taking a cut of each item sold to passengers from the box. As for passengers, it’s more or less a convenience store on the go. HOW DOES IT WORK?  It sounded like a win-win situation for both driver and passenger. But were there kinks to be ironed out, and did it really bring more convenience to passengers? I had to try it out for myself, which is where my ride with Mr Koo came in. He told me that he makes it a point to observe passengers when they first get into their car. “If they’re not busy staring at their phone, I’ll introduce the service to them,” he said. “Most of them say it’s quite innovative, and want to try it out because it’s a new experience for them.” And for the most part, the large, prominent signs did their job in piquing my curiosity. The printed instructions were also clear: Scan a QR code, and you’ll be taken to a site where you can see all the different products in the box that’re up for sale. Alternatively, you could go to a site and key in a unique five-digit code. Getting to the online menu of items was almost effortless. But the challenge, however, was scanning through the menu on the browser of my mobile phone, as the images shown could not be tapped into or expanded. There was also no description of the item for sale, and I had to rely on looking at only the pictures to make my selections. Nonetheless, I went ahead, selecting a can of Milo for S$1.40 and a Kellogg’s cereal bar that turned out to be a free sample. On Mr Koo’s recommendation, I also picked up a brightening face mask – yet another free sample. With a few taps on my phone, I confirmed that I would add S$1.40 to my fare. And as we slowed to a stop at a traffic light, Mr Koo’s phone beeped with a confirmation, and he turned around with a smile, opened the box and handed me my items. TO EAT, OR NOT TO EAT?  But if you’re feeling tempted to dig into your snacks right away, be warned: Grab doesn’t encourage passengers to eat or drink in the cars. And a sign pasted on the window of Mr Koo’s car also makes that clear to passengers. “No one really questions it,” he told me. “I think most people know that they’re not supposed to eat or drink in the car.” But in that case, I asked, why offer the sweets? In response, he smiled. “That one, okay lah.” On further questioning, Mr Koo explained that drivers are meant to hand over the items to passengers only at the end of the ride. “But whenever there’s an opportunity that I can stop the car and it’s safe, I’ll try to pass them the items.” Perhaps instant gratification is just another way Mr Koo tries to make his passengers happy. But drivers who wait still appear to see positive results from passengers – even those with hungry children.   “There was once I picked up a family of tourists, and there was a young child who was asking his mother for canned Milo and a box of Pocky biscuits,” said another driver, Sheila Koh. “When I dropped them off at their hotel and gave them their items, the child was so happy.” ​​​​​​​HAS IT BEEN WORKING?  Save for the few issues I faced, the box was an ingenious initiative, and a good way for passengers to score free samples of beauty products, or pick up a drink or snack if they know they'll need it later.  And the drivers I spoke to all agree that it's a great way for them to earn some passive income. Drivers earn 20 per cent commission for every paid sale and a S$1 bonus on every transaction, with the remainder going to Grab&Go. ​​​​​​​ Mr Koo, for example, has sold 28 items to passengers ever since he first got the box about three weeks ago. “And it’s still going strong,” he said. Ms Koh, similarly, says about half of the passengers she ferries daily will buy something from the box. “Customers think it’s really cool, and it’s a novelty for them,” she said. “So sometimes they just pick up a packet of Pocky biscuits, which is only 50 cents, just to see how it works.” But another driver, Eric Toh, has only made one sale from his box ever since he got it three weeks ago. “Most of my passengers seem to be busy with their phones,” he said with a rueful laugh. “And while some of them ask about the box, they don’t actually go to the website.” “But some of them are delighted to see there are free face masks available, and one of the passengers actually told me the free samples made their day!” The box, he stressed, is a “wonderful initiative” to supplement his income. But he said the entire initiative could do with more publicity. “It’s done through the Grab app, and through the signs and decals,” he said. “But I think passengers are either too occupied with their thoughts, or they’re too paiseh (embarrassed).” Publicity aside, drivers also hope that the variety of items for sale could be increased. And the top request from passengers, they say, is for chilled drinks to be sold. “I’ve sold mints, the Pocky biscuits and two tubes of Mentos sweets,” said Mr Koo. “But the canned drinks aren’t so popular…because they want chilled drinks. “Maybe that could be the next step.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/road-testing-the-grab-go-service-a-marketing-gimmick-or-a-win-10433298"}, {"datetime": "17 Jun 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["cna insider", "hari raya"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "Trust and respect: Why Muslim women are this home salon owner's biggest clients", "content": " SINGAPORE: Every two months, Madam Sarlin Ahmad travels about an hour and a half by bus and MRT train from her home in Woodlands to a home salon at Tampines, just to do her hair – even though there are plenty of decent salons near her place. The salon that she frequents, run by Winnie Lai, accepts only females. And it has found a pretty niche clientele – the more conservative Malay-Muslim women who prefer a private environment without men around.   “There is a market (for such salons) that are not open to public view. Some people are shy,” said Mdm Sarlin. “When we go to a salon outside, everyone knows what you’re doing. Here, they cannot see.” The salon is in Mdm Lai’s home, a HDB executive maisonette that looks just like any of the other flats along the quiet corridor. During the Hari Raya period, business gets especially brisk. Customers come seeking hair treatments, and many, like Mdm Sarlin, become such close friends that they even bring her their home-made kueh and biscuits to sample. Mdm Sarlin, for instance, brought the chocolate chip mint cookies she’d made, on a visit a few days before Hari Raya. “As long as it is food, she likes,” she told us, then asked Mdm Lai: “That time I brought the curry puff, nice right? And chicken pie.” But this time, the goodies came with an extra gift - a tube of slimming cream, which Mdm Sarin presented to an amused Mdm Lai.  “She asks me to slim down, but keeps bringing me food,” the 42-year-old hairstylist laughed. KNOWING WHAT THEY NEED Mdm Lai opened her home salon 11 years ago, in her then three-room flat. When she moved house, she converted part of her current flat to provide hairdressing services. A room near the entrance is closed off with a sliding door from the rest of the neat flat, affording both her family and her clients privacy. Inside is a small but professional setup of hairstyling chairs, steam machines and a shampoo chair. She accepts only female clients as she’s usually alone at home. These factors work out well for her Malay-Muslim customers, who make up half her clientele. “Some allow only female hairdressers to attend to them. The older ones, especially, prefer a salon with no men around,” said Mdm Lai in Mandarin. According to Mdm Sarlin, there are just a handful of women-only commercial salons, typically located in Geylang Serai and Kampong Glam. Clients who wear the tudung are more comfortable removing it in the privacy of her home salon, than in a commercial salon surrounded by others. Those who try her out end up recommending her to family and friends. Mdm Lai’s familiarity with the Malay language and culture stems from growing up in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. She left home for Singapore when she was 17, determined to learn the hairdressing trade Her first job at a commercial salon paid just S$500 to S$600 a month. “The working hours were very long, from 9am till 8pm,” she said. She worked for about 10 years before deciding to strike out on her own when she got pregnant. Her husband, an engineer who has to make business trips, suggested operating a salon at home so that she could be with their child. “Working at home, I can manage my time schedule. When you have children, it’s quite difficult to work for others,” she said. MEAGRE EARNINGS AT FIRST Under the Home-Based Small Scale Business Scheme, homeowners like Mdm Lai do not need the housing board’s approval to operate small-scale businesses – such as baking, hairdressing and sewing – in their flat. Conditions apply: These activities should be small-scale with no hiring of workers, and they should not cause disturbance or inconvenience to their neighbours. (HDB said it received a monthly average of three cases of “feedback” about such activities, from 2014 to 2016.) Mdm Lai admitted that she did have some reservations about starting a home salon. “Would the type of customers be any danger to me? Would there even be any customers at all?” Her first set-up in their old three-room flat was tough. The family had to give up one of two bedrooms for the salon, which made only S$600 to S$700 a month. Husband Steve Choong recalled: “The four of us squeezed into one room. The main sacrifice was space…and we did lose some privacy. The customers would be waiting around in the living room.” Not to be daunted though, he helped his wife market her business – by learning how to design flyers and personally distributing them. “Every day he would distribute flyers after work. It was very tough, to go to every block and every storey,” Mdm Lai recalled. “Yet with every 500 pieces of flyers distributed, I received only one or two enquiries.” Disappointed at the response, Mr Choong learned to design a website for her business. It worked. Soon, she was getting a constant flow of customers. TRUST AND SENSITIVITY The couple’s two children grew up accustomed to people coming and going all the time, and they liked it, Mdm Lai said. “I have very nice customers; they play with my children or buy stuff for them.” As they grew older, though, “the small space was difficult, they were complaining. So I suggested to my husband to move to a bigger house, where I could continue my salon business and my children would be more comfortable”. These days, the mother of two charges about S$9 for a haircut and S$60 for a highlight job, which she said is cheaper than a commercial salon’s rates. She makes about S$3,000 a month. What she did not plan for, was for the Malay-Muslim community to be such a big part of her business. “I did not expect this to happen. As we are Chinese, to have Malay-Muslims even visit your house is rather difficult. They have to trust you totally, and your house cannot have pet dogs and, for some, men as well,” she said. WATCH: Winnie and friends (4:46)   Some of her clients live as far away as Sembawang and Yishun, while others are as close as, well, next door. Her Malay neighbours and their children pop by for hair cuts. A few customers previously would travel across the Causeway to patronise female-only salons run by Muslims. “But the traffic conditions can be quite bad,” she noted. Serving Muslim customers requires some sensitivity to their religion. “I was from Malaysia, so I can understand their ways, their thinking and their requirements.” For example, she said, no touching a customer’s tudung even after she has removed it. A few have even asked if she uses halal-certified hair products (she doesn’t, as they are not so easily found, she says). With more conservative clients, she makes it a point to serve them exclusively, without other customers present. “They are comfortable within my home environment,” the Singaporean said. “They are willing to pay so long as you give them the best service and they trust you.” PLAYING AUNT AGONY  Sometimes, clients bring their children along, and Mdm Lai’s kids keep them company. And some – like Mdm Sarlin – have become firm friends. “Here you can eat, you can laugh, you can tell stories everything. All in one,” said the customer service executive, who chanced upon Mdm Lai’s home salon online two years ago. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She now comes every two or three months to do her hair, and sometimes get the Aunt Agony treatment. “One time I came here, and she could read me. She asked me if I was having problems. I confessed to her and she gave me some advice,” said Mdm Sarlin. “Right after that we became good friends.” For Mdm Lai, the nature of her home business means trade-offs – such as not having a pet dog and having to give up her weekends, typically her busiest time. During festive periods such as Christmas and Chinese New Year, the house, she said, “doesn’t resemble my home”. But the greatest satisfaction of running a home salon is the flexibility to be able to contribute financially to the household, and still spend time with her kids. “My children can see my hardship, they understand how hard you’re working. If you were working outside, they don’t see it,” she said. “But my children understand my tiredness. At times when my husband nags at me, they stand up for me. It is touching, hearing this.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/trust-chinese-home-salon-muslim-women-hari-raya-10439780"}, {"datetime": "16 Jun 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "SPF", "ICA", "MINDEF"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "They invited me to Pyongyang to thank me for translating, says Korean-Singaporean NSman  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The North Korean delegation which was in Singapore earlier this week for the historic meeting between United States president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was suspicious at first of 25-year-old Gim Joo Hyung when they first heard him speak Korean.   Insp (NS) Gim, who was born in South Korea but moved to Singapore as a child, served National Service with the Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) Police Coast Guard and was called back as part of his reservist duties to help with translation work during the Trump-Kim summit. His job was to be the main translator for the SPF and to provide understanding of security measures for both the Singapore and North Korean sides. He also provided translation as and when either side needed it. APPREHENSIVE AT FIRST When the SPF first broached the idea of doing translation work, Gim's immediate reaction was doubt and worry because he had no prior translation experience.  He eventually accepted the job after encouragement from his South Korean parents who told him that \"for their child to contribute even a little bit in this summit is a huge thing for them\".   His work included classified-level translation work to more mundane duties such as helping the visiting delegation with directions or communicating discomforts during their hotel stay. “You can imagine that security would be the most important thing when foreign delegates come, right? So that would require a clear passage of communication between the Singaporean police and the North Korean security team. The biggest challenge is the language barrier,” he said. “I was thinking about the challenges I might face because growing up in Singapore, I’m not that great in Korean and the North Koreans speak with a different accent. They speak a bit faster. They have a different range of vocabulary,” he added. Gim said that the vocabulary they used is more military-like. For example, a friend would be a “bro” to a South Korean, but a “comrade” to a North Korean. “I didn’t know how to address them before the summit. I didn’t know their ranking system before that. So that was more of an impromptu thing, and I [learnt] all the hierarchy on the job,” he said. There was also the issue that he was in police uniform, has a Korean name and could speak Korean. “The most sensitive issue would be that me, as a South Korean, I’m talking to a North Korean. If they know that I’m a South Korean, they might actually not be favourable of talking to me. They may not be responsive to what I’m saying,” he said. However, when Gim met the North Koreans, he said that they were “very, very, surprised” that he could speak Korean. He interacted with both senior and junior security guards from the planning phase to the execution phase.   “The higher-ups, they said ‘Hey you can speak Korean really well. I said, ‘Yes I can. I have Korean blood in me’. I didn’t say I’m [South] Korean per se and they were cool about it,” he said. “The normal guys in the security team … Let’s say, someone asks them a question, they will just rather not speak because they aren’t in a position where they can make decisions. But they came to me asking little, little stuff,” he added, and that was when Gim knew he had their trust. STERN, AVOIDED EYE CONTACT NSman 3WO (NS) Terrence Lee had a similar experience when he was tasked to make sure that the summit’s meeting venue Capella Hotel was free of any Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive (CBRE) threats. While Lee has performed similar preventative sweeps in the past, he said that this round’s sweep was challenging because it involved two foreign counterparts. The sweep, which started two days before the meeting, was done in the presence of representatives from the US and North Korea. With the US, Lee said that it was easier because both teams spoke English. Members from both teams were friendly with each other and even shared techniques for explosive ordnance disposal as they conducted the checks. As for the North Koreans, Lee said they struggled to communicate because there wasn’t a common language. They resorted to using hand signals to communicate because Lee’s team was not allocated a translator. For example, both the US and DPRK had requested to sweep certain rooms themselves without Lee’s team. For some areas used by Chairman Kim, his guards signalled with hand signs to indicate that they will do the sweep themselves, said Lee. “We couldn’t engage. I think they can’t converse in English so we didn’t have any conversation with them,” Lee said. There were also not many opportunities to make friends because of rotating shifts between both teams. “They were doing their own rotations within themselves, basically we do not have time to actually chat with each other,” he said. Even if they had time to chat, like when waiting to pass through Singapore’s immigration as a whole delegation, they would most likely not do so. When Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer Insp Reshma Nair and her colleagues had hundreds of passports from both sides to process, she found that the North Koreans to be less chatty than the Americans. “It was really amazing to see because they’re all very professional and they avoid eye contact with you until the Chairman has passed,” she said. INVITED THOSE WHO HELPED TO PYONGYANG FOR COLD NOODLES Gim said that the relationship between him and the North Korean officers slowly thawed and became less formal as they saw each other more.   \"In the morning, they will greet me. ... When I talk to them first, they will be like, 'Have you had lunch?',\" Gim said.  Despite the short time spent interacting during the summit, their familiarity grew to a point where the North Koreans extended an invitation to Gim and the rest of the SPF to visit Pyongyang. \"When they were leaving, they said, 'Next time, let’s meet in Pyongyang and let’s have Pyongyang naengmyeon (cold noodles)'. I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, I said let’s do that next time,” Gim said. The experience challenged his opinion of North Koreans, which was shaped by media depictions that they are rough, military-trained and inflexible people. “I know that they appreciated my efforts and the SPF when they were leaving, they offered to eat Pyongyang noodles together in their home country. When they thanked everyone in the SPF, everybody said this, 'I hope to meet you soon in Pyongyang'. I mean, that just shows how much they are appreciative and grateful they are. That really showed me that these people are nice,\" said Gim. This, Gim said, was the most memorable moment for him throughout his seven-day reservist recall.  \"I helped the place I was born, the place I grew up, and I helped my mother country Korea,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/they-invited-me-to-pyongyang-to-thank-me-for-translating-says-10438504"}, {"datetime": "16 Jun 2018 09:09AM", "tags": ["dog", "animal welfare", "puppy mills", "stray dogs"], "author": "Siew Tuck Wah", "title": "Commentary: If everyone detests puppy mills, why do they still exist? ", "content": " SINGAPORE: It is difficult to resist cute puppies behind window displays in a pet store, their longing eyes begging us to bring them home. Yet few know that almost every puppy for sale in Singapore comes from a puppy mill, whether local or overseas. They are products of a multi-million dollar industry that has been exploiting animals for commercial gain for many decades. HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC EYE Puppy mills are commercial establishments which breed puppies for sale, often intensively, on a large scale, and in appalling, cramped conditions. Breeding animals suffer a worse fate than their sold-off offspring as mass breeding machines, where they are engineered to push out litter after litter of puppies, with little attention paid to their health, food and care. In Singapore, most puppy farms are located in farmway areas such as Pasir Ris. Among them, 32 are registered with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA). Puppy mills used to be largely unknown to the public in Singapore. However, a rescue of 85 dogs from a commercial puppy mill in Pasir Ris in April 2010 exposed the horrors which went on behind closed doors. The dogs were kept in filthy, small cages with little room to move around. Many suffered from severe skin problems, tick fever and pyometra (infection of the womb) and required urgent, extensive and expensive medical care. Some passed away despite rescuers’ best efforts. RISING AWARENESS AND TIGHTER CONTROLS  There has been greater awareness about the cruelty behind puppy mills since 2010. AVA has also made significant improvements in the licensing and regulation of puppy mills in Singapore, including putting in place higher standards for those who sell animals as pets through a code of conduct for the pet industry. Pet businesses are expected to comply with higher minimum standards of care and encouraged to adopt stipulated best practices on animal housing, management and care. Failure to meet minimal standards can be used to support prosecution or other enforcement actions to ensure animal welfare. Since then, more frequent inspections seemed to have been carried out , with errant breeders taken to task and receiving heavier penalties. In June last year, a breeder of a Pasir Ris pet farm was fined S$180,000 after a surprise inspection by AVA officers found dogs under his care suffering from poor health. One pomeranian was found completely blind, a husky had open wounds and five dogs were found with eye problems, including ulcers and swelling. It was a clear sign that AVA was serious about improving the conditions in puppy mills. Crackdowns like these may serve as cautionary tales to puppy mills, but enforcement will remain a challenge if AVA manpower continues to be limited. The situation has improved compared to a decade ago, but conditions still vary greatly from puppy mill to puppy mill. Stories of dogs found in dire conditions are also still commonplace. Just last year, SOSD Singapore rescued eight dogs with severe untreated medical conditions. They had been sick for years and were not given adequate medical care. Clearly, animal abuse and neglect still goes on in puppy mills, behind closed doors. INCREASED ILLNESSES AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS  Studies have shown that there are increased incidences of distressing behavioural and emotional problems in dogs from puppy mills compared to dogs from more humane sources. They are also more aggressive towards their owners, people around them, and other dogs. Dogs used for breeding in puppy mills are not spared either. A 2011 study by the University of Pennsylvania, highlighted that breeding dogs not only had worse health problems, but also exhibited more persistent and extreme behaviour problems including aggressive reactions stemming from various phobia and, learning deficits. EDUCATION IS KEY  Almost everyone is repulsed by the idea that so many dogs are born into savage conditions. Why then do puppy mills still thrive? The truth is such heart-breaking conditions will persist despite best efforts from legislators, enforcement officers and animal welfare groups. The industry is driven by demand. As long as people purchase these puppies, puppy mills will always be in operation, whether locally or overseas. Many pet stores that import puppies from other countries such as Australia obtain their supply of puppies from puppy mills. The nature of a puppy mill, which is profit-driven, also suggests that owners are incentivised to spend less on space, food and care for these animals, especially those used for breeding. Most will never be able to fully provide the physical and mental stimulation and conditions needed for a dog to be healthy without charging an exorbitant price. So the key to solving the problem lies not only in legislation, but also in public education. Education about alternatives to buying puppy mill dogs have to be more robust. More government-led and public-driven campaigns need to be conducted to further increase public awareness of conditions in the puppy mill industry. Singapore is maturing into a compassionate society. Once the true nature of puppy mills is laid bare for the public to see, I strongly believe that Singaporeans will not choose to turn a blind eye but will seek out more humane alternatives, where the desire to bring home a dog stems from an inherent love for animals. Adopting a dog from a shelter not only saves the life of the animal but also helps to address the stray dog situation in Singapore. People who prefer to buy a dog should do their due diligence to make sure they buy from responsible breeders rather than puppy mills and familiarise themselves with the reputation, track record and breeding practices of the breeder their dog comes from. Doing so will not only ensure the health and quality of the puppy, but safeguards against pet owners contributing to the expansion of a trade that mistreats animals. MORE HELP NEEDED TO OVERCOME HUDDLES TO ADOPTION Singapore is on the right track in terms of animal welfare. The situation here is improving compared to a decade ago and is better than in some neighbouring countries, where animal welfare laws are lacking. Today, many breeding dogs are rescued and put up for adoption by animal welfare groups such as Voices for Animals. They now have a much better fate than their predecessors, most of which were killed once they outlived their reproductive life. However, Singaporeans still face significant roadblocks to adoption. Archaic HDB rules state that we can only keep one small breed dog per HDB flat. Most of the 1,500 dogs in animal shelters for adoption, on the other hand, are medium-to large-sized dogs which, according to the law, cannot be kept in HDB flats. Unless these rules change to give Singaporeans more leeway in adopting dogs, it is always more convenient for prospective pet owners to pop into the nearest pet store, and purchase the next cute puppy they see.  Dr Siew Tuck Wah is President of SOSD, a Singapore-based organisation dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming stray and abandoned dogs.​​​​​​​", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/everyone-finds-puppy-mills-repulsive-why-do-they-still-exist-10314926"}, {"datetime": "16 Jun 2018 07:43AM", "tags": ["scams", "kidnap", "Chinese", "students", "police", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Police issue advisory over kidnap scams involving foreign students", "content": " SINGAPORE: The police issued an advisory on Saturday (Jun 16) over a recent spate of kidnap scams, after receiving at least three such reports over two days from the parents and guardians of Chinese national students in Singapore. The police said that in such kidnap scams, the students were conned into giving money and providing details of their families in China to people claiming to be government officials, who would then use the information provided to contact the victim's parents and claim that their child had been kidnapped. The modus operandi of such scams, the police said, would see the victims receive unsolicited calls from strangers claiming to be government officials. These calls usually employ caller-ID spoofing technology and may look like they are from official government hotline numbers such as “110” or “999”. During the call, the victims would be informed that they had committed criminal offences and were required to assist in investigations to prove that the money they owned was legitimate. They were asked to do any of the following: Withdraw their money and pass it to strangers or transfer the money via cryptocurrency cash deposit machine or to another bank account; update their whereabouts to the scammers over the next few days, change their SIM cards and log out from social media; and provide details on their families in China. Subsequently, the scammers would contact the victim's overseas-based parents and inform that their child had been kidnapped and demand ransom. In one of the reported cases, the police said, a female Chinese national studying in Singapore was cheated of nearly S$27,000 by scammers. She received a call on Jun 11 from someone claiming to be a Chinese government official. The scammer told her that she was involved in a child smuggling case and that her assistance was required in their criminal investigation. Acting on the scammer’s instructions, the victim withdrew S$22,010 from her bank account and handed it over to an unknown man. She also withdrew another S$4,800 to purchase cryptocurrencies for the scammers. Subsequently, the victim was instructed to provide her personal information, including details of her family in China, to them. She was also instructed not to contact anyone in the days that followed. The scammers then contacted her parents to claim that their daughter had been kidnapped by them in Singapore. \"Even though there was no monetary loss suffered by the victim’s parents, the scammers have managed to instil fear and helplessness into them,\" the police said. \"Police take a serious view against any person who may be involved in scams, whether knowingly or unwittingly. Anyone found to be involved in such scams will be subjected to police investigations,\" they added. The police have also advised members to be careful when they receive unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties, and to call the police hotline at 1800-255 0000, or dial 999 for urgent police assistance. \"No government agency will instruct payment through a telephone call or other social messaging platforms (WeChat or Facebook); or ask you for personal banking information such as your internet banking passwords,\" the police said. They added that foreigners who receive calls from people claiming to be from the police in their home country should call the embassy or high commission to verify the legitimacy of the call.

But the 28-year-old, whose family owns a small construction company, is Catholic, not Muslim. This is the second year that Mr Tai has fasted alongside his Muslim employees during Ramadan, and his reason for doing so is simple. “This is the least I can do to relate to them,” said Mr Tai, who joined the family business in 2015 as a project manager, overseeing reconstruction of residential buildings such as bungalows and terrace houses. Other than Muslim workers from Bangladesh, he also enjoys working alongside men from India, Myanmar and Thailand. “Getting to know people from different cultures”, he notes, indulges his “inquisitive character”. “I always consider it a blessing,” he said. FROM BANKING, TO CONTRACTOR WORK Growing up, the Nanyang Technological University graduate in business and finance took scant interest in his parents’ trade. The Tais started out as subcontractors in 1996 installing automated gates for clients. As the firm grew to become a main contractor, the young Mr Tai and his two siblings would sometimes pop by the construction sites, although their conversations with the workers never went beyond “hi” and “bye”. That changed after Mr Tai did a six-month internship at an investment firm in the Middle East, and he started having second thoughts about a career in finance. The sedentary job didn’t quite suit his active nature.  “I decided that I didn’t want to sit down in the office for too long,” he said. So instead of becoming a banker, after getting his bachelor’s degree in 2015, Mr Tai became a contractor - a job he knew nothing about.  In order to pick up as much trade knowledge as quickly as he could, he thought the best way was to live among - and learn from - his workers. The 25 employees from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Thailand, most of whom have worked with the Tais for many years, reside in houses the company rents for them.  Compared to living in workers’ dormitories, as most migrant labourers in Singapore do, the men get more privacy and enjoy the convenience of living near MRT stations. THE WORKERS’ HOUSEMATE For a year, Mr Tai was their housemate. In addition to learning about cuisines “from around the world”, he became more than their young ‘towkay’ or boss. The men, he said, “started out a bit shy”. So to help break down the walls, Mr Tai tried, among other things, to learn simple phrases in their native languages. “‘Have you eaten?’, ‘How are you?’ that kind of thing,” he said. He would also hang out with them after work, bonding over beers, soccer matches and frequent barbecue sessions at East Coast Park. “I just want to make them feel as comfortable as they can. And if they’re happy working for us, I will also be happy,” he said. Mr Tai said that while he got his business acumen from his parents, most of the technical skills he learnt from the “people on the ground”. In particular Gopal, one of their longest-serving site managers from India who has been with them for nine years. The two - who are only three years apart in age - have become fast friends. Said the young boss: Whenever I have fights at home, I come and find my manager and we talk and we drink. And when he has stuff he wants to share with me, he does the same. Mr Tai enjoys such a close relationship with his employees that since 2015, he has attended three of his workers’ weddings back in their hometowns.  And just last year, he even organised a short holiday to Thailand for the more senior staff to allow them to “see the world a bit more”. THE MILLENNIAL APPROACH  However, when there is work to be done, Mr Tai said he does not let “personal feelings” get in the way of his “duty to deliver” to clients. Still, that does not mean sticking to the old-time, top-down style of management. As a millennial, Mr Tai prefers a more open-minded and flexible approach. For example, instead of mandating a fixed number of working hours, he prefers to set his employees benchmarks. “Let’s say we estimate that construction takes 5.5 days. But if we are able to complete the job in 5 days, then what's the point of coming in for the sake of coming in?” he said. I want people to maximise their time at work, and also have some time to relax. He also thinks it is important to be humble. And by “working from the bottom up” and learning from his workers, Mr Tai hopes that eventually, he will be able to “lead and inspire them in a different way”. “I can’t come in and act authoritarian because I lack knowledge and experience,” he said.  He admits that his new, less hierarchical way of managing has yet to “show results” in a concrete manner, but the work culture is definitely changing, he noted. “In the past three years, the mindset of how we approach things has become a lot more positive.” And this, he believes, will lead employees to “reciprocate with work that helps the company”. AN EXPERIENCE IN EMPATHY Last year, Mr Tai decided to fast during Ramadan for the first time. “In our line of work, you’re in a very strenuous environment, and they still try their best to fast for the month,” he said. I wanted to know how it felt like. He got Mr Shaoket Hossen, a employee of 10 years, to serve as his guide. Said the Bangladeshi: “I tell him besides fasting, one month no drinking, no smoking, cannot do bad things - the mind must be clear.” It was due to his experience last year, that Mr Tai did things differently at work this year. “I tried to arrange for the Bangladeshi workers to do jobs that didn't take too much from them, so that they could properly carry out their fast and religious duties.” Just as he spends more time with his Muslim workers during Ramadan, so “on other occasions, such as Deepavali, I spend more time with the Indians,” Mr Tai said. “They really appreciate it when locals show interest and want to be involved with them.” Getting to know his multinational employees better has been “a blessing”. “I get to experience things most Singaporeans won’t get to. Like you can go to India, but do you actually get to go to the village, meet the family, get to know why these workers are here, who they are supporting? “It’s very rewarding knowing that I’m indirectly helping the people they are helping. Like what Shaokot said - we help each other,” said Mr Tai.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/millennial-catholic-towkay-construction-firm-fasting-muslim-10434274"}, {"datetime": "16 Jun 2018 06:03AM", "tags": ["education", "school", "children"], "author": "June Yong", "title": "Commentary: Make full use of the last holiday week to prepare your child for the new school term", "content": " SINGAPORE: As we count down to the start of a new academic term, there is a sense of heaviness in the air.  Kids are not looking forward to the daily grind of early mornings and homework. Adults feel it too, dreading the pre-dawn wakings and endless ferrying from school to tuition and enrichment centres. For this last week of the holidays, most parents will be busy making logistical arrangements and purchases, from getting new uniforms or shoes to replace old ones, to ensuring the new textbooks are dug out and wrapped.   But it may be wise to use this time to meet some of your children’s less apparent, but no less essential needs. It may actually help them to feel more prepared for the new term, and be less anxious over school and homework. READ: What getting ready for school really means REMINISCE, TO NURTURE A STRONG SENSE OF SELF Before the kids start to whine about why the holidays have to end, make a list of the fun things you did together.  Many of us rush from project to project, and task to task, but it is good practice to slow down and let our minds return to the places of fond memories. This simple act of reminiscing not only creates positive feelings triggered by happy memories, it also nurtures a strong sense of self in our young, and equips them with socio-emotional skills. According to Carol Westby, an expert on the role of play and stories in child development:  Children’s sense of self and early narratives emerge as they engage with their caregivers in reminiscing about shared experiences. She asserts that reminiscing and the development of life stories help children develop a strong identity as well as emotional regulation and problem solving skills. It only takes a few minutes to reminisce; pick a relaxed time for the whole family and use photos to jolt the memory and kickstart the conversation. Talk about the various people you met, what they did for you or vice versa, and the lessons learnt along the way. You can also walk down memory lane yourself and share your own growing-up stories. Personal stories are a powerful way of passing down values and a sense of identity to the next generation, so if you’ve kept your old year books, albums, or medals, it’s time to dig them out! If you have a favourite food from yesteryear, why not take the whole family on a spin and re-discover those food items from the past. If time permits, embark on a family craft project together, such as a holiday scrapbook, using printed photos taken from your favourite overseas trips or local excursions. We did one for our Melbourne holiday last year, and until this day, my children will pick it up from the bookshelf and talk about the fond memories. STRENGTHEN FAMILY BONDS If you’ve never given much thought to creating family rituals, this is a good time to start. Parenting author Rebecca Eanes describes: \"Traditions give us a shared identity. They strengthen our bond as a family unit. They create structure, stability, a sense of familiarity and safety, all things that are important for children, particularly young children. Traditions help us to nourish one another.\" Family traditions are simple to do, but harder to upkeep as children grow older and have differing schedules. At the heart of it is a shared activity and space that draws everyone together from their individual preoccupations, and builds connections. It could be an in-house movie and popcorn night this weekend or an inter-generational board games night where you rope in the young-at-heart grandparents. It could also involve an outdoor adventure such as a family camp-out at East Coast or Pasir Ris park. You can even jazz up a very common family ritual: Telling bedtime stories. Instead of your child choosing a book and you reading it out loud, get everyone to act out a favourite story. Classics such as The Three Little Pigs and We’re Going On A Bear Hunt lend themselves well to dramatisation. Or take a familiar story and create your family’s own unique ending. It’s a great way to get their creative juices flowing and help them learn that there is no one “correct” way to write a story.   SET LEARNING AND BEHAVIOURAL GOALS Having a plan to tackle the academic work ahead can work wonders for a child who's been struggling to complete her work on time. My middle schooler has been feeling swamped with work since the year began. She also experiences some mental roadblocks when she encounters a Math question that is very different from what she's used to. During the recent parent-teacher conference, I asked her teacher for advice and she suggested letting her work on the usual problem sums, with an added twist. For example, I could throw in an additional variable or change the way the question is framed.  The aim of this exercise isn't so much to throw her into the deep end; it's to help expand her repertoire of knowledge, and increase her confidence in tackling a wide range of sums. For her, as we wind down the summer holidays, I hope to spend time tackling some math sums together while keeping it fun and light-hearted. She is a visual learner and loves to doodle, so who knows, I may even get her to draw cartoons on the math models to make them more animated and less of a drudgery. As we enter the new term, we may set some fresh academic goals, such as, \"We will work on three new math sums every week.\" I am also trying to build her journal writing skills. One related goal would be: \"I will write two journal entries every week to mum, and mum will reply those entries with thoughts of her own.\" LEARNING NOT PERFORMING Let’s not forget behavioural goals. For her, one area to work on is becoming more aware and in control of her stressed emotions when it comes to school work. Practising some coping strategies, such as pouring an ice-cold drink or standing by a snack on her desk, may help to keep her emotions in check and be more focused on her work. Remember to set more learning goals than performance goals. The latter focuses heavily on results and grades, while the former emphasises learning, processes and work habits.  When it comes to making mistakes, the consequence is less dire for the learning-oriented goal than the performance goal. Such a process-oriented approach can help our children be less apprehensive about making mistakes, as they come to view them as part and parcel of learning. Holidays are meant for rest, and for the restoration of weary bodies and minds. Whether it is reminiscing the good ol’ times, or creating a wacky tradition together, I hope you will make full use of this last leg of the June holidays.

'Singapore', the tiny Southeast Asian city-state that played host to nuclear talks earlier this week, was the most searched term on internet search engine Google in the United States on Monday (Jun 11) with over 2 million hits. Related searches during those 24 hours included 'Where is Singapore', 'Singapore summit' and 'time in Singapore'. Blanket media coverage on Monday included Kim's surprise tour of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and its surrounding gardens, and the first hours of the meeting with Trump in the resort island of Sentosa. Singapore said it spent US$20 million (US$15 million) on the summit, a figure that drew the ire of some citizens. However, marketing experts say the coverage generated from the event could be worth more than 10 times that. \"It places Singapore on the map for international audiences,\" said Oliver Chong, executive director, communications and marketing capability at Singapore Tourism Board. Tourism contributes around 4 per cent to Singapore's GDP per annum. Visitor arrivals hit a record 17.4 million last year boosted by China, its top market, and India. But just months ago, lifestyle magazine Time Out ranked Singapore among the world's least exciting cities. Andrew Darling, CEO and founder of communications agency West Pier Ventures, said it would cost more than US$200 million to generate the kind of publicity Singapore has received so far by hosting the summit. Media intelligence firm Meltwater said the coverage over the three days around the summit equated to US$270 million of advertising, while the month leading up to it was worth US$767 million. \"The Trump-Kim Summit has arguably been the single most important event that brought Singapore to the attention of the most people around the world,\" said Jason Tan of media advertising agency Zenith Singapore. \"For many Asians, Singapore as the choice of destination reinforces our image as an efficient and safe country. For Americans who might not be as familiar with Asia, the summit definitely brought Singapore into the global spotlight.\" Online travel agent Expedia said its data showed searches from global customers for trips to Singapore had risen by 58 per cent on Jun 10 and Jun 11 relative to the same days in 2017, including a 220 per cent rise in searches by US-based customers. Still, even some who should know better struggled to accurately place Singapore - known as the Little Red Dot in reference to its depiction on a map. The US State Department mistakenly made Singapore a part of neighbouring Malaysia in a note issued in connection with the summit, drawing a slew of snide comments on social media.

Abe, his public support hit by scandals, has adopted as his top domestic priority the issue of Japanese abducted to be trained as spies, vowing to withhold economic assistance until it is resolved, along with denuclearisation. In 2002, North Korea admitted that it kidnapped 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, and five returned home. Abe has said he will not rest until the return of the rest, an issue he pressed U.S. President Donald Trump to raise at this week's summit with Kim. Japan believes 17 of its citizens were abducted, five of whom were repatriated. Eight are said by North Korea to have died, while four never entered the country. Japanese media said one possibility was for Abe to visit Pyongyang, perhaps as early as August. Speculation about a Kim-Abe summit emerges periodically, especially when Abe's support weakens, but a ruling party lawmaker said in March any such meeting would have to follow a North-South Korea summit and a U.S.-North Korea summit. Government sources, including one directly involved with the matter, told Reuters that Japanese officials plan to discuss a summit with North Korean officials at a conference on Northeast Asian security set for Thursday and Friday in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Another possibility could be for Abe to meet Kim on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum to be held in September in Vladivostok, a source with knowledge of the matter said, although timing could be difficult, with Abe facing a ruling party leadership election the same month. In Seoul, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told a news conference that Abe was willing to resolve the issue through \"various channels and routes\" with North Korea. \"If the leaders meet we need to have a summit meeting which would lead to resolution of the issue and we will make coordination going forward.\" TOO SOON FOR SUMMIT? On Thursday, Abe met the families of the missing Japanese, renewing his pledge to bring home their loved ones. \"Using the U.S.-North Korea leaders' meeting as an opportunity, we will face up to North Korea and solve this,\" he told the group, many of them elderly and frail. Shigeo Iizuka, whose sister Yaeko Taguchi was kidnapped in 1978, leaving behind two infants in a creche, said he was glad the issue had been raised with Kim but pointed to North Korea's history of breaking its promises. \"The problem is there's a long history of things just being dragged out, and of deception,\" Iizuka told a news conference, referring to instances when North Korea reneged on promises to provide information on the missing Japanese, most recently in 2014. \"We need to make sure there's nothing like that and things are done right this time ... nothing hasty.\" (Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in SEOUL; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/japan-eyes-kim-abe-summit-but-abductees--families-urge-caution-10430296"}, {"datetime": "14 Jun 2018 05:31PM", "tags": ["North Korea", "Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "Ri Chun Hee"], "author": "", "title": "Gushing North Korean broadcaster Ri Chun Hee hails Trump-Kim summit", "content": " SEOUL: North Korean television presenter Ri Chun Hee has for years announced the biggest news in her own effusive style, and this week she returned to the airwaves to herald Kim Jong Un's historic meeting with US President Donald Trump.  \"The historic meeting pioneered a new history,\" Ri said on Wednesday (Jun 13), wearing her traditional pink Korean dress and flashing a wide smile. \"The great leader of our party, the nation, and military, Kim Jong Un, adopted a joint statement with the president of the United States.\" Kim's summit with Trump in Singapore on Tuesday was the first meeting between sitting leaders of the two countries. In recent years, Ri has taken a high-profile role in publicising North Korea's tests of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles. Late last year, for example, she announced North Korea's test of what it said was a hydrogen bomb, telling viewers it was a \"perfect success\". With the test of an intercontinental ballistic missile with the range to strike anywhere in the United States, \"the state nuclear force\" was complete, she gushed. This year, however, Ri's broadcasts have charted the easing of tension. She reported in April on the first summit between North and South Korea in a decade, and then on Trump's meeting with Kim. \"The supreme leader cherishes her voice and North Koreans notice it as well, so there is no reason for Kim Jong Un to replace someone who has been called a treasure in North Korea,\" said Ahn Chan-il, a North Korean defector who now lives in South Korea. \"Even if the North Korean regime opens their country for revolution, this announcer will declare that decision.\" Ri famously wept on air when announcing the death of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung in 1994.

In a joint declaration following their meeting in Singapore on Tuesday, the North Korean leader pledged to move toward complete denuclearization of the peninsula and Trump vowed to guarantee the security of the United States' old foe. Forty percent of those polled said they did not believe the countries would stick to their commitments. Another 26 percent said they believed the United States and North Korea would meet their commitments, while 34 percent said they did not know whether they would follow through. Thirty-nine percent believe the summit has lowered the threat of nuclear war between the United States and nuclear-armed North Korea, slightly more than the 37 percent who said they did not believe it changed anything. Trump has pursued what he calls a \"maximum pressure\" campaign\" against Pyongyang to force it to give up its nuclear weapons. He toughened up international sanctions to further isolate North Korea and then agreed to meet directly with Kim after South Korea's president convinced him that the North was committed to giving up its nuclear weapons. The Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests the Republican president has broad support for one of his biggest foreign policy efforts, despite criticism from non-proliferation experts that Trump had exacted few concrete commitments from Kim on Tuesday on dismantling his nuclear arsenal. Republicans appear much more enthusiastic than Democrats about the potential benefits of the summit. The poll found that Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that the meeting lowered the threat of nuclear war, and they were three times as likely to say that both sides would follow through on their commitments. Democrats typically give Trump low approval ratings - only 12 percent approve of his overall job performance. But about 30 percent said they approved of his handling of North Korea. Trump, who returned to Washington early on Wednesday, hailed the meeting with Kim, the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, as a success that had removed the North Korean nuclear threat. Their seemingly friendly meeting was in sharp contrast to their tit-for-tat insults and bellicose rhetoric late last year while Pyongyang carried out its biggest nuclear and missile tests. In the poll, Trump received a 51 percent approval rating for his handling of North Korea and also led the list of leaders who should take the most credit for the summit and the joint pledge. Forty percent say the former real estate developer should take the most credit, followed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in with 11 percent. Kim was third with 7 percent. MIGHT IMPACT VOTERS Trump has repeatedly touted his role in bringing the reclusive North Korea to the negotiating table, a feat that he says his predecessors were unable to pull off. It may be too soon though to know whether Trump's diplomatic breakthrough will help Republican candidates in congressional elections in November, when Democrats will attempt to retake control of both houses. Typically foreign policy is not a major concern for mid-term voters. “It’s too early to say if there is a net positive out of that,” said Republican strategist Alice Stewart. “It’s a good step to have the conversation but that doesn’t yet mean that it’s a success.\" Ron Bonjean, also a Republican strategist, said voters were more likely to be influenced if there was serious and measurable progress closer to the election. The Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll was conducted online in English, between June 12-13 in the United States. It gathered responses from more than 1,000 adults, including more than 400 Democrats and 400 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll’s precision, of 4 percentage points for the full sample and 6 percentage points for the Democrats and Republicans, meaning that the results could vary in either direction by that amount.

The brightly coloured, wooden-hulled boats called jongs sailed in an exhibition event organised by the Singapore Sailing Federation (SSF), as part of efforts to revive the centuries-old Malay tradition of jong racing. “We want to recognise that this is very much part of Singapore’s history and tradition,” said SSF chief executive Lim Han Ee.  Up to half a century ago, jong racing was popular with children, while their larger manned versions called kolek were sailed by older men around the coastal areas like Katong, Siglap and Pasir Panjang. Mr Fawzi Nasir, who co-organised the demonstration event, used to sail his family’s kolek around St John’s island where he grew up in the 1960s.   “It’s a dying sport. Since the 1970s we haven’t had these traditional races in Singapore,” said the 48-year-old. (Read: An island-boy's race against time and tide, Singapore family helps bring back centuries-old tradition in Riau islands, and A yearning to bring kolek races back to Singapore.) Mr Rohaizan Zain, SSF assistant general manager, said: “Our older staff have memories of these jongs - some used to stay on Pulau Tekong or the other islands, and these are the activities that they lived and grew up with.”  Said Mr Lim: “We’re doing this with the view of bringing it back as a race in the Pesta Sukan - it’s a great way to re-engage the community and welcome new people into the sport of sailing.” Mr Rohaizan added: “This is also a way to make our young sailors realise that we have deep roots in sailing - these traditional boats originate from here, it’s part of our maritime culture.” THE SPORT’S COMEBACK  Jongs come in different sizes - from hull lengths of less than a metre, to almost two metres long. The bigger ones could easily be mistaken as a boat meant for man, but jongs are designed to sail on their own, unmanned - meaning every component of the boat has to be carefully adjusted before it is set into the water. “You need to calibrate the sails and outriggers, and it really takes some skill on reading the wind direction,” said Mr Fawzi. Unlike a normal sailing dinghy where a sailor leans out from the boat, the jong uses a weighted beam called an outrigger attached to its side. This enables the sails to catch wind, propelling the boat forward without capsizing.  Jongs can reach speeds of up to 8-10 knots - impressive considering these boats are made by hand, and often by islanders with no formal training in boat making. “It may look very simple but once you get into it you realise that these guys are masters at what they do,” said Mr Lim, an ex-national sailor himself. Mr Lim only came to know about the sport about a month ago when he brought a team of sailors from Singapore to witness a regatta in Desaru, where almost 200 participants showed up with their jongs. “It was helluva fun. People were really into their discipline and activity, and I thought, ‘wow, why don’t we have this in Singapore?’” he said. In other places like the Riau Islands, traditional regattas still take place frequently - and these kampong-versus-kampong competitions attract spectators by the thousands. Mr Lim says the SSF will start a category for jongs in the next Pesta Sukan Regatta in August. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But looking for participants may not be so easy, said Mr Mazlan Nasir, Mr Fawzi’s brother. I called all my old-time kampong friends to come for this demo event but no one was interested, and none of them have jongs anymore. Still, people like Mr Fawzi’s family and Mr Lim have ambitious hopes to revive the sport: “We will start small. All you need is five or six jongs for a race, but if we can get more than 20 participants, that would be a good number. “We will gauge the interest and if people start coming, they want to buy (jongs) and participate, then it’s a way to grow the community,” said Mr Lim.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mr Lim also hopes to attract participants from Indonesia and Malaysia in the future. “It’s one of those things that can easily go into the hundreds. Then it’ll become a regional Southeast Asian event,” said Mr Lim. Boatmaker Mr Ilol, 58, who came to Singapore from the Riau Islands for the jong demo, said: “I’ve been sailing jongs since I was a kid. In the past we only played it in kampongs, but now I feel very proud that it’s becoming an international sport. It’s part of our Malay culture and we should preserve it.” Watch CNA Insider’s earlier video, Racing Time And Tide  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/vanished-singapore-jong-racing-comeback-pesta-sukan-10429536"}, {"datetime": "13 Jun 2018 09:13PM", "tags": ["Grab", "GrabShare"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Passengers, drivers voice concerns after GrabShare disabled between 1am-5am", "content": " SINGAPORE: Ride-hailing firm Grab has disabled its GrabShare feature between 1am and 5am, after receiving \"numerous report(s)\" about safety concerns. GrabShare allows passengers to carpool in a car or taxi with other travellers headed in the same direction for a cheaper ride.  The move to disable the function during that period of time was announced to Grab drivers earlier this month, but passengers said they were not notified of the change. In an email to drivers last Monday (Jun 4), Grab said: \"Dear Partner, to further improve the GrabShare experience and safety for our Partners and passengers, the GrabShare service will not be available from 1am - 4.59am daily.  \"This change has been in effect starting today. All other services will remain available at all hours.\" \"THEY SHOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENT\" Passengers who wrote to Grab's customer service after realising that they were unable to make a booking on GrabShare received an email response saying the service was disabled during those hours \"due to safety concern\".  The email did not elaborate on what those safety concerns were.  \"We seek your kind understanding on this matter as upon receiving numerous report on safety concern both from passenger and driver (sic), we decided to disable the service during the time frame mention (sic) as a safety precaution,\" the email stated. Kamal Razaleigh, an executive who previously used GrabShare to travel home after ending his shift at 2am, was among the passengers who wrote to Grab.  He told Channel NewsAsia that it was \"unacceptable\" that Grab did not inform passengers of this development.  \"It's a little disrespectful. I had to find it out from my driver,\" he said. Mr Kamal typically spends S$13 for his ride home using GrabShare. Now, he forks out up to S$24 for JustGrab or taxi rides.  Another regular Grab user, Ms Nancy Chan, said she found out on Saturday (Jun 9) that the GrabShare service was disabled when she tried to make a booking at 2am.  “I was shocked as there was no proper notification from Grab that they had removed the service until I tried to make the booking. They should be more transparent and make an announcement before they implemented this so that riders can plan better,\" she said. Ms Chan added that besides the lack of transparency, she is also concerned about surges in demand and pricing that typically happens just before 1am. “Prices are bound to surge just before the 1am timing as more people try to book a GrabShare rides right before 1am,” she said. “I took a ComfortDelgro taxi after 1am from town recently. The price is now lower than Grab.\" Grab launched the GrabShare service in December 2016 as more commuters in Singapore were seen to be willing to share rides with strangers, in return for cheaper fares.   The company revealed that GrabShare rides are 30 per cent cheaper than JustGrab rides, but still subject to surge pricing. Furthermore, only two passenger bookings are allowed per trip.  This, coupled with GrabShare’s matching algorithm, minimises long detours for both passengers and drivers, Grab said.  \"LESS VALUE FOR MY FUEL\": GRAB DRIVER  Some Grab drivers Channel NewsAsia spoke to said disabling the GrabShare feature during the stipulated period has adversely affected their income.  One driver who declined to be named said GrabShare allowed him to earn more from each ride as he would be able ferry more passengers while driving in the same general direction.  \"When I work late hours, I like to take advantage of GrabShare at Changi Airport because I can pick up more than one passenger when there's an incoming flight,\" he said.  \"But now I can only take one at a time. It's less value for my fuel,\" he added.  Another driver, who also wanted to remain anonymous, told Channel NewsAsia that he once earned a total of S$50 from two passengers after picking them up separately via GrabShare at around 3am.  \"There is actually quite a lot of business for us at night. Grab has just found another way to reduce our income,\" said the 28-year-old.  \"This is an example of how Grab exerts its monopoly in the ride-sharing market.

HARD MATCH TO SECURE The lead-up to the upcoming match, which kicks off at 8pm, was not easy either with FAS initially struggling to find opponents for a friendly match before securing the match with Myanmar despite tight schedules. “It has been a challenge arranging international games outside of FIFA international windows and we would like to express our appreciation to the Myanmar Football Federation for accepting our invitation to play this friendly next week,\" said FAS' head of national teams management Eric Ong.

In a reminder of the danger of trade disputes,  shares in Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp  fell as much as 41.5 percent, wiping US$3 billion off its market value, as it resumed trade after agreeing to pay up to US$1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government. Its Shenzhen shares  fell by their 10 percent limit, dragging down mainland Chinese shares around 1 percent The Mexican and Canadian currencies, remained under pressure from trade war fears, the former hitting 16-month lows against the U.S. dollar . POLICY Investors see central bank policy mistakes as the second-biggest risk for markets, the BAML poll showed. Projections from the Fed's March meeting suggest a benchmark rate of 2.1 percent at end of 2018. That implies a total of three rate rises this year. But some reckon four increases are possible. \"The focus is on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year and next and how much beyond the levels it considers as neutral to the economy, or what they call the longer-run rates,\" said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy group at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. As the Fed meeting approached, the dollar traded flat against a basket of currencies  giving up some earlier gains but stayed near three-week highs versus the yen . It firmed sharply against some emerging currencies - the Turkish lira fell one percent toward recent record lows The euro eased off last week's three-week high of US$1.1840 but remained underpinned by expectations the ECB will mention plans to wind up its stimulus and even hint at the timing of its first interest rate rise when it meets on Thursday. However, Italian bond yields fell further with two-year yields down 14 bps to below 1 percent after EU affairs minister Paolo Savona, considered a eurosceptic, said the euro was \"indispensable\". Such comments have soothed worries about Italy's euro membership, but analysts say the government's high-spending plans could boost yields again once the relief rally ebbs. \"In the longer term, they need to do something different to bring the deficit under control, not just pay lip service toward the euro,\" Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger said. Britain's pound  and bond yields slipped as data showing subdued inflation checked expectations for an interest rate rise this year.

The implementation of the smoke-free zone in the Orchard Road area will be delayed to the end of this year instead of starting in July, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Wednesday (Jun 13). It was reported last year that NEA planned to transform Orchard Road into a smoke-free zone from Jul 1, except for several designated smoking areas. There will be about 40 of these areas including five publicly-owned ones at Orchard Towers, Far East Plaza, The Heeren, Cuppage Terrace, and behind Somerset MRT station, NEA said. More than 100 buildings will be within the no-smoking zone when it starts. The new implementation date aims to \"provide more time for businesses to prepare for the no smoking zone\", as some businesses gave feedback that they needed more time to make the necessary preparations, said the environment agency in a news release. Businesses will need to prepare by identifying and setting up designated smoking areas, and smokers will need to familiarise themselves with these areas.  Additionally, restaurants within the smoke-free zone that have existing smoking corners will also be given an extension of about six months to remove them. This follows last year's decision to stop accepting applications from food outlets islandwide to set up smoking areas in their premises.  However, smokers can still smoke at existing corners at these outlets outside Orchard Road until the existing licence for these places end. For the first three months after the smoke-free zone is implemented, those caught smoking in Orchard Road will receive verbal warnings and those who ignore the warnings may be issued a fine.  After this three-month period, enforcement action will be taken against offenders who smoke in public areas within the smoke-free zone.

He was repatriated to Singapore in 1998, but once again escaped and stayed in Kuala Lumpur until Mar 2 this year, according to court documents.  According to court documents, Foo had suggested that they rob Lee’s former employer, then one of four partners of an engineering company, because Lee was having financial problems. Foo and Lee involved How in the plan.  Lee had previously told Foo that the victim would withdraw money for his employees' salaries from an OCBC bank branch on Yung Kuang Road in Taman Jurong. Foo and Lee stole a motorcycle the night before the crime from the void deck of Block 3, Bedok South Ave 1 and parked it at a car park in Jurong. The next morning, Foo and How travelled on the motorbike to the bank outlet, armed with knives. Lee drove his own car and stayed in it at a car park nearby, as his former employer would recognise him. At about 11am on Jul 5, the victim left the bank after spending 30 minutes withdrawing S$44,876.23, and walked towards his car, which was parked about 20m away. This was when Foo and How approached the victim, while holding the knives wrapped in newspapers. Out of fear, the victim threw the envelope with the money onto the ground. Some money fell out, which How and Foo picked up. They made away with all the cash on the stolen motorcycle and went to meet Lee at the car park.  They got away in the car, and later met up at Foo’s home in Chai Chee to split the spoils. Foo received more than S$10,000, which he used to pay off debts and for his daily expenses. Besides the four-year jail term, Foo was also disqualified from driving for three years. The Prosecution proceeded on two charges, and one other charge was taken into consideration. In October 1996, Lee was sentenced to three years, two months in jail, six strokes of the cane and disqualified from driving for three years. Two months later, How was sentenced to three years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane.  For armed robbery, Foo could have been jailed between two and 10 years, and given at least 12 strokes of the cane.  For stealing the motorcycle, he could have been jailed for between one and seven years, and fined, and disqualified from driving for at least three years.

If no further progress is made toward peace on the Korean peninsula, all the back-and-forth, the Moon-Kim meetings, the Singapore summit itself, is at worst another good start that faded. It is more likely, however, a turning point. It is easy to announce a morning-after defeat for Trump: To criticise the agreement as vague and lacking in specific commitments regarding denuclearisation. But those critics ignore Kim's moratorium on nuclear and ballistic missile testing, the return of American prisoners, the closing of a ballistic missile test site, and the shutting down of a major nuclear test facility without opening a new one. It is easy to forget that a few months ago North Korea was still testing nuclear devices to spark fears of a dark war. Calling the Singapore summit a failure in light of more detailed agreements and different efforts from the past ignores the reality that all of those past agreements failed. Only a few months ago State Department North Korean expert Joseph Yun's retirement triggered a round of dire claims of a \"void at (the) head of Trump's Korea diplomacy.\" Similar predictions were made over the lack of an American ambassador in Seoul. The State Department was decimated. The Council on Foreign Relations assessed the chances of war on the peninsula at 50 per cent. Success on the Korean peninsula, as in the Cold War, will be measured by the continued sense that war is increasingly unlikely. Success in Singapore is the commitment to meet again, and again after that; the more modest 2015 Iranian Accord (which didn’t even involve actual nuclear weapons) took 20 months to negotiate. Cold War treaties required years of effort, crossing administrations in their breadth. To expect more than a commitment to the next steps (did anyone think Kim would box up his nukes post-summit and mail them off?) is ahistorical. Did none of those complaining ever go on a first date? Singapore also signals it is time to abandon now-disproven tropes. Trump and Kim are not madmen and their at times bellicose rhetoric is just that. Both men will need to balance conciliatory steps forward with rougher gestures directed at domestic hardline audiences. So there will be tweets and setbacks. But the idea this is a North Korean ruse is worn thin. “Small countries confronting big countries seldom bluff,” one history of the Cuban Missile Crisis explained. “They can’t afford to.” The pieces for progress are in place if they can be manipulated well, including a North Korea with a young, Western-educated, multi-lingual leader perhaps envisioning himself as his nation’s Deng Xiaoping, the man who will bring the future to his isolated nation while preserving its sovereignty. “We have... decided to leave the past behind,” Kim said as he and Trump signed their joint statement. There is momentum in Pyongyang, a restless and growing consumerist middle class living in a parallel semi-market economy fuelled by dollars, Chinese currency, and increasing access to foreign media. Couple that with an American president willing to break the established \"rules\" for (not) working with North Korea. A careful look shows the glass is more than half full. NOTABLE EVENTS   Another important difference this time is the presence of South Korean President Moon Jae In. He was a prime mover behind the notion of any summit at all, helping convince Washington North Korea is a uniquely top-down system and needs to be dealt with as such. His April 27 meeting with Kim established the main negotiating points ahead of Singapore. After Trump’s May 24 initial cancellation of the Singapore meeting, Moon shuttled between Washington and Panmunjom to get the process moving again. In a climate of constant bleating about war, that was skilled diplomacy played out on a very big stage. No nuclear negotiations in history have had such an interlocutor. Moon’s continuing juggling of his roles – honest broker, fellow Korean nationalist with shared cultural, linguistic, historical, and emotional ties, American ally, informal adviser to both Kim and Trump – is key to the next steps. Moon himself is the vehicle in place to resolve problems that in the past were deal-breakers. What didn’t happen in Singapore is also important. Trump did not give away “the store.” In fact, there is no store Trump could have given away. The United States agreed to suspend military exercises which have been strategically cancelled in the past, and which can be restarted anytime. The real deterrent is off-peninsula anyway: B-2s flying from Missouri, and missile-armed subs forever hidden under the Pacific. Trump did not empower Kim. Meeting with one’s enemies is not a concession. Diplomacy is not a magic legitimacy powder the United States can choose to sprinkle on a world leader. The summit acknowledges the like-it-or-not reality of seven decades of Kim-family rule over a country armed with nuclear weapons. Trump’s decision to begin the peace process with a summit is worthy. Imagining a summit as some sort of an award the United States can bestow on a country for “good behaviour” is beyond arrogant. Successive administrations’ worth of that thinking yielded a North Korea armed with a hydrogen bomb, missiles that can reach the United States, and a permanent state of war. A top-down approach (China is the go-to historical example) is a valid way forward in that light. WHAT’S NEXT?  The easiest thing to do now is generically dismiss the summit; the North will cheat and Trump will tweet. The harder thing will be to parse carefully what is next. The United States must incentivise denuclearisation. The 2015 Iran Accord is one example, where sanctions were eased, trade cranked up, frozen assets released, all alongside Iranian steps to reduce testing, production, and stocks of fissionable materials. Another reaches back to 1991, when Washington provided financial rewards for the inventory, destruction, and ultimately the disposal of weapons of mass destruction in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. New jobs for the out-of-work nuclear scientists, too, to keep them from selling their skills elsewhere. But more than anything Trump must convince Kim to trust him, particularly in light of Iraq, Libya, and especially Iran, because the core ask here is extraordinary. Only one nation in history that self-developed nuclear weapons, the white minority government in South Africa, ever fully gave them up, and that was only after the apartheid regime was about to disappear into history. If Trump followed advice from the left he would have stayed home like past presidents. If he’d listened to the right he’d have bulled into the room and said “Lose the nukes, number one and we’re done” and the process would have truly failed. North Korea developed nuclear weapons to guarantee its survival. If the United States and South Korea want the North to give up those weapons, something has to replace them as that assurance of survival. The summit created the platform. The key to what happens next is how Trump, Moon and Kim work to resolve that issue.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to grow by 3.2 per cent this year, according to 28 respondents polled in a quarterly survey of professional forecasters conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and released on Wednesday (Jun 13). This is unchanged from the previous survey in March. “Tightening monetary policy across the developed world, in particular by the US Federal Reserve, has led to increasing concerns over rising interest rates,” MAS said in its report. “This risk is cited by 47 per cent of respondents, up from just 17 per cent,” it added. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to announce its decision on the US interest rate on Wednesday (2am Singapore time) after a two-day meeting. A rate hike of another 25 basis points is widely expected, but focus will also be on the Fed's statement wording for clues on the future pace of interest rate hikes. The Fed’s current monetary policy tightening cycle began in December 2015. The Singapore economy grew by 4.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, which was higher than the median forecast of 3.8 per cent reported in the March survey. For the second quarter, the respondents expect Singapore’s economy to grow by 3.9 per cent. GDP growth for next year is projected to ease to 2.8 per cent. The government’s forecast for 2018 GDP is 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. In 2017, GDP growth was 3.6 per cent. In its report, MAS also said that the respondents expect manufacturing, finance and insurance to do relatively well this year, compared with sectors such as construction and wholesale and retail trade. “The global tech cycle’s impact on the electronics sector, and external growth in general, continue to be the two other most commonly cited upside risks,” MAS said. The outlook on the property market also remains positive, MAS said. On downside risks, the report showed, the economists highlighted that the implementation of trade tariffs by the US and subsequent responses from the affected economies. “Global trade protectionism continues to dominate the list of potential downsides,” MAS said, adding that 84 per cent of respondents expect the escalation of trade frictions to present a significant downside risk. Meanwhile, the possibility of a slowdown in China from domestic stresses is comparatively more subdued, with 21 per cent of respondents highlighting it as a key risk, down from 53 per cent previously. The forecast for headline inflation for the full year is expected at 0.8 per cent, down from 1.0 per cent in the March survey.

The latest retrenchment numbers were also at the lowest since the first quarter of 2013, when it was 2,120. MOM said the decline was broad-based across manufacturing, construction and services and that the main reason for retrenchment continues to be business restructuring and reorganisation. The six-month re-entry rate into employment of retrenched residents declined marginally to 61 per cent in the first quarter of the year, from 63 per cent in the previous quarter. The decline was more notable among Professional, Managers, Executives & Technicians (PMETs), those with diploma and post-secondary qualifications, as well as those aged from 30 to 39, the ministry said. Meanwhile, the re-entry rate rose among those aged below 30, aged 50 and over, and for those with secondary and below qualifications. DECLINE IN RESIDENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE The seasonally adjusted resident long-term unemployment rate also edged down in the first quarter to 0.7 per cent in March, from 0.8 per cent in December.  Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate came in at 2 per cent, an improvement from the 2.1 per cent in December last year. For residents, the unemployment rate was 2.8 per cent, down from 3 per cent, and the rate remained unchanged at 3 per cent for Singapore citizens. Meanwhile, total employment, excluding foreign domestic workers, grew slightly. The increase of 400 was a reversal from the first quarter of 2017, when the figure declined 9,400. MOM attributed this to employment growth in the services sectors, which they said more than offsett declines in work permit holders in the construction and marine shipyard sectors. The ministry said it expects overall labour demand to expand this year, albeit unevenly across sectors. Job opportunities will be available in the finance and insurance, infocomms and media, healthcare, professional services, logistics and wholesale trade sectors, it added. Hiring is expected to remain cautious in the construction and marine shipyard sector. To keep unemployment low, the ministry said, it is critical to prepare workers and businesses to be “agile and responsive to economic restructuring and the evolving employment landscape”. “MOM and Workforce Singapore will support workers in upgrading their skillsets for new opportunities through the Adapt and Grow initiative, while helping businesses to innovate and transform through the Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme and the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP),” said MOM. SKILLS AND JOBS MISMATCHES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE: PATRICK TAY Structural challenges such as skills and jobs mismatches will be the main causes of unemployment in Singapore in the near and medium term, said NTUC Assistant Secretary-General Patrick Tay. “For the first half of 2018, I expect retrenchment figures to remain low but we will expect to still see pockets of layoffs due to re-organisation, restructuring and re-strategisation amidst technological/digital disruption and the rise of cloud, machine and crowd,” Mr Tay said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. He also noted that it will become even more challenging to further reduce the unemployment rate in light of the low figure.  As such, Mr Tay said, tripartite partners need to continue to work even closer together to overcome the structural challenges. The labour movement will also work to encourage best practices in hiring and retaining older workers, he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/retrenchments-lowest-in-5-years-resident-unemployment-rate-10426326"}, {"datetime": "13 Jun 2018 10:16AM", "tags": ["Toyota", "Japan", "vehicle brands", "automotive", "Toyota Motor Corp", "SoftBank Group Corp"], "author": "", "title": "Toyota to invest US$1 billion in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab", "content": " SINGAPORE: Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to invest US$1 billion in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab as a lead investor in the company's ongoing financing round, which was launched after it bought the regional business of Uber Technologies Inc . The investment by Toyota is the largest-ever by an automaker in the global ride-hailing sector, the six-year old start-up said in a statement on Wednesday (Jun 13). It is also the latest collaboration between a global vehicle maker and a technology firm as ride-hailing companies dominate the fast-growing field of mobility services, raising the risk of a future where car ownership declines in favour of such services. Japan's SoftBank Group Corp last month announced it would invest US$2.25 billion in the Cruise autonomous vehicle unit of General Motors Co, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC have agreed to supply vehicles for Alphabet Inc's self-driving car subsidiary Waymo. Toyota's investment will allow Grab, which counts peer Didi and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp as investors, to further expand its range of online to offline services, such as food delivery and digital payments, deeper into the region. Grab will be valued at just over US$10 billion after Toyota's investment, said a person familiar with the matter. A Toyota executive will be appointed to Grab's board of directors and a dedicated Toyota team member will be seconded to Grab as an executive officer, the ride-hailing firm said. Wednesday's announcement deepens Toyota's partnership with Grab, following an earlier, undisclosed investment by the automaker's trading arm last year. Toyota has installed its driving recorder devices in some vehicles operated by Grab, using the collected data stored in its mobility services platform to analyse driving patterns and develop vehicle services. The automaker on Wednesday said by deepening the partnership, it hoped to achieve connectivity for Grab's rental car fleet across Southeast Asia and offer financing, insurance and maintenance services to drivers based on data collected on its platform. \"Going forward, together with Grab, we will develop services that are more attractive, safe and secure for our customers in Southeast Asia,\" Toyota executive Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement. Data collected from the recorders could also help Toyota in its own development of next-generation mobility services, including a self-driving electric vehicle it plans to develop for companies to use for tasks such as ride hailing, package delivery and mobile shops. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd have also previously funded Grab, which said it has achieved run-rate revenue of over US$1 billion. The company's app has been downloaded onto over 100 million mobile devices and the firm logs over 6 million rides per day. Earlier this year, Uber exchanged its Southeast Asian operations for 27.5 percent of Singapore-headquartered grab, ending a battle between the two for regional dominance. Southeast Asia, home to about 640 million people, is a major arena for tech firms offering services from digital payments and ride-hailing to e-commerce. Last month, Indonesian ride-hailing and online payment firm Go-Jek said it would enter Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines in the next few months, investing US$500 million in its international push.

All local businesses and retailers are waiting is for World Cup fever to grip the nation. With the 2018 Fifa World Cup set to kick off in Russia on Thursday (Jun 14), businesses and retailers here are pulling out all stops to capitalise on the quadrennial football extravaganza. From extending their operating hours, installing more television screens at their premises, stocking up on products, to building their marketing and promotions plans around the month-long event, businesses are hoping to get that extra boost to their bottom lines through the tournament. Popular bar and dining chain Harry’s, which will show all 64 matches at most of its 21 outlets, are targeting a 20 per cent rise in revenue. Ditto Muddy Murphy Holdings, whose four sports bars — Muddy Murphy’s Irish Pub, The Penny Black London Pub, and Prince of Wales Backpacker Pubs in Boat Quay and Little India — are projecting a 30 per cent hike in business. Their optimism stems from a simple reason: Match timings. MATCH TIMINGS The previous three editions of the World Cup — Germany 2006, South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 — have seen most matches being played in rather ungodly hours in Singapore. Ordinary fans were reluctant to venture out to bars beyond midnight on weekdays just to catch some World Cup action. In those years, many chose to enjoy the World Cup experience at home. This year, it’s different. Russia is closer to Asia than other European countries, and the time difference, a mere five hours behind, is much more palatable for the ordinary fan. The late games — just 17 out of 64 — start at 2am Singapore time. The rest will be played between 6pm and midnight. Having World Cup football on prime time television is a big factor why local pubs and eateries are sparing no efforts in bringing the best World Cup experience to their patrons. “The timings of the games this year are just nice. We can incorporate the games into our entertainment programme that runs from 6pm to 4am on weekends,” said 1-Altitude general manager Ian Sim, whose al-fresco bar at One Raffles Place will be screening the World Cup for the first time. A Harry’s spokesperson agreed, saying: “The World Cup is an exciting time for us as it only takes place once every four years. Most matches (this year) start in the evening, after office work hours. With this year’s favourable timings, we are looking forward to a bigger turn-out. The chain said the projected 20 per cent increase in revenue will more than make up for the costs of television broadcast packages, liquor licences, additional food and drink supplies, and additional manpower needed for their extended operating hours. The bars under the Muddy Murphy stable have installed six to eight big television screens at their premises, bracing itself for a 30 per cent increase in footfalls. “The World Cup really brings people from all walks of life together in excitement,” said Mr Bjorn Seegers, director of Muddy Murphy Holdings, whose Claymore Road outlet has screened four World Cup tournaments since 2002. “It’s controlled rowdiness. There is a lot of spectator jeering, shouting. Of course, it is a pub so we expect that. That’s what people come for.” Newer establishments, like Cafe Football Singapore which opened early last year at Woodleigh Park, are also muscling in for a piece of the pie. Owned by former Manchester United stars Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, the football-themed restaurant has fully decorated its interior with World Cup jerseys and flags, on top of its United-dominated memorabilia — hoping to offer fans a different visual experience. In order to entice customers, establishments are dangling various promotions and special events. These include deals on food and alcohol leading up to and during the matches, as well as mini competitions such as guessing the first player to score a goal during a game and scoring a free pint. Football-themed menus and special cocktails are also being concocted in numerous restaurants and bars. Fast-food chain McDonald’s, which has shown World Cup matches here since 2006, has introduced such as Chicken Pizza Kicks and returning favourite Sausage McGriddles just for this World Cup period. RETAIL BOOST The food and beverage industry is not the only one that stands to benefit from the World Cup. Retailers are in for a windfall as fans have been parting with their cash for the latest jerseys, memorabilia and, make no mistake, football stickers. Sports retailers said that the tournament usually brings in an extra 30 to 200 per cent in sales. So far, the kits of traditional powerhouses like Germany and Brazil have been in high demand. Also popular among shoppers are Nigeria’s colourful home jersey and the crimson Egyptian team shirt donned by star forward Mohamed Salah. The jerseys usually cost upwards of S$100, depending on how one customises them with players’ names and tournament patches, but fans are not batting an eyelid. “I’ve been a big Germany supporter since the 1970s and now my whole family are following their fortunes at this World Cup,” said Mr Jason Cheong, 54, who bought five of the latest German kit for his whole family. The design is nice and we are proud to wear it and show our colours. Demand for stickers with images of the World Cup players are also rising since they started retailing here in April. Mr Navin Nambiar, a sticker collector and one of the administrators of the Facebook group Panini Swapsies Group - Singapore, said that most of the stickers have been sold out in 7-11 convenience stores. They can also be found at Buzz convenience stores and Premier Football outlets, among other locations. Collectors seek to fill up their album — priced at S$3.90 — with the stickers of 682 players, managers and special “shiny” editions representing the 32 participating nations. Packets of five stickers retail for S$1.20 each. Alternatively, boxes of 50 packets go for S$60. The closed Facebook group, now with more than 600 members, has tripled in size since the 2014 World Cup. The group facilitates the swapping of stickers among fans, and organises the occasional swap meet. Mr Navin attributed this growth to “unexpected demand” following the 2016 Uefa European Championship. “The distributors (of the stickers) are trying to bring in more stock now because it’s selling so fast,” the 37-year-old said. BROADCASTS ABOUND While consumers have shown willingness to spend during past editions of major football tournaments, a constant bugbear is the ever-increasing TV subscription fees for these games. This year, three local broadcasters — Mediacorp’s Toggle, Singtel and StarHub — announced in April that they are teaming up for the first time to bring a complete World Cup coverage to Singapore. The price of S$112.35 — a package which allows fans to access the broadcast from their television sets and mobile devices — is unchanged from what fans have had to pay during the European Championships in 2016. But it is the added value that is the game-clincher. For example, Mediacorp will also be screening nine matches, including the semi-finals and final, on their free-to-air okto channel — five more than previous years. The package also gives fans access to a comprehensive World Cup site offering insights like team profiles, player information, the latest scores, rankings and match highlights, on top of a studio show “capturing all the action and drama of the World Cup”, which will be shown on the three broadcasters’ channels every match night. The show will feature extended live feeds from the stadium and analysis of key moments with football personalities pre-match, at half-time and post-match. Parts of the presentation will be enhanced with augmented reality, Mediacorp said. “For once, there is no price increase. And we can view the matches on our mobile devices anytime we want so I think it’s good value for money,” said fan Alexandria Lee, 42. The World Cup happens once every four years so I’m happy to pay for it. I don’t want to miss out. While Mediacorp declined to reveal the number of subscriptions it has secured so far, its head of digital products and technology Anil Nihalani said the take-up rate has been “good”. “We continue to see strong interest as the clock ticks closer to the opening match,” added Mr Anil. Mr Goh Seow Eng, Singtel’s managing director of Home and Consumer Singapore, said that they are seeing “strong take-up of our Fifa World Cup packs”. “We urge fans to sign up at their earliest convenience to avoid the last minute rush before kick-off on June 14,” he added. On the corporate end, prices of World Cup business television packages have also remained unchanged since 2014. The standard screen package costs S$3,090.16 with Goods and Services Tax (GST), and S$2020.16 with GST for each additional screen. For larger screens of between 51 and 99 inches, the price comes in at S$5,230.16 with GST, and S$3,090.16 with GST for each additional screen. Despite the subscription prices holding steady, some coffee shops said that they are not planning to screen the matches, mostly because of noise complaints from residents living close by. Mr Andy Wong, owner of Wan Jin Coffeeshop in Serangoon, said he has not signed up for the World Cup package since 2010. “We had many complaints from the block upstairs about the ruckus during the World Cup… Now, you also can’t buy beer after 10.30pm. It doesn’t benefit us,” he said in Mandarin. Chairman of the Foochow Coffee Restaurant and Bar Merchants Association Hong Poh Hin said that most of the 400 coffee shops under the association have also been deterred by complaints from residents. Only “a few” 24-hour ones have subscribed to the World Cup package. “If you’re not running 24 hours, what is the point?” he added. Over at Tang Tea House, its vice-chairman Sylvia Ler said that they used to screen World Cup matches every year at the Simpang Bedok outlet, up till this year. The Land Transport Authority has banned them from placing additional chairs on the road outside the eatery for fans to sit and watch the games from. Ms Ler added that they are still contemplating whether to screen matches at the newly-opened Changi Village outlet, where they show games from European football leagues. Tang Tea House has two other eateries at Jalan Kayu and Jurong West. However, she said it may not be financially worth it, given that the Changi Village outlet closes at 2am on weekends and midnight on weekdays. “We can’t show all the matches but we still pay the same price for the package,” she said. We would open later last time till the matches finished, and it took a toll on our workers. ONE FOR THE COMMUNITY For some, the value of the World Cup is more than just boosting the bottom line. Football, after all, is widely regarded as a social glue that brings people together. And entities like People’s Association (PA) recognise that. On Monday (June 4), the PA announced that fans can follow the action at 55 Community Clubs (CCs) and Our Tampines Hub (OTH). Fans can also catch live screenings at the Sports Hub’s OCBC Square, all six Safra clubs, and Changi Airport’s Terminal 3. A PA spokesperson said that, given the favourable match timings, the organisation expects a total turnout of at least 600,000 fans compared to about 570,000 in 2014. They had started screening matches at 30 CCs back then, the spokesperson said, but the number almost doubled to 58 when more CCs came on board following “overwhelming response”. “Watching World Cup at the CCs with your neighbours is as close an experience as we Pioneer Generation can get in the 1970s, when residents come together to watch television downstairs,” said a 67-year-old retiree living in Tampines who only wanted to be known as Madam Tan. “It’s a throwback to simpler times, when people communicate more, socialise more, regardless of race, language or religion.” “I’m really looking forward to this. Even though I know nothing about football.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-singapore-business-retailers-gearing-up-world-cup-10419130"}, {"datetime": "13 Jun 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["robots", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "engineering", "NTU", "technology"], "author": "Hallam Stevens", "title": "Commentary: A while more before robots and artificial intelligence run our lives for us", "content": " SINGAPORE: The last several months have seen Singapore swept up in an enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI). In April, NTU engineers succeeded in building a robot that could assemble an IKEA chair. And over the last few months we’ve heard much about “Nadine” – an AI with a human face, designed to respond to human speech and emotions. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently flagged AI as an area Singapore is making good progress developing frontier technologies in, noting especially Alibaba’s establishment of a joint research institute at NTU. But beyond these headline-making, attention-grabbing events, how likely is it that AI will be transforming our lives in the near future? SOLUTION TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS?  The discussion about AI is almost always dominated by either “techno-optimists” or the “doomsayers”. For the former, AI will solve all the world’s problems, bringing wealth, new jobs, new industries, and even strengthen social cohesion; for the latter, robots pose a threat to people’s livelihoods and ways of life.  But both these views take on faith the underlying idea that AI is coming, sooner or later, like it or not. These positions leave very little room for reasoned consideration of how transformative AI may really be. Despite AI’s widely publicised successes, there are very good reasons to be skeptical about its possibilities for replacing humans. The history of AI is hardly a history of triumph. Since the first electronic computers were built during World War II, their creators thought of them as giant electronic brains, promising that they would soon be painting great works of art, solving mathematical proofs, and directing armies into battle. Very little of this materialised. The early pioneers of AI in the 1950s and 1960s soon came to understand how difficult building “thinking machines” could actually be. READ: The future of work, a dystopian reality? A commentary. READ: Smart speakers will take over the world? Don’t make me laugh, a commentary. EMERGING DIFFICULTIES Sure, AI has made progress since then – it can now beat humans at Go and chess and help us find our way to the nearest supermarket or movie theatre. But history suggests we should be cautious about extrapolating too far from these beginnings to draw straight line conclusions about the pervasiveness of AI in our lives. Games with very clear rules and boundaries are one thing. But, as the problems with autonomous vehicles are beginning to show, dealing with the openness of real world situations is quite a different matter. City streets – filled with pedestrians, children playing football, bicycles, and parades – are a far cry from a chess board. Both personal and national security increasingly rely on AI-driven technologies of facial recognition. But recent reports have suggested that such technologies are plagued with difficulties. Reports from China suggest that the iPhone X cannot distinguish between the faces of some ethnic Chinese people. Other facial recognition schemes have completely failed to identify individuals with darker skin tones, differentiate between twins or recognise someone who has changed their make-up. Even in the realm of linguistic communication, AI has experienced some revealing difficulties. Microsoft’s chatbot “Tay” had to be shut down after developing a penchant for racist remarks; and Facebook’s “Bob” and “Alice,” despite being programmed to communicate in English, seemed to generate their own private language.  READ: Driverless vehicles can reshape Singapore but consider the human elements, a commentary. READ: The powerful edge of humanity in a world of machines, a commentary. We also need to ensure that the promises of AI do not distract us from pursuing other kinds of solutions to social and economic problems. For example, Singapore has invested in AI and smart city systems as a solution to the problem of an ageing population, including devices to monitor elderly citizens in their homes. But this seems unlikely to be a panacea – such efforts should go hand in hand with the training of elderly care workers and investment in aged care facilities. Sensors and smart devices need to connect the elderly to real people who can provide human care in a sustainable and scalable manner. Rather than giving in to premature triumphalism or panicking about robots taking our jobs, Singapore should be thinking about how AI research might be most productively channeled into fields where it has the greatest potential. This approach will allow Singapore to become a useful use case study for other cities and nations that are also trying to figure out also how to unlock AI’s potential.

Trump's signature, by contrast, indicates a more guarded personality, they said. Graphologist Koo Bon-jin said Kim's signature suggested an ambitious man who is \"intuitive, rather than rational and logical\". \"He also writes very fast, which indicates he's quick-witted and impatient,\" Koo added. Kim's signature contrasts with Trump's angular, closely packed autograph, said Karen Leong, a body language expert and director of Singapore-based consultants Influence Solutions. \"There is tremendous space between each character, which indicates a creative individual who is open to taking on new ideas, to evolving,\" Leong said of Kim's signature. \"It indicates a confident person with big dreams and ambitions.\" Trump's signature, which Leong said looked like \"arrows or skyscrapers\", points to people who \"tend to wear a mask to hide their true nature\". \"While both signatures are very different, as both men really have different personalities, both in their own way want to make their mark,\" she added. Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean military officer who heads the World Institute for North Korea Studies in Seoul, said Kim's slanting signature was similar to those of his father and grandfather, both former leaders of North Korea. \"Not just the Kim family, but ordinary North Koreans would try hard to imitate the handwriting, believing it's nice and divine,\" added Ahn, who defected to South Korea in 1979.

The video, which was about four minutes long, was shown by Mr Trump to Mr Kim on Tuesday when the two leaders met. It was also aired - in both a Korean and an English version - before Mr Trump gave a press briefing later that day.  In the video, a dramatic Hollywood-style voiceover described \"a story of opportunity\", featuring \"two men, two leaders, one destiny\" over montages of various scenes of Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Produced like a movie trailer, it described \"a story about a special moment in time, when a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated\". \"A new world can begin today,\" the voiceover promised. \"One of friendship, respect and goodwill. Be part of that world, where the doors of opportunity are ready to be opened.\"  At one point, the video featured a montage with babies and automobile factories, suggesting what a more prosperous future for North Korea could look like if it agreed to scrap its nuclear arsenal. To illustrate the point, ballistic missiles were shown in reverse motion, pulling back into their launch silos. The video appeared to address Mr Kim directly, suggesting he could make a choice that would open North Korea to new investment and step into a starring role in a moment in history with Trump. \"Featuring President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un, in a meeting to remake history, to shine in the sun. One moment, one choice,\" the narrator said. It also featured a few landmarks in Singapore, including a shot that looked like Marina Bay Sands going up in smoke. Speaking to reporters, Mr Trump said he thought the North Korean leader \"loved\" the video. \"I showed it to him today, towards the end of the meeting and I think he loved it,\" he said. \"That could very well be the future (of North Korea),\" he said. \"The other alternative is just not a very good alternative. I showed it because I really want him to do something.\" The US president said on Tuesday that the two countries were \"ready to write a new chapter\" and would move towards denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.

The momentous event was succinctly captured through photographs by the media at the scene. Here are some of the best shots that emerged during the unprecedented event.  LANDMARK HANDSHAKE Mr Trump and Mr Kim shared a landmark handshake at about 9am Tuesday morning at the Capella hotel in front of a display of North Korean and US flags, ahead of their meeting.  This is the first time a sitting US president has met with a North Korean leader. Ahead of the meeting, both leaders looked to be in good spirits. Mr Trump reaffirmed this later on by calling the summit \"very, very good\" and said that he had developed a \"very special bond\" with Mr Kim. Both leaders were seen seated together before the meeting commenced. \"It’s my honour ... We will have a terrific relationship I have no doubt,\" said Mr Trump ahead of the summit. REACTIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD The summit has ramifications not just for North Korea and the US, but the world at large. Leaders from all around the world expressed their hopes for the outcome of the summit, including South Korean President Moon Jae-in. \"I, along with all our people, sincerely hope that it will be a successful summit that will open a new era of complete denuclearisation, peace and a new relationship between South Korea, North Korea and the United States,\" he said. People from all over the world also felt the effects of the momentous summit. This photograph captures people in the South Korean capital Seoul, gathered at railway stations and across various locations for public screenings of the landmark summit.   DEAL OR NO DEAL? After his meeting with Mr Kim, Mr Trump assessed the progress made in this way: \"A lot of progress, really very positive - better than anybody could have expected. \"We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time,\" said Mr Trump following the summit about his meeting with Mr Kim. Following the closed-door meeting, Mr Kim appeared to be in high spirits shortly before signing a document signalling North Korea's commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.  At around 1.40pm, the leaders emerged along with key officials to sign the document that had four main points. Among them: Joint efforts to build a “lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula”. Earlier on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that: \"The complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept.\" Mr Trump said that Mr Kim agreed to the destruction of a missile engine testing site after the signing of agreement at the summit. The signed document promises a new relationship between the two countries and commits North Korea to working towards getting rid of its nuclear weapons. Mr Trump added in a post-summit press conference that he was confident Mr Kim would start the process of denuclearisation.  \"Chairman Kim is on his way back to North Korea and I know for a fact as soon as he arrives, he is going to start a process that is going to make people very happy and very safe,\" said Mr Trump. \"I just feel very strongly ... that they want to make a deal,\" said Mr Trump after the summit, echoing his previous sentiments that the talks were\"honest, direct and productive\". \"I'll do whatever it takes to make the world a safer place,\" added Trump to the media during a press conference. It was a largely positive summit that appears to have yielded favourable outcomes, but it remains to be seen if the commitments made during the summit will be upheld.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/in-pictures-a-walk-through-the-historic-trump-kim-summit-10423548"}, {"datetime": "12 Jun 2018 04:50PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un"], "author": "", "title": "US, North Korea 'ready to write a new chapter': Donald Trump", "content": " SINGAPORE: After decades of hostilities, the United States and North Korea are ready to write a new chapter in their relations, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday (Jun 12), at the end of a landmark summit which saw the reclusive state's leader commit to a complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has the potential to be a \"great place\", Mr Trump said, adding that there is \"no limit\" to what the country can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce.  He said this at a press conference that stretched for more than an hour as he wrapped up his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Tuesday (Jun 12). Just hours earlier, the two leaders had signed a joint document in which Mr Kim reaffirmed his \"firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\".  Mr Trump also committed to provide security guarantees to North Korea, without stating what those guarantees might be.  The two parties also said they would jointly work to build a \"lasting and stable\" peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. Mr Trump said his talks with Mr Kim were \"honest, direct and productive\".  \"We are prepared to start a new history and we are ready to write a new chapter between our nations,\" he said.  The US president said that Tuesday was the start of an \"arduous process\" but that \"peace is always worth the effort\".  \"Anyone can make war but only the most courageous can make peace. The current state of affairs cannot endure forever,\" he added.  The North Korean leader, he added, has \"an opportunity like no other to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people\". Responding to questions from the media, Mr Trump also expressed confidence that Mr Kim would honour the commitments he had made. \"(Mr Kim) was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this. I think he might want to do this as much or even more than me as they see a very bright future for North Korea,\" he said.  \"We signed a very comprehensive document today and I believe he's going to live up to that document. When he lands, I think he will start that process right away ... We have a great team. I think he wants to get it done.\" Mr Trump said during the signing ceremony that he and Mr Kim had \"developed a special bond\".  Earlier in the day, the two leaders walked across the aisles towards each other at the Capella Hotel in Singapore's Sentosa island and shook hands as the world watched. US TO STOP “WAR GAMES” In his speech on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that he will travel to Pyongyang in the future and will invite Mr Kim to the White House \"at the appropriate time\".  He also said that US would be “stopping the war games\", referring to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has repeatedly said were an act of war. “They're tremendously expensive, the amount of money that we spend on that is incredible. South Korea contributes but not 100 per cent ... The war games are very expensive, we pay for a great majority of them, we fly in bombers from Guam ... it's a very provocative situation.” While North Korea has a “very substantial” nuclear arsenal, the denuclearisation process will begin “very, very soon” and will be done as fast as it can “mechanically and physically be done”, Mr Trump said in response to questions.  Mr Kim already agreed to destroy a missile engine testing site after the signing of the agreement, Mr Trump said.  “Scientifically you have to wait certain periods of time,” he stated. “Despite that, once you start the process it means it's pretty much over.” Asked by Channel NewsAsia about the cost of denuclearisation, Mr Trump said he thinks South Korea and Japan will help \"very greatly\" in North Korea's development. Mr Trump added: \"We won't have to help them\". The US President also said that the difference between the document signed with Mr Kim and previous agreements signed between US leaders and North Korea was that it was “very important” to the current administration. “The other groups, maybe it wasn’t a priority … and it would’ve been easier back then. I'm not just blaming President Obama, this goes back 25 years. It should've happened.” The sanctions the US has imposed on North Korea will remain but Mr Trump said that he looks forward to removing them. \"The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor ... They'll come off when we know we're down the road, where it's not going to happen - nothing's going to happen.\" FURTHER TALKS IN THE PIPELINE? Mr Trump also said that he would \"come back gladly\" to Singapore, thanking Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, whom he met on Monday and had described earlier in his speech as a \"friend of mine\".  \"Your prime minister was fantastic ... he's done a great job. He was really welcoming ... it probably made a difference, actually.\" On next steps, the US President said that his administration, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton, would be getting together next week to \"go over the details and to get this stuff done\".  \"We're also working very much with South Korea, we're working with Japan, we're working with China to a lesser extent, but we're working with China,\" he added.  \"We've done a good job but if you don't get the ball over the goal line, it doesn't mean enough,\" he said.  We’re live on YouTube with our comprehensive coverage on the Trump-Kim summit.

The burger giveaway at noon was the hotel’s way of commemorating the historic meeting between Trump and Kim - the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. The buzz surrounding the summit has grown steadily since last week, with local businesses capitalizing on the hype.  Among the offerings have been the Trump-Kim Chi Nasi Lemak, the El Trumpo (Cheeseburger) and Rocket Man (Korean Fried Chicken) tacos, as well as the “Bromance”, a pair of drinks consisting of Asahi beer, diet Coke, Tequila and white grape soju, created by local bar Hopheads as a tribute to the Singapore summit. A promotional event with Trump and Kim lookalikes Howard X and Dennis Alan on Saturday (Jun 9) saw hundreds of Singaporeans turn up at Bugis Junction, with some even forking out S$15 for pictures with the lookalikes. Retiree Sue Dharan was the first in line for the free burgers, having queued for close to 30 minutes. “I hope it (the meeting) is something to benefit the whole world as we work towards peace and a better world for our younger generation,” she told Channel NewsAsia. “I’m looking at the positive side of things, and from what I’ve read, it seems that the one-on-one meeting was very, very good from Mr Trump’s point of view,” she said. “We should be very proud of this moment because it’s a once-in-a lifetime one.” Consisting of minced chicken and kimchi patty, seaweed, the mini Trump-Kim burger was a hit with most, with the 250 burgers to be given away snapped up within 20 minutes. “We wanted to celebrate ‘Summit Day’ with Singaporeans and tourists,” said Royal Plaza on Scotts general manager Patrick Fiat. “It is a fusion, a start of a new friendship, a balance between North Korea and the US living in harmony, (displayed through) food and the summit.”  The hotel had earlier in the week launched the Trump-Kim Burger and the Summit Iced Tea, priced at S$12 and S$6 respectively, in commemoration of the summit. Student Ric Chan travelled from Sengkang to sample the free mini-burger. “It tastes a little spicy, but overall it’s really good and tasty, “said Mr Chan, who came dressed in a black DMZ t-shirt with flags of both North and South Korea. Another passer-by who only wanted to be known as Mr Chan C S, happened to be in the area and decided to queue for the mini Trump-Kim burger, just before the giveaway ended.

In a press release on Tuesday (Jan 12), the firm said Singapore was ranked 20th most expensive in the world and ninth in the Asia Pacific region for expatriates. In the same survey published in December, Singapore was ranked 21st most expensive globally and ninth in the Asia Pacific. In June last year, Singapore was ranked 24th most expensive globally and 10th in the Asia Pacific. The highest Singapore has featured in the ranking was at 18th place globally  in 2016.  “The price of goods and services included in our basket of goods has only seen modest increase in Singapore over the past 12 months, in line with other similar economies in Asia,” said ECA International's regional director for Asia Lee Quane.   “However, the rise in the rankings has been due to the relative strength of the Singapore dollar versus the US greenback in the past year,\" he added.  Tokyo is the most expensive location in the region for expatriates.   Hong Kong's ranking fell significantly from second to 11th place, its lowest since 2015. The main reason, according to Mr Quane, was the fall in value of the US dollar, against which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged, over the last year.  Noting that Tokyo's global ranking has remained relatively static in the past few years - staying in seventh place in the latest rankings - Mr Quane said that it was only the yen’s relative strength against the US dollar that has seen the Japanese capital overtake Hong Kong to become the most expensive place in Asia for foreigners to live and work. Meanwhile, skyrocketing inflation in Venezuela has propelled its capital Caracas to the top of the global rankings, overtaking all cities in Switzerland and last year’s most expensive location, Angolan capital Luanda. \"The economic situation in Venezuela has become increasingly volatile with inflation reaching an astounding 7,000 per cent in the year to March 2018 and 1,800 per cent over the last six months alone,\" Mr Quane said.  ECA International said in the press release that the twice-yearly survey is to help companies calculate cost of living allowances so that their employees' spending power is not compromised while on international assignments.  The surveys compare a basket of like-for-like consumer goods and services commonly purchased by assignees in 475 locations worldwide, excluding certain living costs such as accommodation and school fees, which are usually covered by separate allowances.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-20th-most-expensive-city-in-the-world-for-expats-10421000"}, {"datetime": "12 Jun 2018 11:05AM", "tags": ["Kim Jong Un", "Donald Trump", "Dennis Rodman"], "author": "", "title": "'Trust each other first': Dennis Rodman watches Trump-Kim summit from Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: Basketball star Dennis Rodman was in Singapore on Tuesday (Jun 12) in a show of support for the historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Rodman made the news in recent years for his unlikely friendship with the basketball-loving North Korean leader, and has made five trips to Pyongyang since Kim took power.

South Korean visitors looking at North Korean territory from Odusan Unification Observatory in the border city of Paju said they hoped to live \"happy\" with North Korean people through a successful summit. Spontaneous applause broke out the moment Kim and Trump stepped out and greeted one another with a cordial handshake.  Giant screens at prominent buildings around Seoul also broadcast the meeting, with many stopping to soak in the momentous nature of the event.  South Korea's Yonhap news agency showed President Moon Jae-in smiling at the moment Trump and Kim shook hands.  \"The North Korea-US summit has now started,\" Yonhap quoted Moon as saying during a Cabinet meeting. \"I guess the attention of all our people must currently be directed toward Singapore.\" He added: \"I spent a sleepless night.

At the signing, both Kim and Trump expressed satisfaction at how their landmark meeting went - with the US leader saying it was \"better than expected\" as they negotiated an end to a decades-old stand-off.  Kim said the \"world will now see a major change\" following the Singapore summit. The pair signed what Trump called a \"pretty comprehensive\" and \"very important\" document, which spoke of \"new US-DPRK relations\" and committed Washington to \"security guarantees\". When asked about denuclearisation Trump said \"we're starting that process\", adding that it would begin \"very, very quickly.\" SUMMIT STARTS WITH HANDSHAKE The historic first handshake took place at 9.05am at the Capella hotel in Sentosa, in front of a display of North Korean and US flags. Both Trump and Kim smiled and exchanged pleasantries before posing for photographs.  They then adjourned to a sitting room where both Trump and Kim fielded questions. Trump spoke first and said: \"It’s my honour ... We will have a terrific relationship I have no doubt.\" Speaking in Korean, Kim said that \"it was not easy to get here\" and \"the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today\".  The leaders then proceeded to have a one-on-one meeting with only their translators present, before stepping out after around 40 minutes to wave at the assembled media from a balcony.  The US president described his private meeting with Kim as \"very good, very very good\". They were later joined by their delegations for a series of meetings. \"Working together we will get it taken care of,\" Trump told Kim at the start of the wider meeting. \"We will solve it.\" Both sides proceeded to have a scheduled working lunch after their meetings. Among the dishes for lunch were prawn cocktail, Yangzhou fried rice and beef short rib confit.  Oiseon, a Korean stuffed cucumber, was served for starters, and Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate tartlet ganache were served for dessert. \"A lot of progress, really very positive - better than anybody could have expected,\" Trump told the media after his lunch meeting with Kim as they strolled out of the hotel side by side. \"Top of the line, really good.\" He then added that he and Kim would be signing a document at the Singapore summit.  The two leaders even spent a short moment without their translators as they tried to build rapport between themselves. Trump even showed Kim his presidential limo, dubbed The Beast.  \"THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR CHANGE\": KIM At around 1.40pm, the leaders emerged along with key officials to sign a document.  \"A lot of work and a lot of preparation went into this,\" said Trump. \"The meeting went better than expected and no one could've expected this.\" Kim expressed thanks to the US president for the summit's success.  \"We had a historic meeting and we’ve decided to leave the past behind,\" he said. \"The world will see a major change. I would like to express my gratitude to President Donald Trump for making this happen.\" Both leaders shook hands again at the signing table with Trump saying he had developed a \"special bond\" with his younger counterpart.  Asked by reporters if he would invite Kim to Washington, Trump said: \"Absolutely, I would.\"  As both leaders stood on the verandah before Kim's departure from the Capella hotel, Trump said: \"We'll meet again. We will meet many times.\" The president added that he learned Kim is a \"very talented man\" and \"loves his country very much\". Trump said Kim was a \"worthy negotiator\", adding the North Korean leader had a \"great personality\" and was \"very smart\".  In a post-summit press conference which began at around 4.15pm, Trump spoke to the international media where he said the US will stop holding military exercises on the Korean Peninsula. Washington and Seoul are security allies and hold joint exercises every year that infuriate Pyongyang. \"We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money,\" Trump told reporters, adding that \"at some point\" he wanted to withdraw US troops from the South. Trump also added that Kim was committed to destroy a missile engine testing site, but did not elaborate further, except to say that this was agreed after the pair signed their \"comprehensive agreement\" earlier in the afternoon. On the issue of human rights, Trump said he had raised it during his meeting with Kim. \"We did discuss it today, strongly\" Trump said. \"We will be doing something on it. It's rough. It's rough in a lot of places, by the way.\" On denuclearisation, Trump said North Korea has “very substantial” nuclear arsenal, but believes the time on denuclearisation will “go very quickly”. Asked by Channel NewsAsia about the cost for denuclearisation for North Korea, Trump said he think South Korea and Japan will help them \"greatly\", says \"we won't have to help them\". Sanctions however, would remain on North Korea for now, but Trump said he wants to remove them as soon as possible. \"The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor,\" Trump said. \"I hope it is soon ... at a certain point I look forward to taking them off.\" A HISTORIC DAY UNFOLDS Anticipation had been building in the lead-up to the unprecedented summit, with crowds lining the streets of Singapore when they arrived on Sunday. Both leaders left their hotels in the Orchard area of Singapore shortly after 8am local time on Tuesday as they headed for Sentosa, which is off Singapore’s southern coast. The route was lined by curious on-lookers and the media, with people standing three- to four-deep in some parts taking photos and waving as they craned to catch a glimpse of the leaders.   Trump, who left at around 8.05am from the Shangri-La Hotel, tweeted en route to the summit venue on a US Supreme Court ruling. Kim left the St Regis hotel shortly before 8.15am as his convoy – comprising about 20 security, North Korean state media and official vehicles – made its way to Sentosa. Crowds also camped out at VivoCity, outside the Sentosa Gateway, and on pavements in Sentosa to take photos and wave at the passing convoys of both leaders. Kim arrived for the meeting with his sister and confidante Kim Yo Jong and his trusted aide Kim Chang Son. As the two leaders met, Singapore navy vessels and air force Apache helicopters patrolled, while fighter jets and an Gulfstream 550 early warning aircraft circled. TRUMP BEGAN DAY ON OPTIMISTIC NOTE The extraordinary summit - unthinkable only months ago - comes after the two nuclear-armed foes appeared on the verge of conflict late last year as they slung personal insults and Kim conducted nuclear and missile tests. In a series of tweets early Tuesday morning Singapore time, Trump indicated that summit preparations were \"going well and quickly\". \"We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen,\" he tweeted - before hitting out in a subsequent post at \"haters & losers\" who see the summit itself as a risky up-front concession to Kim. Pointing at the recent release of three American hostages and Pyongyang's pledge to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests, Trump charged that \"these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say!\" \"We will be fine!\" he tweeted. Trump had also said that he would use what he says are long-honed instincts to see whether Kim was bluffing, buying time or serious.  Both Kim and Trump held bilateral talks with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday, when the US president also met with the American community in Singapore at the Shangri-La Hotel. Prime Minister Lee had on Sunday said that Singapore will spend S$20 million on the summit, adding that he hoped the historic meeting would result in a positive outcome. Kim took in the sights of the city on Monday night as he visited Gardens by the Bay and walked along the Marina Bay waterfront. He was accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards and North Korean state media personnel, as well as Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung. Since becoming North Korea's leader in late 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jong Il, Kim had made only three known international trips before his Singapore trip. He travelled to China twice and to the South Korean side of the truce village of Panmunjom. DEAL REMAINS TO BE SEEN On the eve of the meeting, aides from both sides were still scrambling to narrow yawning differences over \"denuclearisation\", which means vastly different things to the two parties. \"The complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the eve of the summit. Pompeo added that the US was willing to offer the regime \"unique\" security guarantees, to \"provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearisation is not something that ends badly for them\".

Kim said Singapore was \"clean and beautiful\", while looking at the view on Monday from the observation deck of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, adding that he had learned much about the Southeast Asian nation's economic potential and how it had developed, the official KCNA news agency said. Kim went on an evening tour, posing with Singapore officials at a tropical garden before visiting an infinity pool atop a landmark waterfront hotel, to the surprise of guests. Kim arrived in Singapore on Sunday for a historic summit with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and missiles in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees. The young North Korean leader is staying under heavy guard at a city centre hotel and had not appeared in public on Monday until about 9.00pm, when one of his security officials buzzing about the hotel lobby shouted \"It's all ready!\". Kim suddenly emerged in his trademark Mao-style suit to walk out to his black limousine, accompanied by his sister, Kim Yo Jong, and aides. Reuters staff around the city tracked his motorcade, which included bus loads of security personnel and aides, escorted by dozens of Singapore police officers on motorbikes. His first stop was a park with futuristic, tree-shaped installations, Gardens by the Bay, which also boasts the largest glass greenhouse and tallest indoor waterfall in the world. He joined Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who tweeted a selfie with a smiling Kim and Singapore Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, against a backdrop of flowers with the hashtag #Guesswhere. Kim thanked the Singapore officials for showing him around so late at night, the North's state news agency said on Tuesday. Kim then stopped at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which resembles a giant surfboard perched on three tall columns, for a look out over the bright city lights from its rooftop garden and infinity swimming pool. Singapore was \"clean and beautiful\", Kim said on the observation deck, adding that he aimed to learn from the knowledge and experience of the southeast Asian nation, as he found it impressive, the official KCNA news agency added. Surprised guests enjoying the relative cool of the tropical evening took pictures of a waving Kim with their cameraphones. On the way back to his hotel, Kim walked along a promenade near the Merlion, a giant statue, and fountain, of a mythical creature, half lion, half fish - Singapore's unofficial mascot. Kim's trip to Singapore is his furthest journey he has made since taking power in late 2011 upon his father's death. He has made two trips to China since March to meet President Xi Jinping, and held summit talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April and May in the Demilitarised Zone, which separates the two Koreas. His excursion out of the hotel caused a big stir with guests who were told to get behind a barricade while dozens of North Korean security men and Singapore police officers and government officials blocked off the lobby. \"Oh my God, is Kim Jong Un coming?\" shouted one guest, shortly before he appeared to set off for his evening jaunt.

When Ms Amanpour suggested that Singapore is quite far from the Korean Peninsular - 10 hours by plane - Mr Lee replied that the time taken to reach Singapore from North Korea is \"fewer by missile\". But he clarified that Singapore's concern is not that it will be a military target. \"If there are tensions in Northeast Asia on the Korean Peninsula, it is going to destabilise the region and Southeast Asia is not going to be let off scot-free, nor the world,\" he said.  \"I think if this meeting can have a constructive outcome, and we can have contributed something to that, I think it is a duty we should do.\" \"GIVE-AND-TAKE\" When asked for his views on Mr Trump and the summit, Mr Lee said: \"I think he is hoping for a positive outcome and the key thing is he needs to assess whether Mr Kim is serious or not.\" Elaborating, he said that if both sides are serious about wanting a deal, they have to be prepared to \"give-and-take\". \"Something can be worked out if you really want to come to an outcome. If you do not want an outcome, you just want a photo opportunity and then you go home and either you beat your chest and you declare victory on an empty document, or you go home and say 'the other guy, you cannot do business with him',\" he said. He also warned of further nuclearisation in East Asia and the world, if current tensions are not deescalated. South Korea and Japan have entertained the notion of having nuclear capabilities in the past, and it may not stop there, he said. \"The Taiwanese have nuclear-powered plants and they have thoughts too. It is very destabilising even if you confine yourself to East Asia,\" he said, adding that the Middle East countries will also be watching the precedents which are being set.  \"I think it can be very troublesome for the world,\" he added. SINGAPORE NOT \"REPRESSIVE\" Turning to Singapore, Ms Amanpour asked if the country will \"open up more\". Mr Lee replied that Singapore was not \"repressive\". \"Why is the political scene like that? Because that is the way Singaporeans have voted and it is an outcome of the elections,\" he said. Mr Lee added that Singaporeans can say or publish what they want, subject to the laws of sedition, libel and contempt. He corrected Ms Amanpour when she mentioned an \"American who was very heavily penalised for chewing gum\". \"Michael Fay was not (caned) for chewing gum. Michael Fay went around vandalising vehicles, scratching vehicles and causing a lot of damage. And he was caned for that. You do not get caned for chewing gum,\" Mr Lee said.

He was also seen at the Jubilee Bridge, which links the Merlion Park and the promenade in front of the Esplanade.  Kim Jong Un, Singapore ministers and an entourage of over 50 people were spotted at The Jubilee Bridge earlier tonight https://t.co/4miBt0BteL #TrumpKimSummit⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠ pic.twitter.com/4SFDUPMCbq  A flurry of activity was seen outside the St Regis Hotel where Mr Kim is staying as his motorcade left the hotel at around 9pm. His motorcade was seen returning to the hotel about two-and-a-half hours later. MERE HOURS TO PREPARE At rooftop bar Ce La Vi, which is located on the observation deck of Marina Bay Sands, general manger Sourav Biswas only had mere hours to prepare for the visit.  He said he was informed at about 6pm that a “VVIP” would be arriving later in the evening, and guessed that it could be the North Korean leader as they were “the biggest guests in town currently.”  He said he immediately connected with the MBS security team to find out more about the details of the North Korean leader's itinerary at MBS.  The establishment has 15 security staff on normal days; it mobilised 10 additional part-time staff for the visit. “It took about an hour and a half to prepare the logistics for the visit. Then the operations team had to brief the staff and made sure that security personnel were on standby at their respective locations at Ce La Vi,” said Mr Biswas.  He added that the venue was secured by 8.30pm. DISCREET SECURITY PREPARATIONS Channel NewsAsia was at the MBS SkyPark from about 7pm onwards and witnessed how the night unfolded.  Security staff were seen surveying the observation deck and gathered in quiet conversations from about 7.30pm onwards.  A guest later told Channel NewsAsia that he had overheard personnel say that Mr Kim would be arriving later, and that access to the deck would cease at 8pm - two hours earlier than usual. As the crowds thinned out, the remaining guests who only had tickets to the observation deck were asked to leave by about 8.45pm. Thereafter, staff were seen wiping fingerprints off glass panels and railings. Diners at Ce La Vi were allowed to stay throughout the night, and there was a palpable buzz as rumors spread among patrons that the North Korean leader would soon be arriving.  Guests who tried to take photos of security personnel on the observation deck were also stopped by staff who cited a “special security event.” A diner, 50-year-old Ashok Vasan, said he “couldn’t believe” the rumours in the bar until he saw the increase in security presence.  “Every now and then, there would be a hush and new groups of people will walk in, and people would think it was (Kim Jong Un). Obviously the anticipation started to build up, and by the time it reached the time he showed up, everyone was excited,” he said. Calling it “unbelievable”, Mr Vasan added, “(Kim is) probably one of the most important man in the world right now -  on one of the most historic meetings of the century, and he’s right there. I think it’s a special moment,” said Mr Vasan. Mr Kim and Mr Trump are scheduled to meet at Sentosa's Capella hotel on Tuesday. This will be the first time a sitting US president and a North Korean leader will meet face to face. Mr Kim met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday at the Istana, where the two discussed bilateral relations.

US President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Sentosa island on Tuesday for an unprecedented summit aimed at getting the North to give up its nuclear weapons. For the leader of isolated North Korea and his delegation of dozens of officials, state media workers and security staff, the rare foreign trip is an opportunity to build diplomatic bridges and to explore the capitalist successes in Singapore. The North Korean delegation is staying at the five-star St Regis hotel where the lobby has a cream-coloured marble floor, chandeliers and large artworks on the walls. The hotel's lavish S$47 per person buffet breakfast costs about the same as what most North Koreans earn in a month. Among the three dozen or so North Koreans seen at breakfast on Monday were some of the regime's most powerful men, usually only spotted by North Korea watchers in photographs published in state media as they line up at official events. Four-star general and vice chairman of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong Chol, party vice chairman and director of its International Affairs Department Ri Su Yong and foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, were among them. Hotel staff discouraged other guests from interacting with the North Koreans, or taking their photographs. North Korean media staff sampled Chinese dim sum, pastries and fried eggs and took souvenir photographs of each other in the grand dining hall. Such treats are unheard of for most North Koreans, even for government officials, who have seen their chances of overseas travel wither in recent years as their country's isolation has increased under sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programmes. Totalitarian North Korea's governing ideology of \"Juche\", which champions self-sufficiency, has brought little but decades of economic stagnation, widespread poverty and, at times, starvation. Most ordinary North Koreans rely on a monotonous diet of rice, corn, kimchi and bean paste, and they lack essential fats and protein, according to testimonies from defectors and from UN officials allowed to visit. The UN World Food Programme says a quarter of North Korean children under five, who attend nurseries that it supports, suffer from chronic malnutrition. MCDONALD'S AND STATIONERY On Sunday night, hours after Kim and his delegation arrived in Singapore, Reuters reporters saw North Korean officials, some wearing pin badges of their leaders, ordering US$100-plus-per-person dinners at the hotel's high-end Chinese restaurant. Others appeared to go for Western fast food. A group of North Korean security staff were seen coming back into the hotel with cardboard boxes, one with McDonald's takeaway. North Korea is one of the world's few countries without a McDonald's. Two North Korean officials, whose identity could not be confirmed, were seen returning from the shopping trip with bags from the NBC Stationery and Gifts shop. The North Koreans are staying on the top three floors of the St Regis, a Reuters reporter discovered. The upper floors have suites at more than S$5,000 a night and the Presidential Suite, at about S$9,000 a night, according to the hotel's website.  The Presidential Suite has a dining room, living room, study, bedroom and terrace, workout room, steam room, a butler service and kitchen. The St Regis declined to comment on who was staying on the top floors, or how many rooms the North Koreans were occupying. Reuters could not confirm if leader Kim was staying in the Presidential Suite. Singapore, doing its bit to promote peace, has said it expects to spend about S$20 million on hosting the summit, including the North Koreans' hotel bill, Singapore's foreign minister told the BBC.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/north-korea-delegation-enjoys-fruits-of-singapore-s-capitalism-10421056"}, {"datetime": "11 Jun 2018 09:00PM", "tags": ["Kim Jong Un", "Donald Trump", "Trump-Kim Summit"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Despite tight security and media scrum, business as usual around St Regis Hotel", "content": " SINGAPORE: When news emerged that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be staying at the St Regis Hotel, the manager of a nearby Starbucks joint thought the hordes of journalists camped out there would mean good business. While the manager, who did not want to be named, said \"plenty\" of journalists had patronised the outlet in Tanglin Mall ahead of the Trump-Kim summit on Tuesday (Jun 12), the numbers were not as large as he had expected. \"Business is about the same, just a slight rise,\" the manager told Channel NewsAsia on Monday. \"There are more people around the area but not a lot of them coming in.\" More than 2,500 journalists are in Singapore for the landmark summit, with United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim meeting at the Capella Hotel in Sentosa at 9am on Tuesday to discuss Pyongyang's denuclearisation. The media frenzy, along with the heightened security in the Tanglin area, had the potential to cause disruption, but businesses and passers-by said life went on largely as per normal. Dozens of journalists and camera crew, many donning hats and sunglasses in the 30 degrees Celsius heat, waited in front of the hotel, eager to catch any sign of Mr Kim. Police officers on partially-closed Tanglin Road checked vehicles headed for the hotel, while police vehicles occupied the fully-closed Tomlinson Road. A pair of Gurkhas stood guard by the road entering and leaving the hotel. The media scrum and police blockades meant passers-by had to tread a narrow path to get to the other side of the hotel, which is especially troublesome for those pushing strollers. But the obstructions didn't seem to bother one tourist from Melbourne. \"It's no inconvenience,\" said Mr Denis, who was visiting his daughter living in Singapore. \"The journalists were blocking a little bit, but that's their job.\" Journalists were also seen crowding the entrance to Treknology3, a bicycle shop on Tanglin Road. But sales assistant Jonathan said the effect has been positive. \"You have this, people will come down this way and discover the store,\" he said, adding that he has been seeing more walk-in customers. \"There's an increase in awareness that we are here.\" \"GOOD FOR SINGAPORE\" Attention also centred on the journalists themselves, with passers-by taking photos of the scene and one giggly group of teenage girls sneaking in shots of a handsome Caucasian correspondent. Retiree Mr Wu, 71, said he didn't mind the intense media attention as it put Singapore on the world map. \"There are a lot of international journalists here,\" he said. \"It's very grand, good for Singapore.\" The self-professed \"busybody\" said he waited outside the Shangri-La Hotel to catch a glimpse of Mr Trump's motorcade before heading over to St Regis. \"Is Kim coming out?\" he asked. \"I'd like to see the motorcades.\" Mr Wu said he had no issues with the tight security and road closures either. \"We were only stopped when the motorcade went out,\" he said. \"I even took a bus here.\" Then there was Mr Jun Miyagawa, who came from Japan to sell US and North Korea souvenirs outside St Regis. The 63-year-old Japanese, who arrived on Sunday and will stay for a week, was selling each country's flag for S$10 a piece and North Korea guidebooks and maps for S$15 each. Business was \"so-so\", he said. \"I came here to feel and study the historical summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un,\" he added. \"I guess the flags will be useful for tomorrow's event.\" Still, it was not long before plainclothes police officers caught up with Mr Miyagawa, in another example of the heightened security in the area. The officers checked his passport, flipped through his books and asked him questions about North Korea. Mr Miyagawa packed up his wares and left about 45 minutes later. Like Mr Miyagawa, the Australian tourist Mr Denis feels the summit will be significant. \"I hope for a really good outcome between the two of them,\" he said. \"It's better for all of us.\" Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

He was accompanied by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, according to a press statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  At the call, Mr Teo and Dr Mahathir \"reaffirmed the longstanding and extensive bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia\", MFA said.  They noted the frequent interactions between ministers and senior officials of both countries, and Mr Teo said both sides should continue to advance their bilateral ties on the basis of existing agreements, according to the statement.  In addition, the leaders exchanged views on regional and global developments and agreed that both countries should continue to cooperate to strengthen ASEAN and safeguard regional stability and development, MFA added. Dr Mahathir is in Tokyo on his first foreign trip since winning a shock election last month. He has since announced Malaysia's intention to cancel or review projects and deals agreed to by the previous government, including a high-speed rail project with Singapore. The new government is also reviewing a US$14 billion local rail line to be built by Chinese companies, and Dr Mahathir said on Monday that the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal should be renegotiated so smaller economies like Malaysia can compete against giants China and the United States. WORLD AT \"INFLEXION POINT\" Mr Teo is on a three-day visit to Tokyo since last Saturday to attend the conference.  He delivered the keynote speech in place of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was originally meant to address the conference but is staying in Singapore for the historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Kim Jong Un on Tuesday.  In his speech, Mr Teo said the world is at an \"inflexion point\".  \"Do we turn our backs on the openness and integration that has brought millions out of poverty and provided the promise of a better life? Or, do we strengthen our commitment to openness and integration, taking into account new realities, and find ways to make the necessary adjustments in the spirit of cooperation, collaboration and mutual respect?\" he asked. The Deputy Prime Minister said that it is important than for all countries to step forward and work together, to increase the openness and linkages among our economies.  \"In Singapore, Japan will find a reliable and steady partner for this journey,\" he added.  On the sidelines of the conference, Mr Teo exchanged greetings with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to a statement by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Monday.  The two \"reaffirmed the longstanding and strong ties between Singapore and Japan\", PMO said.  Mr Teo and Mr Heng also met Japan Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Taro Aso.  They discussed how Singapore and Japan can further strengthen and deepen their relations, and exchanged views on regional and global issues including how Singapore can contribute to Japan’s G20 Presidency in 2019, according to PMO.  In addition, Mr Teo and Mr Heng had lunch with members of the Japan-Singapore Parliamentary Friendship League and met former Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani. Aside from Dr Mahathir, Mr Teo and Mr Heng also called on Vietnam Permanent Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh, who was also participating in the conference.

I think at an emotional level, both of them want something significant out of this summit.\" But can the world trust Kim, that he is committed to denuclearisation and ending the Korean War? Dr Balakrishnan said: \"My sense of it is that there is a real desire for change. He said that he now wants to focus on economic development.  \"And having had the advantage of actually visiting Pyongyang, and actually seeing how much they have been able to achieve despite the legacy of the war and the sanctions, there is no doubt that the North Koreans are a determined, proud, enterprising, disciplined people.  \"And that is why I left with that sense, supposing they were allowed to participate as a normal country, open up to the world, access the technology through trade, there is so much that they could do. So I think that he is also working on that hope that this is a new phase, a new opportunity.\"  \"ENORMOUS STRATEGIC IMPACT\" Hosting the summit is set to cost around S$20 million, which Dr Balakrishnan described as an \"investment in world peace\". \"The big difference between them and us is that Southeast Asia, particularly for the original members of ASEAN, which you must remember, was formed in 1967 at the height of the Cold War and Vietnam War, is that we had peace, we had time to prove that economic openness, integration, globalisation, free trade, worked,\" he said.  \"In a sense, Singapore is the ultimate example of that paradigm. Now if you can secure peace and development in North Korea, and if you can dial down the tensions which have prevailed there for seven decades, it is going to have an enormous strategic impact.\" Dr Balakrishnan also confirmed that Singapore is footing the bill for Mr Kim's stay at the St Regis hotel.  \"Well, it’s hospitality that I would have provided for him anyway,\" Dr Balakrishnan said. \"And it’s all within the budget that the Prime Minister has specified, anyway.\" Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

While stocks wobbled and the dollar edged higher in initial reaction to the G7, which Societe Generale termed as a \"mess\", markets quickly recouped losses, with stocks firmer across the board on expectations that any withdrawal in policy stimulus would be very gradual on the backdrop of rising trade tensions. An MSCI index of European stocks  was up 0.7 percent in early trading, not far from a recent two-week high. The S&P 500 futures  were 0.1 percent lower after dropping as much as 0.3 percent in early trading, indicating a firm start for Wall Street. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  slipped early but was last up 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng  also gained 0.3 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index  fell 0.5 percent. The Fed is almost certain to raise rates again on Wednesday, inching closer to a neutral policy stance, while the ECB is likely to signal on Thursday that its 2.55 trillion euro bond purchase scheme will end this year, a key move in dismantling crisis-era stimulus. ITALY CONCERNS RECEDE Also helping risk appetite in early Monday trading were comments from Italy's new coalition government saying it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt levels. In his first interview since taking office a week ago, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria told the Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that the coalition was committed to remaining within the single currency and wanted to boost growth through investment and structural reforms. Bond yields tumbled by 25-50 basis points across the board in Italy while the euro firmed, nearing a recent three-week high. The single currency  was up 0.4 percent at US$1.1809 in early trading. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.1 percent lower at 93.470 . Oil prices slipped on rising Russian production and increasing U.S. drilling activity. Brent crude futures  fell 0.33 percent to US$76.21 a barrel and U.S. crude futures  slipped 0.3 percent to US$65.54 a barrel.

That’s the ideal transport vision for Singapore Goldbell CEO Arthur Chua painted when Channel NewsAsia spoke to him on Friday (Jun 8). Goldbell – traditionally a local small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) with decades of experience in leasing and distribution of commercial vehicles like lorries and trucks – is hoping to play an integral role in fulfilling the first- and last-mile parts of this transport system, Mr Chua said. The company was founded in 1980 by Mr Chua's father and grandfather and was the exclusive distributor for Komatsu forklift before it expanded into the distribution and leasing of other commercial and industrial vehicles. It also now has a financial services arm to help other businesses.  The 36-year-old Goldbell CEO is also co-founder of local start-up Ministry of Movement, and he shared that it has been working on an algorithm that dynamically matches bus shuttles with people who request for rides since 2016. “The idea is for one central command system to tell vehicles where to move,” he explained. These are buses that do not run on fixed routes, but will shift their routes according to demand, he added. There were just four people working on the algorithm at the start, and they had to cull publicly available datasets from avenues such as data.gov.sg to assess commuter movements and, from there, create a simulation engine to see if their idea would work. Once this was done, Ministry of Movement decided it was robust enough to launch a public, commercial service called Swat in August 2017 “with real buses, for paying passengers”, said Mr Chua. Commuters have the option of pre-booking Swat rides a day in advance or pre-booking on the same day but 30 minutes in advance, or for the last-minute passenger, request for one via its chatbot, according to its app store description. PENT-UP DEMAND “Day 1 was a bitter-sweet experience: We had 14,000 downloads (of the Swat app) and requests, but we were overwhelmed by the demand. We just couldn’t meet it,” the CEO recounted, adding the service is available today but in a trial setting. That said, the initial experience reinforced their suspicions that there is demand for the service they are offering, and it also caught the attention of the Transport Ministry as it wanted to know how this on-demand service would work here, he added. Another milestone was reached this February when Ministry of Movement was one of two companies awarded contracts worth more than S$466,000 to conduct the first phase trials for on-demand bus services. Mr Chua said it clinched the tender over more established players like Grab, which collaborated with the Government Technology Agency to launch its fixed-route on-demand GrabShuttle offering. Today, there are about 25 people working to finetune the Swat service as it prepares to launch the trial service in the fourth quarter of this year, and Mr Chua said it is working with SBS Transit on the operations side of things. This includes coming up with the driver training curriculum so that drivers would be able to adapt to real-time demand, changing their travel routes according to passengers’ requests. How drivers respond when they see multiple requests for last-minute insertions is one issue being looked at, Mr Chua elaborated. “We’re finetuning the driver experience to avoid such a situation,” he said, but declined to reveal more details as part of its agreement with the Land Transport Authority (LTA).   SELF-DRIVING IS THE FUTURE While Ministry of Movement is looking to get the drivers up to speed with this on-demand system, Mr Chua said the vision is ultimately for self-driving vehicles to take over. After all, a computer instructing another computer on where to go would be the most efficient way of directing traffic resources and would make the whole transport ecosystem less reliant on human labour, he explained. This is in line with the direction Singapore is heading. Mr Chris Leck, director of the Futures Division at Ministry of Transport, shared during a panel session at this week’s Innovfest Unbound that the manpower crunch will increasingly have an impact as many Singaporean bus drivers are in their fifties and above, and will soon leave the workforce. Goldbell, and by extension Ministry of Movement, is not standing still in advancing the development of such autonomous driving systems. In April this year, they signed a deal with China’s Haylion Technologies to build Futian Free Trade Zone into a demonstration area for an intelligent network and smart commuting. An on-demand bus service is expected to be rolled out by the end of this year, according to a report by Shenzhen Daily.     Singapore’s Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Apr 27 that he witnessed the signing of this collaboration, and shared a video of his experience riding the autonomous bus. Mr Chua pointed out that while technology is an enabler, it is not the key. “We think that the key is to bridge today’s technology with the actual conditions in a particular market (to effect change),” said the CEO. This, he said, is what will make the transport vision he described a reality in Singapore. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/how-a-traditional-sme-is-looking-to-drive-change-in-singapore-s-10408752"}, {"datetime": "11 Jun 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "Singapore summit"], "author": "Mubin Saadat", "title": "Trump-Kim summit: Singapore hosting a potential watershed moment in world history", "content": " SINGAPORE: A wavering possibility, rekindled by unexpected overtures, finally looks set for fruition. The highly anticipated tête-à-tête between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un on Tuesday (Jun 12) is on the brink of reality. For the first time, a sitting US President and a North Korean leader, representing two countries which have never seen eye to eye, will meet face to face, and the island nation of Singapore will host this historic event.  Just weeks ago, when Kim and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in took a stroll in the border village of Panmunjom, the sun shined again over the peninsula as the neighbours engaged like old friends. The world watched. When state leaders convene, even simple gestures – be it a hesitant handshake or an exuberant embrace – are scrutinised from every angle. Every uttered word is recorded as analysts and journalists dissect the discourse in the days and weeks that follow. And of course, the dining that goes with the diplomacy becomes the subject of media interest too. In summary, summits are significant. And the one Singapore is prepared to host ranks among the biggest that have altered the course of history. Even the recent Korean summit had a precedent just 18 years ago. But one between a US and North Korean leader has always remained an unlikely prospect since the Americans left the unfinished Korean War. More than half a century of pent-up anger, sanctions, sabre-rattling and diatribes between 11 US administrations and three successive North Korean leaders, have stalled nuclear disarmament talks and exacerbated tensions across the globe. This precarious backdrop sets the scene for this once unimaginable summit. And it’s precisely why there is a desperate optimism in some quarters for a watershed moment, even as questions remain as to whether hot button issues like the Korean War and denuclearisation will be addressed. Writing for The National Interest, Robert E Kelly, associate professor of international relations at Pusan National University, described the summit as \"one of America's strangest meeting\" where he expected very little and yet hoped for the best. \"Indeed at this point, it looks to be a nothing burger of photos and short, ‘get to know you’ meetings that yield nothing. But, again, if this meeting must happen, then let America should (sic) pull for Trump given just how important the stakes. Prove your critics wrong, Mr President,\" he said. TURNING POINTS While meetings between leaders are regular features of international relations, few can be perceived as significant turning points in human history. Hark back to the height of the Cold War, and you come across one of the most unexpected summits to have taken place in the last hundred years – the meeting between US President Richard Nixon and his Chinese counterpart Mao Zedong in Beijing. The balance of world power underwent a tectonic shift, as the leaders from opposite sides of the political spectrum shook hands and shocked the world in February 1972. US rapprochement with the Chinese dealt the Soviets a rude awakening in their quest for dominance in the bipolar conflict. While there were other factors that led to the eventual Soviet downfall, Nixon’s visit to China arguably precipitated the beginning of the end of the Cold War, opened China to the rest of the world and helped in the normalisation of its relations with its adversary, Japan. “For East Asia, the last most important summit was probably the Nixon-Mao summit that changed the course of the Cold War,” associate professor Bhubhindar Singh, a Northeast Asia expert from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Channel NewsAsia. The world would head in a different direction from that moment. Not long after that momentous occasion, still within the theatre of the Cold War, another memorable summit drew global attention. The famous Geneva fireside chat between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in November 1985 was another significant step towards ending the bitter conflict and the beginning of a temporary period of détente between the world powers. This meeting set the wheels in motion for subsequent summits between the two leaders, eventually paving the way for the end of the Cold War. Recent history has also recorded such unlikely get-togethers. The meeting between former US President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro just three years ago, was the first between an American and Cuban leader in half a century that quickly unlocked the doors to diplomatic ties. Later in the same year, the world turned its attention to Asia, and specifically Singapore. Shattering nearly seven-decades of tension, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou shook hands for almost a minute. Shifting in synchronised fashion from right to left for every camera flash to capture the historic moment, their smiles sustained throughout the handshake as a signal of solidarity. A watershed moment in cross-strait relations, said Chinese media, although hindsight might suggest otherwise. It was historic based on its symbolism, but not the impact it had on the future. That meeting, though, put Singapore under the global spotlight as host, bringing it valuable experience in the delicate task of accommodating leaders amid political sensitivities and security concerns that could have global ramifications.  What the island nation is about to handle over the next few days is, however, a different ball game altogether, not just because of the potential for a turning point of global magnitude. Putting the historical element aside, the Trump-Kim summit draws undue attention simply because of the leaders themselves. The protracted antagonism between Washington and Pyongyang is well-documented and has consistently manifested itself in the exchanges and statements under various administrations and leaders. But the language has never been more colourful and undiplomatic – “little rocketman”, “dotard” and “short and fat” come to mind - even as US allies, Japan and South Korea observed the tit for tat with bated breath. However, the tense state of affairs was suddenly assuaged, partly by an inexplicable exchange of cordial letters over the course of a week. Suddenly, the interaction took a more measured tone - perhaps even presidential as some have observed. For now, it seems all is well and good. HOSTS OF HISTORY Preparations have been underway at frenetic pace with officials from both sides conducting high-level meetings and communicating directly with their Singaporean hosts. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis were crystal clear in their appreciation of Singapore’s efforts in hosting the summit when they met their counterparts.    Singapore’s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said many officials have commented that without Singapore, preparations for the summit “would not have progressed so far”. It’s a testament to the country’s increasingly critical role in global politics. Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan was succinct in describing the hosts sentiment during a working trip to Washington earlier in the week. \"Happy to play (its) part for world peace,\" he said, as he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton. Just before welcoming the two leaders on Sunday, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted how this historic meeting gives the country publicity. \"The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting, we did not ask for it ... it says something about Singapore relations with the parties ... and our standing in the international community,\" he said.  When historic events take place, the cities that host them are entered into history as well.  The most famous capitals and even the most obscure towns become synonymous with epoch-making moments. The Versailles Treaty that ended World War I, the Potsdam conference of World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement that laid the foundation for the global economic system, and just two years ago, the historic Paris Climate Agreement – all among examples of significant turning points, named and remembered after their hosts. Singapore’s place among them should not be determined by the outcome of this summit, one could argue, as questions remain as to whether the meeting between Trump and Kim will be a watershed moment. “For Kim, this meeting is important for several reasons: To gain legitimacy for himself and his country. This meeting is also important for North Korea as it is in negotiation talks with the most important threat to its regime and national security,\" associate professor Bhubhindar Singh said. “For Trump, this meeting is to show his ability to ‘resolve’ the most difficult issue that other American administrations have failed to achieve. In more strategic terms, a deal here would reinforce America’s advantage and military presence in Northeast Asia vis-à-vis China.\" Some believe this could be just the start of a long drawn out process, especially in the sphere of denuclearisation. \"Kim is focused on the long game. If talks go forward after June, their differences over denuclearising Korea obviously won’t be resolved in a day,\" wrote Kent Harrington, a former CIA senior analyst, in a commentary. Will the summit mirror the impact of the Nixon-Mao meeting? Or will it begin a process of détente as did the famous fireside chat? Will it quickly open doors to diplomatic ties? Or simply be written as an inconsequential historic event, as was the Xi-Ma meeting? All we know for now is that the magnitude of what’s at stake cannot be overstated: The demands for North Korea’s denuclearisation, the possibility of ending the Korean War and normalising relations on the Korean Peninsula, and the impact of all this on the region and the rest of the world. The scheduled meeting between two eccentric world leaders, with the baggage of the past and present in tow, will draw all the attention from across the globe. Journalists and officials have already descended on the island in the thousands, casting a blinding spotlight on this tiny Southeast Asian country. According to associate professor Bhubhindar Singh: “The selection of Singapore says a lot of who Singapore is – an efficient, honest, neutral country that can be trusted to hold such an important summit.” Singapore – known for its efficiency, infrastructure and organisational competency – has to pull out all the stops for this one.  It’s a mammoth task to be executed within a tight schedule.

More than 2,500 journalists from around the world have descended on Singapore for the landmark summit, and some South Koreans are optimistic that the talks will bring about peace on the Korean Peninsula. The 1950-53 Korean conflict ceased with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving the two sides technically at war, and US President Trump said last week that it would be one of the issues that will be discussed at the historic summit.  A South Korean woman Channel NewsAsia spoke to said: “Of course, not everything could be resolved positively, but the fact that we are starting to see these changes from the North, I expect them to have a positive impact on the Korean Peninsula.” Some believe that Kim is sincere in his desire to reform North Korea. One South Korean said: “I used to regard Kim Jong Un as a person who only existed in the media, but now, it feels like he’s a real person who actually exists. I feel like I know him better now.” “I viewed him as a weird dictator, but it looks like he has the will to reform,” said another. Yet, there are others who remain sceptical that the meeting would bring about denuclearisation, or even result in peace on the Korean Peninsula. A South Korean woman said: “I am a bit scared, because this discussion around unification is progressing so quickly. The two Koreas are already so different from each other, and with the United States getting involved, now there are three different parties. It worries me a little.” One elderly South Korean quipped: “As far as I know, unification will never happen. Even if it does after the summit meeting, South Korean people will have to be the ones paying to feed those in North Korea. Is there anything good that can come from this?” His sentiments were echoed by another man who said: “South Korea used to give a lot of money to help North Korea, which was only used to develop so much nuclear weapons. South Korean people are feeling very anxious about the nuclear weapons of North Korea. So to be honest, I personally do not trust Kim Jong Un at all.” Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12). Subscribe to our channel here.

Trump landed at Paya Lebar Airbase on board Air Force One after cutting short his time at the G7 summit in Canada. He was received by Singapore's Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.  In a post on Twitter during his flight, Trump reiterated his optimism that the summit with the North Korean leader will be a success. “I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before … Create peace and great prosperity for his land. I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!” The US president had told reporters in Canada that he “felt confident” about Tuesday’s talks with Kim. \"It's unknown territory in the truest sense but I really feel confident,\" Trump said. \"I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity ... It's a one-time shot.\" \"I am on a mission of peace and we're going to be carrying the hearts of millions of people from all,\" he said. \"We have to get denuclearisation, we have to get something going.\" The meeting between Kim and Trump will mark a turnaround of relations between the two leaders after a long-running exchange of furious threats and insults. The summit, the first time a sitting US president meets a North Korean leader, was nearly called off just two weeks before the event. More than 2,500 journalists are in Singapore to cover the event. Kim is expected to stay at the St Regis hotel and Trump at the Shangri-La, both in the Tanglin area in downtown Singapore.

The phenomenon, which refers to the large-scale emigration of educated and high-skilled individuals from their birth country, also exists in OECD countries such as Spain, Ireland and Italy. Neither are Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore – prosperous economies with a GDP per capita of US$46,228, US$24,337 and US$57,722 respectively in 2017 – immune from brain drain. In particular, a high percentage of youths in these economies plan to seek greener pastures overseas, albeit for varying reasons. A 2016 survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) found that 57 per cent of young Hong Kong people aged 18 to 30 had the intention to emigrate, while another survey in Taiwan revealed that 62 per cent of Taiwanese between the age of 20 to 35 planned to seek employment abroad. Here at home, 42 per cent of young Singaporeans polled by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) in 2010 said that emigration was often on their minds, and 26 per cent were also actively exploring avenues to emigrate. What lies beneath the seeming disenchantment of youths in these Asian Tigers? Is this a cause for alarm for the governments of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore? PUSH AND PULL FACTORS  The IPS Survey of young Singaporeans showed that alongside social norms such as the positive perception of overseas relocation and the social status of overseas Singaporeans, a perceived lack of upward mobility in Singapore also fuelled the desire to emigrate. 89 per cent of respondents in the Taiwan survey cited low salaries as the key push factor for them to seek employment abroad. Fresh graduates in Taiwan are reportedly paid less than NT$30,000 (S$1,344) a month. A lacklustre job market at home, in contrast to the dynamic career opportunities in China, have also driven educated Taiwanese to relocate up north. Among the roughly 700,000 Taiwanese working outside of Taiwan in 2015, about 60 per cent or 420,000 were in China. Hong Kong’s notorious housing woes have propelled its young people to leave the overcrowded and land scarce city. However, harsh economic realities are not the sole reason for the disillusionment of young Hong Kong people. (READ: Hong Kong's brain drain: Why its young are losing hope and leaving) According to the CUHK survey, Hong Kong’s political malaise has an equally big part to play. 11 per cent of those who intended to relocate said they were unhappy with the government; another 10.3 per cent cited Hong Kong’s political and social cleavages as a push factor. While the youth in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore may face similar economic livelihood challenges, the emerging sense of angst in Hong Kong is different as it also stems partially from the city’s socio-cultural outlook under Chinese rule, especially the whittling away of a distinctive Hong Kong identity and culture. This dreary prospect of identity loss was presented by businessman and Chinese General Chamber of Commerce chairman Jonathan Choi, who recently said: \"In the future, we will no longer be Hong Kong people, but Greater Bay Area people,” as he urged Hong Kongers to focus on integration with China under the Greater Bay Area plan. In face of communist China's strong pressure on the city to assimilate, therefore, Hong Kong's youth are naturally anxious about the foreseeable fade-out of their identity and the paradox of living in their birthplace with a sense of rootlessness, or being strangers in their homeland.

BRAIN DRAIN IS NOT SIMPLY AN ECONOMIC ISSUE For all its negative connotations, brain drain may not necessarily be damaging to the sending country, at least in the economic sense. For one, the transnational movement of talents is not a one-way flow. This means the economic costs of brain drain may be compensated through government policy that encourages the inflow of high-skilled workers from other economies. Moreover, local talents who have relocated overseas may also return, where their overseas experience is a boon. The question is if the pull factors are compelling enough to lure these skilled workers back. Taiwan, with its vibrant democratic culture, is a magnet for young and aspiring Hong Kong emigrants – it is the most preferred destination for 16.3 per cent of Hong Kong youths. Taiwan’s challenge is to revitalise its flagging economy to create more attractive career opportunities for its youths. Economics aside, governments would be short-sighted to ignore the socio-cultural and political consequences of persistent talent flight over the longer term, particularly its impact on nation-building. Beijing clearly understands the implications and artfully plays the game to its advantage. Earlier in April, it unveiled 31 measures to make benefits and opportunities across the strait more accessible for Taiwanese firms and individuals. If the incentives successfully entice more Taiwanese to settle in China, Taiwan may become further divided as more people favour closer ties with Beijing. In Hong Kong, while a growing number of people are seeking to leave, 100 to 150 mainland Chinese stream into the city every day on One-Way Permits issued by mainland China. This population movement will probably transform Hong Kong society over the long term, giving rise to a people more open to influence from Beijing. Bolstering the Hong Kong identity to retain its young talent, however, is not an option for the Hong Kong administration, as it is likely to be construed by Beijing as a politically-incorrect move promoting “separatism”. In Singapore, where the outflow and inflow of migrants have become a norm, the Government has increasingly recognised the importance of building a national identity. On May 18, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah said in Parliament that the Singapore identity is “particularly pertinent” in the evolving global landscape, which is witnessing China’s rise, America’s “introspection,” economic shifts brought on by technology and so forth. She urged young Singaporeans “to help write the next chapter in the country’s history.” Nation-building is an ongoing process. For young nations like Singapore, the continuing consolidation of a national identity which fosters a strong sense of rootedness, may hold the key to drawing their overseas talent back home someday.

I lost four litres of blood, but my concern was whether the country would slide into a civil war,” says Jose Ramos-Horta as we talk about the attempt to assassinate him in 2008. In Singapore for UNLEASH, a global innovation conference aimed at coming up with solutions to achieve United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, he made some time to recount the most powerful moments of his fight for the freedom of Timor-Leste and tell me how he feels about his country’s future.  The 69-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate who served as foreign minister (2002-2006), prime minister (2006-2007) and president (2007-2012) tells of the decades he spent fighting for his country’s freedom from Indonesian occupation in a largely calm and collected manner with moments of subtle emotion as he speaks about the most painful and agonising events in his journey. Mr Ramos-Horta currently serves as an Adviser to the President of the UN General Assembly.  But memories of his past remain vivid in his mind. His country, Timor-Leste, previously known as East Timor had attained freedom from Indonesian occupation in 1999, but as a young democracy, it had its share of factional strife. To listen to the full interview, click here. The 2008 assassination attempt on Mr Ramos-Horta was perpetrated by a rebel soldier. “A renegade army officer, very unstable, with a huge ego went to the mountains, deserted from the army with about 20 followers. I wouldn’t use force against them. I was engaging them mainly through dialogue. Strangely enough, on that morning, he and his men came to my house while I was out doing my early morning exercises. There was an exchange of fire and he was shot dead by one of my security guards. I came back to the house and was shot. “The remaining renegade soldiers surrendered to me when I arrived back home after my recovery in hospital. They all surrendered with their weapons, but they were put on trial. After their trial, they were sent to prison, but I pardoned them.” He was criticised for doing so. I ask him why he felt compelled to do it. “Because these were soldiers, simple people. The turmoil had to do with the failure of their leader, not them. I wasn’t going to blame the small people.” He had, after all, spent most of his life fighting for the rights of his people, who he describes as the “little people” having to go up against much more powerful entities. His face might be weathered by years of diplomatic battle, but his eyes still bear the spark of the fiery freedom fighter who, for 24 years, lobbied the international community to restore justice and dignity to the people of Timor-Leste. POVERTY AND NEGLECT A former Portuguese colony, East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in December 1975 after the Portuguese left. Mr Ramos-Horta left his country just a few days before the invasion. As foreign minister in the Timorese nationalist leadership made up of pro-independence parties, he had been given a mission to plead the Timorese case before the UN. For the next 24 years of Indonesian occupation, he was the East Timorese resistance’s exiled spokesman. But he was no stranger to occupation, having grown up under the Portuguese, who had colonised East Timor four centuries previously.  His father was a Portuguese naval gunner who was himself exiled to the East Timor for a failed attempt to fight the dictatorship in Portugal. Mr Ramos-Horta was educated in a remote Catholic mission. He did well enough to become one of the few East Timorese to be sent to high school in the capital Dili. East Timor was largely a neglected trading post or the Portuguese. They hardly invested in infrastructure, health, and education. “During my time as a child, what affected me most was seeing the poverty, neglect, lack of education. There were very few schools and no university. This is what impacted me most. I wanted the Timorese to access education and to get more opportunities in life.\" Where Portuguese rule was actively asserted, it was “brutal and exploitative”, he says. Mr Ramos-Horta with other like-minded East Timorese yearned for freedom and when he made an indiscreet remark on the issue, he was exiled to Mozambique for three years. He returned to East Timor in 1974 Ramos-Horta and founded the Social Democratic Association of Timor which then became the popular pro-independence party, the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin). Following a coup in 1974, the new government of Portugal began a gradual decolonisation process. As part of a token gesture it held an election in East Timor in 1975. Fretilin garnered 55 per cent of the vote on election day but its power was challenged by a civil war believed to be initiated by a Jakarta-backed East Timorese political party, Apodeti. Amid all this and as the Portuguese withdrew, rumblings of an invasion began in Indonesia. It was believed that Indonesia was fearful of having a leftist state at its doorstep and also wanted to lay claim to the oil reserves which had been newly discovered in East Timor’s territorial waters. Even though East Timor declared independence in November 1975, it didn’t stop the Indonesian invasion just a month later. POWERLESS, HEARTBROKEN, ANGRY AND GUILTY Having been given the mission to lobby the international community to assist the Timorese in achieving full independence, Mr Ramos-Horta began an uphill task in the US. “Leaving my country was hard. I had to leave everyone behind.” This included his 11 siblings, three of whom were killed by the Indonesian military. “My sister was 21 years old at the time. She was killed during an air bombing on the village where she was. In 2003, after independence from Indonesia, we went to the place where she was killed. The local people saw and luckily, they buried her, so we were able to recover her body and buried it in the common cemetery in the capital, Dili.” Two of his brothers have still not been found. He believes they were killed and “like many thousands of Timorese” have been either buried in “unknown graves” or “just dumped in the bush”. The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor estimated the number of deaths from famine and violence during the occupation to be about 200,000 out of a population of approximately 800,000 in 1999. Not being in East Timor during the decades of atrocities, made him feel “powerless”. “I was absolutely heartbroken, angry and guilty that I wasn’t there, but that gave me a greater sense of obligation. Every time, any thought came into my mind about giving up, I thought of the common people whom I knew were suffering. I grew up in the mountains, in the villages and I received an order, a mission from the leader to go to the UN and defend our cause. I would be absolutely an abominable person if I betrayed all of that, so I kept on.” His mother was part of clandestine network that smuggled footage and photographic evidence of the atrocities, so he was well aware of the horror his people were going through. “I called members of the US Congress, called the UN Secretary-General, members of the UN, the media to make them aware of what was going on and so that I was relentless in that regard.” Financed in part by his the movement to free East Timor and non-governmental organisations, Mr Ramos-Horta lobbied the UN and prominent American leaders and non-governmental organisations. He also did some translation work to earn money. “But I had to live in cockroach-infested apartments. Sometimes, there wasn’t enough money for food. Today, whenever I go back to New York and I walk down the corridors, I always remember those traumatic experiences - the poverty, the difficulty, the loneliness, the indifference of governments.” Indeed, the indifference of the international community was a major hurdle. “If I were someone with a lack of faith, determination and a weak spirit, I would have given up because it was a general ignorance, lack of understanding, knowledge, basic information about my country.” STICKERS IN TOILETS The absence of digital media made the task of increasing awareness even harder. “It was next to impossible to educate people. All we had was conventional mainstream media and Timor-Leste is very remote from the rest of the world.” He had to exercise extreme ingenuity to get the word out. “In 1993, I went to the Second World Congress in Vienna, a human rights conference. There were thousands of people there. Non-governmental organisations and everybody had sophisticated posters of all sorts. I was all alone. An Australian, a former Jesuit priest and a friend arrived in Vienna with some stickers. They were small stickers which said, 'Boycott Bali, Free Xanana'. Xanana Gusmao, our independence hero, was in prison then. But such a small sticker, if you’d put it in the midst of all other posters will, it will be lost. “So I went to the toilets of the diplomats. I put the sticker right at the eye-level. So when the gentleman sits in there, inevitably he has to look at it and he’s alone there, so there would be no distraction from other posters,” he says with an almost gleeful laugh. I ask him if his efforts paid off. It was two days later that a reporter from the Wall Street Journal approached him to ask if he was the one responsible for the stickers. The Indonesian delegation had seen them and had protested to the organisers of the event. “At first I was like a kid caught doing something bad. I tried to deny it. But eventually, I admitted it because he wanted to do an innocent story about what I did and I got a chance to talk about the cause. So I was front-page news in the Wall Street Journal.” Ultimately, it was the Asian financial crisis and the downfall of President Suharto in Indonesia that catalysed international support for East Timorese independence. THE HYPOCRISY OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS In 1999, following a UN-sponsored act of self-determination, Indonesia relinquished control and East Timor became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century in 2002. It was renamed Timor-Leste, influenced by its Portuguese heritage. “But for that to benefit us, it didn’t happen just overnight. It took me 24 years of building networks of support particularly in Washington, in the US Congress. Even Portugal and the European Union played a critical role.\"  He managed to convince members of the US Congress to terminate military defence cooperation with Indonesia. \"The punitive measures worked,\" he says with satisfaction.  As he points out that during the occupation, many of his people were killed by American weapons, I ask him why he thinks it took so long for the international community to come on board. Immediately after the invasion, the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council passed resolutions condemning it and calling for Indonesia’s immediate withdrawal, but the US continued its cooperation with Indonesia. \"I still remember I arrived in New York in the winter of 1975. I had never seen snow in my life. I spoke at the UN Security Council and it passed a unanimous resolution demanding Indonesia to withdraw from Timor-Leste. That was my first lesson in international hypocrisy because the Americans, the French the British, they all voted on that resolution demanding Indonesian withdrawal, but Indonesia challenged it and continued to occupy East Timor. Not only that, the US kept selling weapons to Indonesia,\" he says with palpable frustration. He admits geo-politics played a huge role, but he eventually managed to find many members of the US Congress who “upheld principles of democracy and integrity” who were willing to “stand up” for his country. I remark that it’s unfortunate that it took 24 years for this to happen and only when Indonesia saw a leadership change. But he says he understands that sometimes the tide needs to change in larger ways for the administration to truly take notice. Today, he has many friends in the US Congress who continue to fight for the rights of the downtrodden including, in today’s context, of immigrants in the US who are being made to feel unwelcome by the current American administration. IS THE UN INEFFECTUAL? Considering his ties to the UN, I wonder how he would assess the body’s effectiveness, noting that even the resolution passed on his country was not enforced. He admits that the UN has been sidelined on many issues and has failed to take effective action in global conflicts.  “But the UN is made up of member states. It’s up to them how effective the body is. At this time, we are seeing a US administration that seems to be against multilateralism and others may be emasculating it because of rivalries, but eventually I believe we will all come back to the UN because there are no other solutions to the enormous challenges in every field that we face. Extraordinary complex situations require political will and the mobilisation of resources and because these problems are global, they can be tackled only through the collective political will of people and the collective mobilisation of resources and the UN is the only multilateral institution of this kind in existence.” Yet he was once quoted as saying that he supported the US’ unilateral action in Iraq. “I was totally misrepresented at the time. In fact, at that time I said that the West needs to give the UN time to try to find a way to resolve the standoff between the US and Saddam Hussein, but I did say that not every intervention is illegal or unacceptable, for instance in the case of the Rwandan genocide, I think the UN should have intervened in a timely manner and if they didn’t someone else should have. I had said that it depends on the situation. If someone were to intervene unilaterally to stop the genocide, would that be wrong?” GAINING REGIONAL STANDING Today, while Timor-Leste is a member of the UN, it isn’t yet a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “ASEAN countries have had reservations about our membership and those reservations are based on our preparation or capacity to observe the responsibilities as a member of ASEAN in adjusting, adopting laws, regulations such as immigration laws to conform with ASEAN standards. Security, trade, customs are all very, very important. For several years now, there has been a working group assisting Timor-Leste in its preparation to join ASEAN and this taskforce has been headed by Singapore, so we hope it will happen soon.” He has also taken a keen interest in ASEAN countries such as Myanmar and its Rohingya crisis. I ask him how he feels about ASEAN’s policy of non-interference considering our conversation about unilateralism and multilateralism earlier. \"I would say that ASEAN leaders are doing their best to help in any way they can and while they can’t help politically, there are other ways to help. I would encourage Aung San Suu Kyi to do more reach out to ASEAN countries to get advice on dealing with insurgencies, conflict prevention and mediation.” He believes that the international community has \"unrealistic\" expectations of her. \"Myanmar is transitioning from dictatorship and there is overwhelming distrust within the population. Aung San Suu Kyi is trying to handle an extremely delicate situation that she inherited and people expect her to pull out a magic wand and resolve all the problems. But educating the population and dialogue takes time.” DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION We turn to discussing current issues in his country which, just last month, had its second parliamentary election in less than a year with a coalition of parties led by Xanana Gusmao emerging victorious. While some reports have put a negative spin on the political state of the country, Mr Ramos-Horta feels otherwise. “The previous government was not able to function without an absolute majority, so we had another election. We let the people decide again and do so peacefully. It is a great testament to the consolidation of democracy. I’m happy that both elections went without any violence.” But according to some reports, the campaign was marred by violence. “Some journalists, because they get bored when nothing happens, even if an accident occurs, they’ll say it’s campaign-related violence. But there was zero violence of a political nature. I was in the country. There were strong emotional debates and accusations but that’s supposed to happen in a democracy. There was no violence and the results were certified by the election commission, consolidated by the Supreme Court and everybody accepted it. “We have had for 16 years now, peaceful constitutional change of government, no military coups, no takeover by anyone except through free democratic elections.” However, he apparently takes issue with the way the country has been run since he left office. In a previous interview, he had said that if he had been prime minister for 10 years, he would have focused all those 10 years on quality education, rural development and water sanitation for the people, something that the Timor-Leste governments so far have not done. “Yes, on the development side and economic side they have done less well. They have done massive investment in infrastructure, but while that’s needed, you can’t neglect other aspects. Failure in addressing the systemic problems of poverty and basic issues like clean water for communities is worrying. “This is a problem in many countries - fast growth, fast development that’s fueled by public expenditure, but that does not filter down to communities. But I believe the new government will also learn from past mistakes and change their approach.” Timor-Leste’s rich oil and gas reserves are also reportedly dwindling and some experts have warned that its economy will be severely affected. “We are familiar with these dramatic warnings from so-called experts that by 2022 current oil fields will be depleted, but we have invested our revenue over the years in a sovereign fund and we have liquidity. We have at least US$16 billion.” He also raises Timor-Leste’s recent treaty with Australia on their disputed maritime border and on a \"pathway\" to develop the giant Greater Sunrise offshore gas fields. The agreement places much of the Greater Sunrise fields under Timor-Leste’s control and that will “bring billions of dollars to the economy”. “But we still need to control public expenditure because the billions could run out fast,” he cautions. While the agreement with Australia has been welcomed, some non-governmental organisations have taken issue with the fact that it stipulates Australia will not compensate Timor-Leste for past exploitation of its oil fields. “Let’s put the past behind us. Australia also showed wisdom and statesmanship in backing down from past positions that they wouldn't negotiate with Timor Leste on a permanent maritime boundary. They have backed down, and they have contributed to our development in the last few years too, so we should back down too.” CEDING THE STAGE TO OTHERS Since leaving office in 2012, I wonder if he has ever thought of returning to politics in his country. “It’s time to cede the stage to others.” He says his assignments with the UN have kept him busy enough. Among his notable assignments were Chair of the High Level Independent Panel on UN Peace Operations tasked to reform the UN peacekeeping architecture and in 2013 and 2014 he served as UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Representative in Guinea-Bissau which was under a military regime. He brought the country through democratic elections. But his heart clearly lies in Timor-Leste. “I didn’t do everything well. Sometimes I made mistakes. Sometimes, in my fight for my country, I was rude to people, to some diplomats but they were more diplomatic than I am, so they were patient with me but I don’t recall having wasted or missed an opportunity that was available to me. I knocked on every door possible to bring my country to the attention of the world.” Today, he is also grateful that he didn’t die that fateful day in 2008. “I wanted to live to see my country independent and it is now a functioning sovereign democracy.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jose-ramos-horta-former-president-timor-leste-on-the-record-10407940"}, {"datetime": "10 Jun 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["national education", "education", "janil puthucheary", "schools"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Developing the Singapore story of the future", "content": " SINGAPORE: If you were in charge of admissions at a school with only one place to spare, which of these three students would you give it to? Would you give it to Alan, who consistently scores top marks despite often being caught sleeping in class, whose parents have spared no expense to give him the best tutors and enrichment classes, and who also happens to be a national swimmer? Would you give it to Mei Ling, a girl who does reasonably well in her studies, is passionate about dance, takes lessons at her local community club and helps train students in her school’s dance CCA? Or would you give it to Swee Wee, who works hard and consults her teachers at school frequently, but does not do well academically due to her struggles with the English language and her parents’ inability to afford private tutors? It is a question with no easy answers. But these Secondary 2 students at Swiss Cottage Secondary were trying their utmost to tackle it.  “National swimmers have more recognition than the president of a school CCA,” said a student. But another student countered, to laughter from the class: “What if he keeps losing?” “Mei Ling is the president of the school’s dance CCA,” piped up another student. “So she has leadership skills, and she helps the younger students. I think that’s more important than being a national swimmer.” The lively discussion took place during an hour-long, weekly class named Global Perspectives, which is part of the school’s Global Perspectives Programme. The programme hopes to teach students a plethora of skills, including critical thinking, exploring different points of view and ultimately, encourage them to suggest initiatives for social action. The topic of the day was meritocracy and social inequality. But other topics like racial differences, multiculturalism and immigration are also part of the curriculum.  Students also go for excursions or take up hands-on projects for the programme, which was first piloted in 2013 and integrated into the school’s curriculum for all lower secondary students. “Last year, we visited a migrant worker’s dorm,” said Secondary 2 student Aleena Lim. “Most people have the impression that they just slack off every day, but we saw their living conditions, and realised that their life is very tough.” “We learned how to take the perspective of the workers, and we understood how they would feel if other people were to criticise them.” REFRESHED APPROACH TO NATIONAL EDUCATION: MORE SCHOOL AUTONOMY IN SHAPING SUCH PROGRAMMES More school-driven initiatives like Swiss Cottage’s Global Perspectives Programme are likely to be on the cards for schools here, with the Ministry of Education’s announcement in March of a new, refreshed approach to National Education (NE). The refreshed approach, spearheaded following a year-long review by the 30-member NE Review Committee, features three key thrusts that schools are encouraged to frame their NE efforts around. For example, NE discussions will take on more contemporary issues, such as what students at Swiss Cottage are experiencing. And these discussions, explained Senior Minister of State for Education Janil Puthucheary in March, will also create safe spaces for students to have respectful conversations, whether they agree or disagree with each other and their teachers. Schools would also be given the autonomy to implement their own changes based on the profiles and needs of their students. And this means different interpretations of what constitutes NE could emerge, said NE Review Committee member and founder of The Thought Collective, Tong Yee. “Different people come from different walks of life, races, religions and background, and NE means something different for everyone,” he explained. “For example, there could be Christian values that might speak into what is meaningful for me as a citizen, and as a Buddhist, I might feel differently.” He stressed that the content – and core NE messages, such as the idea that no one owes Singapore a living – will remain the same. But schools will have the autonomy to make that message relevant to students of diverse background. “The sense of NE so far, is that it’s a very good historical tool,” added fellow committee member and executive director of social enterprise The Hidden Good Wu Jiezhen. “People learn about Sir Stamford Raffles landing in Singapore, how we ate tapioca during WWII, and how we overcame all the challenges we faced as a new nation.” But she said that the feedback from teachers, students and other stakeholders were that they did not just want to learn about the past, but also learn about contemporary issues and take ownership of how the new NE narrative is shaped. “When you teach the future, the future is not set, so you can’t teach a set curriculum,” she said. “That’s why one of the new thrusts is really about teaching the students about contemporary issues, to get them to think about how we are today, and how we can actively play a role in the Singapore that we want for the future.” “That’s a lot more active participation, rather than just passively receiving information.” MORE SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS ESSENTIAL IN SHIFT For this approach to work, both committee members said supporting teachers and giving them the skills to design and conduct such programmes is essential. Which, perhaps, would explain why the third thrust of the refreshed NE approach focuses on giving teachers more opportunities for professional development. “It’s not super easy to deal with contemporary issues,” explained Ms Wu. “So how can we equip teachers with the skill sets to facilitate conversations, rather than just delivering content?” Professional development and more support at the school level were also raised by teachers involved in developing the school’s Global Perspectives Programme at Swiss Cottage. The team, which includes staff members from various disciplines across the school, developed their materials and approach from scratch and tweaked it based on how students responded. Teachers involved in the programme hold regular professional development sessions, where they meet to address potential discussion points students might bring in, and talk about how they can tackle them. “Regardless of what subject you’re teaching, it’s useful, because you construct knowledge together as professionals,” said Mini Sathiya Sidhan, the teacher facilitating the lesson on meritocracy. “We also need to be very responsive to changes, because sometimes when someone prepares a lesson, it may not work in every class, and we sometimes get it changed on the day itself.” To that end, Mdm Sathiya noted, support from her colleagues in the school and professional development to help teachers develop soft skills like facilitating discussions on current affairs are extremely helpful. “When we offer students multiple perspectives on current affairs, we need to be aware of all the different perspectives, and also help students sift out the accuracy of the information,” said another teacher, Vicki Yong.   “We also had to bounce off a lot of different ideas about the various scenarios that could come up in class, what examples we should give, and how it should reflect different perspectives.” “So these professional development sessions are actually very critical to level up teachers’ knowledge on a certain issue.” EXCITING FIRST STEPS, BUT ONUS LIES ON STUDENTS TO TAKE CHARGE With schools being given the freedom to design and develop their own programmes, the sky’s the limit – and there are already several interesting ideas on the horizon, both committee members said. “I know one school that’s developing an entirely new CCA centred around Singapore,” said Mr Tong. “So you get badges and points ... and you become a better Singaporean.” “We always say that doing good doesn’t have to look a certain way, and I think that’s relevant to the new approach to NE,” added Ms Wu. “It’s for people to explore different versions of what it means to them.” “So you don’t have to volunteer at a beach clean-up if you want to support climate action,” she said. “It’s great if you do, but you don’t have to do that. You can come up with your own ideas ... like running an advocacy campaign in schools to get students to bring their own lunch boxes to reduce plastic waste.” But the true core of the shift, both committee members stressed, is seeing students take ownership and initiative of creating the NE curriculum of the future. “Some schools have very interesting ideas and programmes, so we really want more schools to also get on board,” said Ms Wu. “But the narrative really needs to come from the ground-up: from the students themselves.” “We all know that the next generation will be the ones running Singapore in the future,” added Mr Tong. “And it’s not about us entertaining them so they have a good experience with NE.” “It’s more about developing the skills in the students now, so they become civic leaders, and start coming up with their own ideas.” While he pointed out that there is “a lot of work to be done” and it could take at least five to 10 years before seeing this really bear fruit in the students, Mr Tong said he has high hopes for schools and students. \"Schools used to engage us to run trails in the community to grow in community understanding,\" he explained. \"But some schools are now asking for training to design trails, or ask their students lead the trail themselves.\" “So they want student development, and skill-set building, which is really the right focus,” he said. “So by doing this, it's going to make more schools have this shift, or accelerate the shift. “I have hope for them.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/developing-the-singapore-story-of-the-future-10369508"}, {"datetime": "10 Jun 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["Hyflux"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "'A big shock’: Retail investors in Singapore caught out by Hyflux woes", "content": " SINGAPORE: Seen as one of Singapore’s most successful business stories, water treatment specialist Hyflux’s recent woes had come as a shock for many and for Mrs Goh, it was something that she had not seen coming.  Lured by an attractive 6 per cent coupon, she had put in S$10,000 into the company’s preference shares issued in 2011 at S$100 apiece. While there was news about Hyflux’s weakened financial position over the years, semi-annual distribution payments have remained prompt, said the retail investor in her 60s who preferred not to reveal her full name. “I didn’t expect it to be that bad and they would need to do debt restructuring,” she told Channel NewsAsia. “The announcement was a big shock.”  Citing “short-term liquidity constraints” after being hit hard by “prolonged weakness” in the local power market, mainboard-listed Hyflux on May 22 applied to the High Court to begin a reorganisation of its debt and businesses.  Its shares and related securities have been halted from trading since May 21 and this has caught many mom-and-pop investors, like Mrs Goh, off guard, said market analysts.  “There was an element of surprise because even at the results briefing in February, the company still gave an impression that they can pull through this,” said KGI Securities analyst Joel Ng.  Then, CEO and chairman Olivia Lum had stressed that Hyflux would not be cornered into a “fire sale” for its loss-making assets, even as the company announced its first annual loss since listing in 2001 and that it would be deferring the redemption of its S$400 million tranche of preference shares.  Separate discussions with “several potential investors” to inject additional funds for the group's growth activities were also underway, the firm added in the earnings announcement. “They seemed confident so I think that’s what caught most investors off guard,” said Mr Ng. LEFT HANGING Experts have said that the court protection against creditors’ claims would buy Hyflux much-needed time to sort out its financial woes. One of which would be to dispose of its underperforming assets, such as the Tuaspring project which has been an impediment to earnings since the power plant operations began in March 2016.  Describing the integrated water desalination and power plant as “the elephant in the room”, OCBC’s credit analyst Ezien Hoo foresees a “good chance” for Tuaspring to be sold as “the water portion of the plant is highly strategic”.  But uncertainties over timing and pricing remain due to a challenging market landscape, she added.  Still, a huge asset sale would definitely “loosen the noose around Hyflux’s neck” and in turn, retail investors who have been left reeling amid the uncertainty, said investment specialist S. Nallakaruppan.  These include ordinary shareholders, who are at the bottom of the priority list in a liquidation scenario, as well as holders of Hyflux’s preference shares and perpetual securities.  In particular, the latter make up a “significant and vulnerable” lot, said Mr Nallakaruppan, who sits on the executive committee of The Society of Remisiers (Singapore) as its honorary treasurer. This is because such bond-like instruments have no maturity date and while sold with a call date, a non-call or non-payment of distribution do not constitute defaults.  Apart from the S$400 million worth of 6 per cent preference shares that Hyflux has said it would not be redeeming, causing a step-up in the coupon to 8 per cent, the firm has another tranche of 6 per cent perpetual securities worth S$500 million. This was issued in 2016 and in its announcement last month, Hyflux had said that it would not be making the coupon payment due at the end of May.   Both tranches saw strong demand when they were issued, attracting yield-hunting retail investors who subscribed through ATMs. Mr Nallakaruppan said he knew of investors who had put in S$200,000 or more, with retirees among them.  “Interests rates at the banks were just far too low and because of that, a lot of the investors were hunting for yields,” he said. “They also see Hyflux as a growth company dealing with an important resource.”  But now, they “can only hope for the best”, added Mr Nallakaruppan.  “There’s no covenant for these investors to bring an action against the company unfortunately.”  Amid the uncertainty, analysts said it may be too early to speculate over potential restructuring terms but retail investors may have to brace for some losses.  Citing how both perpetuals were trading at a discount before the suspension, Mr Ng from KGI Securities said: “Markets were already pricing in that they have to take a haircut.”  WAIT IT OUT? Mr Nandakumar Renganathan, a partner to RHTLaw Taylor Wessing’s litigation and dispute resolution practice, suggested retail investors to first “wait out” the 30-day moratorium – which kicked in automatically from the date of Hyflux’s application to court.  The court hearing scheduled for Jun 19 will likely provide more clarity on the company’s plans, he added. By then, individual investors can also band together as a group and be pro-active in engaging Hyflux.  “From how I look at it, the best way for investors to move forward is to first wait out the moratorium period,” said Mr Renganathan. “Then, it will be good for them to engage those undertaking the restructuring process as a group to get more information and see how they can have their rights protected as part of that reorganisation. That may give them better results.”  “From the retail investor perspective, if the restructuring can be done in a way that allows the company to raise more capital and continue to develop and grow, that would be the best result because that would mean that the company would still be able to honour its commitments,” he added.  The Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) said in a media statement last month that Hyflux is “agreeable” to meetings with its shareholders, noteholders, perpetual securities holders and preference shareholders. These will be organised “in due course”.  Noting that retail investors are not on the same footing as institutional investors, SIAS President David Gerald said the advocacy group “reiterated its call to accord equal treatment to the perpetual and preferential securities investors” and “would like to see every effort made to find ways of preserving the value” of these investments.  But he also called on retail investors to extend Hyflux time for its reorganisation.  \"(The) company is doing its best, given the circumstances, to maintain value (for their retail investors) but they do need time to achieve this outcome,” the statement said.  For now, Mrs Goh can’t help but worry that she may not be able to get her money back. “Hyflux has the moral right to make sure that all retail investors are protected,” she said.  Having also invested in beleaguered commodities trade Noble Group and suffered a steep loss, recent troubles at Hyflux have further dampened her risk appetite and confidence in the local market.   “I’ll just wait and see. What else can I do?\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/a-big-shock-retail-investors-in-singapore-caught-out-by-hyflux-10407930"}, {"datetime": "10 Jun 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["Ramadan", "migrant workers", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Ray Yeh", "title": "'We need to take the first step': Giving migrant workers a taste of home away from home this Ramadan", "content": " SINGAPORE: It was a Sunday of many firsts for Kadir Mohammad Abdul, Hosen Sahadat, Islam Shohidul and Abul Hosen. It was their first time inside a Housing Development Board home - though they’d certainly helped build enough of these flats over the years. Their first evening as guests of a Singaporean family. Their first taste of a real Singaporean home-cooked meal.  On their sole day off after a draining week of 12-hour work days while fasting, the four men from Bangladesh had spent some time at their dormitory in Mandai dressing up for the occasion. Kadir, the ‘elder brother’ of the group, sported a striped shirt, Sahadat and Shohidul donned punjabi suits, while Abul, the youngest, filled out a shirt and vest. They were upbeat if a tad nervous as the hour of iftar - the breaking of the fast during Ramadan - drew closer. When asked, Kadir brushed it off with a laugh and the Singlish-ism he’d picked up after six years in Singapore. “No lah, scared for what?” he said, as they navigated the confusing layout of the HDB block's circular void deck, trying to find the way up to the third-storey unit. “Happy lah, our first time here.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Waiting for them were their Singaporean hosts, Siti Zawiyah, a nurse in her late 30s, and her husband, interior designer Fadzullah Hassan. When Siti learnt that a friend who works at CNA Insider was documenting the lives of migrant workers this Ramadan, she thought this would be a good opportunity to “take that first step” to invite them to dinner - a gesture of appreciation for what they’d done for Singapore, as well as sympathy for the fact that they were thousands of miles from home during this time. (Read Part 1: 'My heart cries': Muslim migrant workers ache for family, but find support from bosses) Over the years, Siti and Fadzullah have shared trays of food with migrant workers while breaking fast at the mosque during Ramadan. We’ve been wanting to invite them over, but we just didn’t know how to approach someone and say, ‘Oh, do you want to come to our house?’ And so, Siti asked her parents if they could host the four Bangladeshis at their five-room flat, the roomy venue for countless family gatherings. “It was an instant yes, no apprehension whatsoever.” In fact Madam Sukati Mustaffa, a homemaker in her mid-60s, asked if more of their fellow workers could come. Their enthusiasm, Siti reckons, springs her father’s time as a drydock fitter at Keppel Shipyard, where he worked for four decades alongside migrant workers. The family had grown accustomed to hearing Mr Mohamad Lamin talk affectionately about his colleagues from Bangladesh, Myanmar and India.  “He understands how they have been away from family, so it’s always been in his nature to bring food from home for them,” said Siti. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n HAPPINESS AND TEARS For iftar with their special guests that night, Mdm Sukati had prepared well-loved family dishes such as sambal prawns, pan-fried mackerel fillets, stir-fried vegetables and chicken curry. Siti’s younger sister and brother-in-law also came over with their young children. At 6.30pm, Kadir and his friends showed up at the door. They greeted the adults shyly, but were almost immediately drawn to the children - Myiesha, a smiley six-year-old, and playful toddler Mateen. Abul, 26, seemed to have a natural affinity for them, while the children seemed to touch something deep in Kadir. “Now, I'm seeing this, I'm missing...” said the older man, unable to finish as emotion took hold.  This is the sixth consecutive Ramadan that the father of three has spent away from his family. Kadir has had to watch his children - aged six, eight and ten - grow up through video calls and photos. Earlier that day, he’d tried to make his usual Sunday call to them, but the connection had failed, and the homesick longing was clear on this face. WATCH: Trying to make a home away from home (7:31)  Siti's family was curious about their Bengali visitors, but didn't want to to unnerve them by being too forward with questions.  “It took a while for them to warm up. But my father helped a lot by sitting with and talking to them,” Siti said. Her husband, Fadzullah, gave a short heartfelt speech thanking them for the sacrifices they made to work here and build Singapore.  A beaming Kadir expressed how he was “very very happy” to be invited - and abruptly broke down into heaving sobs, the pain of being away from his own family crashing down hard on him. “Don't cry. You will meet your family,” said Mr Mohamad, trying to comfort him. 'HAVE WE EXCLUDED THEM?' Siti understands only too well what migrant workers like Kadir go through, especially the loneliness. “Despite being with friends in the dorm, ultimately that’s work, and it’s sad not to have family relations,” she said. “Relying on mobile phones, how happy can they really be?”  In 2015, soon after she and Fadzullah got married, the couple organised a small backpack-and-toiletries donation drive for migrant workers. The idea came about when Siti spotted a worker on the train with a dirty, tattered bag. “My niece had a nicer bag,” she thought. The couple collected more than 100 backpacks filled with hygiene essentials. But when they tried to hand these out for free to workers near construction sites, “they were quite apprehensive,” said Siti. It was as if they felt they didn’t deserve any goodness from us. The couple then contacted advocacy group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), which among other things, runs a free food programme for destitute workers in Little India. Being there and handing out the remaining backpacks “was an eye-opening experience”, Siti said. They met migrant workers who could no longer work due to injuries, but had no savings to return home “so they were pretty much in limbo”. Some of these workers could not believe that they could keep the bags for free. “‘Do I have to do something?’ they would ask me. I’d say, ‘No, no, it’s yours to keep.’ “That was when I asked myself why they would react this way. What does it say about us? Have we always excluded them?” added Siti. Nicholas Harrigan, a university lecturer who volunteers as one of TWC2’s research coordinators, said that “despite adversity, overall these men are resourceful and proud”. But, “they are away from home, they work long hours for low pay, and they’re often in considerable debt,” he noted. “All of these can contribute to poor mental health. But job insecurity, agent fee debt and verbal harassment by supervisors are the most damaging.” So “while social integration would be nice,” Mr Harrigan said, “honestly, it is a long way down the list of priority issues migrant workers would like resolved”.  GIVING BACK, BEYOND RAMADAN Still, knowing that someone cares could go some way towards helping them bear that burden.  Fadzullah believes that coming to Singapore “is a gamble” for many migrant workers. “If it’s good, they earn money and rejoin their families. But if they fall sick or get injured, they lose everything. No money, no future for them or their families.” That is why he and Siti hope that more Singaporeans would “play a part by giving back” to these men - and not just during Ramadan, when the spirit of giving runs high. “For most of us who work, we have enough and there is always something we can give - not in terms of money all the time, but in terms of time and effort also,” Siti said. And giving back is just what dozens of CNA Insider viewers have volunteered to do, in a moving response to Part 1 of this story describing the life of Muslim migrant workers during Ramadan. Many on Facebook said they would be happy to host migrant workers to a meal at home - and starting Sunday (June 10) night, several will get to do just that, in house calls facilitated initially by CNA Insider.  Reflecting on his first experience as a guest in a local home, Kadir said that while he was a bit nervous at first, the family was very friendly. “The culture is actually very similar to my family. Together we sit on the floor, share makan, and after praying we have tea and talk… I miss this. It makes me very happy,” said Kadir, who is planning a one-week trip back to Bangladesh during Hari Raya Haji in August. Said Fadzullah: “We as Singaporeans need to take the first step. I’m glad that we did today, and inshaa'Allah (god willing), we’ll do it again.” If you would like to host a small group of migrant workers to a meal at home, contact us on Facebook.

Trump, who last week slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico, left the Group of Seven summit early but not before threatening to cut off trade with countries that treated the United States unfairly. \"We're like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing,\" he said at a press conference as his G7 counterparts continued their two-day meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, and officials hammered out a joint communique. \"This isn’t just G7. I mean, we have India, where some of the tariffs are 100 percent ... And we charge nothing,\" Trump said. \"And it's going to stop. Or we'll stop trading with them.\" In their communique, the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan agreed on the need for \"free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade\" and the importance of fighting protectionism. \"We strive to reduce tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers and subsidies,\" they said in the statement. Trump, who repeated that his tariffs are meant to protect U.S. industry and workers from unfair international competition, told reporters he had suggested to the other G7 leaders that all trade barriers, including tariffs and subsidies, be eliminated. He also denied the summit had been contentious, a remark that contradicted what one G7 official described as an \"extraordinary\" exchange on Friday in which Trump repeated a list of trade grievances, mainly concerning the EU and Canada. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the official's remarks about Trump. Trump's counterparts in the G7 have been scrambling this week to try to find some semblance of consensus with Washington on trade and the other key issues that have formed the basis of the 42-year-old organization. \"These are jointly shared principles, although the pitfalls lie in the details,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a press conference before the release of the communique. French President Emmanuel Macron described it as a good first step that represented the G7 nations' desire to stabilize the situation. \"Nevertheless, I do not consider that with a declaration all is obtained and it is obvious that we will have in the coming weeks, the next months, to continue to work,\" Macron told reporters.

Dr Balakrishnan was invited to the country by his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho after a working visit to Washington on Tuesday, where he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton. He was in Pyongyang from Thursday to Saturday morning. In Pyongyang, he witnessed a clean and beautiful city with ongoing construction for modern commercial and residential buildings. He also saw an eye hospital with the latest medical equipment, he told reporters. “To be frank with you, I come back very impressed,” Dr Balakrishnan said to Singapore media on Saturday in Beijing, where he made a brief stopover after flying from Pyongyang in the morning.“Frankly, my views have also altered based on what I saw, heard, and (after I had) spoken to people,” he said, sharing his reflections on North Korea. “Clearly, the government has been hard at work all these decades to upgrade their infrastructure.\"  Dr Balakrishnan also said he saw beyond the hardware in North Korea.  “I also got to experience the rugged, disciplined, determined, self-reliant society,” he said. “They know they have had enormous challenges for well-nigh a century in North Korea. But they are proud of themselves and of their identity, and I can see there is that determination to move on, get ahead and to progress.\"  “So the society itself is a very impressive society and a city in its own right,” he added.  “Despite these maximal sanctions, what you have is a society that has continued to invest itself and continuously trying to upgrade people and their skills and the services they provide to their citizens,” Dr Balakrishnan said. “Now, can you imagine if peace finally comes, and North Korea is allowed to open up to the world and gain access to technology, capability, skills and markets.\" “I think the sky is the limit for their people,\" he added.  And while Singapore is a neutral host, it’s hoping that a breakthrough can be made on its grounds on Jun 12, the foreign minister said. \"If a breakthrough is achieved during the summit in Singapore, if peace comes, there will be a bountiful harvest.  “Primarily of course, with the Korean peninsula but also the rest of us, including Singapore as well.”  Dr Balakrishnan had previously made tongue-in-cheek remarks about how Singapore would just be serving coffee and tea to its guests during the Trump-Kim talks. But on a serious note, he said Singapore has been working very hard to ensure it provides negotiating parties a safe and secure environment for the talks. “If you knew how much work my staff in the ministry have worked: They’ve all had sleepless nights answering messages from all over the world, addressing very specific requests – it goes far beyond serving coffee and tea,” he said.  Dr Balakrishnan also said Singapore’s role in contributing to world peace and in improving bilateral ties between the US and North Korea is a worthy cause.  He also shared in a Facebook post on Saturday that he visited Mangyongdae, a traditional rural house commemorated in North Korea as the birthplace of its founding president Kim Il Sung.  He also visited the Korean Revolution Museum, Juche Tower and rode the Pyongyang Metro, which was built in the 1960s, he wrote.

And according to marketing and hospitality experts Channel NewsAsia spoke to, the summit is a priceless opportunity for Singapore to showcase itself to the world. Preparations are well underway for Tuesday’s summit, which will be held at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island, and in the lead-up, images of Singapore have been splashed across the front pages of newspapers and television broadcasts around the world. This, said founder of marketing consultancy Kepios Simon Kemp, can help raise valuable awareness about what the country can offer. “When I go travelling around the world, I find that a lot of people know that we exist, but they have no idea where we are on the map, and have no idea that we’re not part of China,” said Mr Kemp. “They have no idea how clean it is, how vibrant the city is...and once they do…I don’t think anything more than simple awareness is needed for people to add Singapore to their list of destinations.” “The Formula 1 race has done a wonderful job in projecting Singapore’s landscape, image, and beautiful skyline on a global scale, and the upcoming summit will do the same,” added Lars Voedisch, managing director of PRecious Communications. “This is something that a lot of countries would pay a lot of money for.” And when the throng of international media land in Singapore, they will experience, according to managing director of public relations firm Asia PR Werkz Cho Pei Lin, what she terms the “Singapore DNA”. “From welcoming them at Changi Airport, to our garden city, connected infrastructure and transport network, a SMART Nation, clean and efficient, and the ability to put together the summit at short notice whilst ensuring safety and security for the two delegations and Singaporeans,” she said. “It is an opportunity like never before to showcase Singapore to the world.” “As a Singaporean, I’m very proud that we are trusted by the United States and DPRK to put this together on such short notice,” she added. BENEFITS TO SINGAPORE GO BEYOND TOURISM DOLLAR Citing high-level meetings Singapore has hosted in the past, such as the Shangri-La Dialogue and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, Mr Voedisch added that the summit will reinforce Singapore’s reputation for being a go-to destination for such meetings. This, he said, could also have benefits in attracting more foreign companies to set up shop in Singapore. “If everything goes as planned, it will re-emphasise the image that Singapore is one of the safest places on Earth,” he said. “Which company, CEO or family wouldn’t want that for their families and staff?” “The fact that both the President of the US and the North Korean leaders have chosen Singapore also shows that it’s easily accessible,” he added. “If you think about why Singapore attracts so many global and regional HQs, it’s because the CEOs and decision-makers feel that it’s not only a good place for them, but safe and enjoyable for their families.” “So it adds to the image that Singapore can not just attract tourists, but also the best of the international workforce.” Mr Kemp noted that the summit would also position Singapore as having a “relatively inclusive” culture and society. “It’s really interesting that two countries that are, perhaps, at complete opposite ends of the spectrum around the world have chosen Singapore as the place where they both feel comfortable,” he said. “I think that says a lot about what Singapore means to political leaders around the world.” Mr Voedisch added that from a political standpoint, Singapore’s reputation as a “neutral and trustworthy” player on the international stage will also be enhanced. “Singapore can also play up the image of a positive peacemaker,” he said. “That’s an added value that can come out of that.” BENEFITS EXTEND TO SENTOSA, HOTELS AS WELL The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) noted that as with all high-profile visits, the Trump-Kim summit “places Singapore on the map for international audiences”, and “showcases Singapore as an ideal destination, especially for businesses and meetings.” And experts pointed out that this will benefit Sentosa in particular, which has largely been perceived and marketed largely as a tourist and leisure destination. “Sentosa is a tropical island off a tropical island,” said Mr Voedisch. “So in terms of the images, you have the greenery, landscape, and maritime shots that add to the flavour of what it’s known for.” “But it’s mainly known for being an entertainment and holiday destination for families, so the summit will help Sentosa to position itself as a great place to hold meetings and events.” “From a security perspective, you can see why Sentosa is attractive for such meetings,” added Mr Kemp. “It’s much easier to manage a small place, and you could very easily cordon off the whole island. “Besides that, the idea that there’s a very serious political conversation going to take place there also gives Sentosa the opportunity to show off a whole new element to its image.” And while hotels involved in the summit – whether host hotel Capella, or the hotels the foreign delegations will be staying at – will undoubtedly have their work cut out for them, hospitality experts noted that they will experience “priceless benefits”. “If you are good enough for the President of the United States, then you’re good enough for anyone,” said Kevin Wee, a senior lecturer in hospitality and tourism management at Nanyang Polytechnic. “Let’s say security-conscious billionaires want to book entire floors for their entourage,” he explained. “They might say that if Capella or Shangri-La have met the President’s needs, they should be able to meet your needs.” “This sort of branding is priceless, which is probably why they’re happy to go through all the work.” “Imagine the President is making a speech at the podium, and it has your hotel name and logo, and the façade of your hotel is on all the news broadcasts around the world,” added Revi Nair, a senior lecturer in hospitality and tourism management from Temasek Polytechnic. “The value of that kind of publicity can’t be measured.” The opportunity of hosting such an event also gives hotels the chance to put their culinary and banqueting skills on full display, added Mr Nair. “From choosing the local produce on the menu, to decorating the tables with subtle hints like an orchid here, or a Merlion there...hotels would not pass up the chance to showcase Singapore and their hotel.” Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

Specks of sediment swirl around you and the visibility ranges from less than 1m on a bad day, to perhaps 5m on an exceptionally good day.  This particular Saturday (Jun 2), there was a downpour in the morning and we felt lucky we could see beyond our outstretched hands in the murky depths. Twenty volunteer divers, myself included, had sailed southwest from Singapore out to Raffles Lighthouse on Pulau Satumu for an underwater cleanup and marine BioBlitz organised in conjunction with World Oceans Day, which falls on Jun 8. The first dive involved hunting for trash; the second, for marine life, which we were to document with our cameras for experts at the National Parks Board (NParks) and community group Friends of Marine Park to sieve through, and add to NParks’ database on marine biodiversity. Since the beginning of the year, there have been a number of such events organised in Singapore waters. This particular dive trip, organised by the Marine and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), was a little different as Raffles Lighthouse is normally a restricted area. Other than marine biologists, who conduct their field research here, few dive at this southernmost islet in Singapore waters. Marine biologist Neo Mei Lin, who has dived extensively in Singapore for her work, told Channel NewsAsia it was her favourite local dive site, as it has a plethora of coral. \"It is also home to numerous marine life such as a nurse shark, pink dolphins and giant clams!” she said. But for our first dive on Saturday, we were looking for rubbish, not sea creatures. Armed with mesh bags, baskets, shears and gloves, four groups of divers scoured the reef for things that should not be there. We picked up about 110kg of trash, comprising plastics, netting, fishing lures, ropes and more. Mr Jeremy Seaward, a regular volunteer at MPA’s marine conservation programmes, said: “The trash that we found were mainly nylon ropes, glass bottles and fishing lines. We also saw some interesting marine life that we don’t usually see elsewhere in Singapore waters.\" On the second dive, we looked for fish, sea slugs, coral, sponges and crustaceans, among other marine life. The purpose was to log as many species as possible to aid scientists in their scientific surveys. The trick, in such low visibility, was to go slow. Then steadily, as we got used to the dimness, the reef gave up its wealth of sea creatures to our searching eyes.  A school of yellow-tailed fusiliers zipped around us as we finned, shy angelfish and damselfish darted into holes when we got close, a large grouper glared with baleful eyes from under a coral overhang and clownfish squirmed in their anemone homes. Look even closer and you will see the colourful nudibranchs (or sea slugs), slender pipefish, translucent clingfish, pygmy cuttlefish and, at times, the wary eyes of an octopus peeking out from its hideout like periscopes. MORE CLEANUPS IN LOCAL WATERS A series of marine cleanups and BioBlitzes were started this year, the International Year of the Reef, with the aim of spreading awareness about biodiversity in Singapore waters and conservation of the environment. MPA is organising multiple marine cleanups this year, to collect trash underwater and to pick up surface flotsam from kayaks. The BioBlitzes organised by NParks were also started this year. NParks has also rolled out a new citizen science programme called Beach Patrol where volunteers help look out for certain species along Singapore’s shores, such as sea turtles and their nests, and horseshoe crabs. For some of their cleanups, MPA works with community group Our Singapore Reefs, which organised Singapore's first community-led underwater cleanup effort in July last year.  Started by marine biologists Sam Shu Qin and Toh Tai Chong, it now works with various partners to run regular cleanups and conservation activities. It has also gathered volunteers to clean up the reefs at the Sisters' Island Marine Park on Sunday. Besides these efforts, a community group started by Mr Lim Teck Koon, 31, also holds monthly marine and beach cleanups at Lazarus Island, where they have picked up between 100kg and 200kg of trash each time. Mr Lim started the group, named Small Change, in April 2017 and organised their first cleanup last October. Boat owners have lent their vessels to the group at no cost. “We pick up lots of plastic cups which are likely from the party boats. The beach clean-up team usually picks up lots of plastic bags and food packaging,” he said. THE UNDERWATER TREASURE HUNTERS Underwater photography enthusiasts have also been actively promoting local dive sites such as the reefs at Pulau Hantu, right by the oil refineries of Pulau Bukom. Mr Kelvin Pung, 40, started the Sg Underwater Macro Photographers Facebook group in 2016 along with Dr An Ng, a former Hantu regular. Mr Pung started diving in Indonesian waters but is now hooked on local diving. “I dived into Hantu without expectation, but I saw so many nudibranchs I had never seen in my first two years of diving,\" he said. While there are no manta rays and a turtle sighting is rare and momentous, there are many tiny gems in local waters, in particular, a large variety of luridly-decorated nudibranchs, which are manna to the underwater photographers. “Our shores are under-appreciated. Our goal is to discover more new species and photograph them then show it to everyone, create awareness for local diving,” Mr Pung, who is also a para-badminton coach, said. He hopes that this increased awareness will boost the local scuba diving industry and preserve Pulau Hantu from future reclamation. Many regulars sign up for trips via another Facebook group, the quirkily named Weird Divers@Singapore. There are now about 100 active divers in the group, according to Mr Pung. Their effort to dispel the notion that there's \"nothing to see\" in Singapore waters appears to be gaining some traction. According to Mr Francis Yeo, who has been running dive operations in Singapore for 25 years, there has been a small surge in interest recently.  He was pleasantly surprised to have dozens of new divers signing up for local dive trips on the Dolphin Explorer, the only large-sized dive boat that takes divers out to local waters regularly. According to NParks, there is much life yet on our shores and beneath the waves. “We have seen improvements in our coastal and marine habitats, despite Singapore’s busy waters,” said Dr Karenne Tun, director (coastal & marine) of NPark’s National Biodiversity Centre. For example, the corals here have shown signs of recovering from coral bleaching events that happened in 1998, 2010 and 2016, she added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/diving-raffles-lighthouse-an-underwater-hunt-for-trash-and-10401468"}, {"datetime": "09 Jun 2018 06:42AM", "tags": ["mental health", "schizophrenia", "IMH", "depression", "well-being"], "author": "Lee Ying Ying", "title": "Commentary: Schizophrenia, a life increasingly detached from reality", "content": " SINGAPORE: It was a cold night in January. A sudden clap of thunder woke me up from a fitful slumber and disoriented me. Somehow seized with the notion I was under surveillance, I thought to myself: “The world is ending”. Something moved near me. I bolted upright. “Are you awake?” my sister whispered. “What’s happening to me?” I responded, confused. She crept up to my bed and put her arms around me; I hugged her close. I was diagnosed with a brief psychotic disorder when I was 25. A few episodes later, doctors revised their diagnosis to schizophrenia, a form of psychosis where an individual’s thoughts and perceptions become increasingly detached from reality. Often misconceived as a person having a split personality, schizophrenia manifests itself in a variety of symptoms including visual and hearing hallucinations, delusions, distorted thinking and difficulties in communication. These are signs I can attest to. When the illness hits, it is a struggle to hold onto my thoughts and put them together in a coherent manner. At the height of my last psychotic experience in December 2017, I was convinced that I was a test subject forced to participate in a scientific experiment. Conspiracy theories loomed large, and my erratic thoughts were frightening to deal with. Yet, the symptoms subsided in a week and I went back to work in February after an extended break. THE ROAD TO RECOVERY It was encouraging to learn that more than half of patients who experienced psychosis recover completely or at least show significant improvements, according to studies from a number of countries in the 1970s to 1980s. Many healthcare professionals are seized with “clinical recovery”, a remission from or reduction in symptoms, and restoration of functions in a patient with the disease. To doctors, schizophrenia is a medical illness, a result of changes in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain that controls language, abstract thinking and appropriate social behaviour, as a result of stress and other triggers. But those who suffer from mental health issues favour the idea of “personal recovery”, and in rediscovering anew life’s meaning, purpose and hope while living with the disease. A widely-cited definition of personal recovery by famed healthcare expert William Antony of the Boston University’s Centre for Psychiatric Rehabilitation describes the process: Recovery is a deeply personal, unique process of changing one’s attitudes, values, feelings, goals, skills or roles. It is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful and contributing life even within the limitations caused by illness. Recovery involves the development of new meaning and purpose in one’s life as one grows beyond the catastrophic effects of mental illness. Medical treatment and psychiatric forms of therapy, including widely used cognitive behavioural therapy, may help to reduce symptoms but those who suffer from it value the journey of recovery, including finding a purpose and their place in the community. Sometimes part of this rehabilitation process includes re-engaging with work, in developing a repertoire of actions that aid with recovery. A person who has lost a limb due to diabetes may not be able to grow one back, but may consider himself recovered when he adapts to the loss and finds ways to lead a productive life. It is similar for people with mental health issues. I’ve met so many people in the course of my work who go on to live gratifying lives and form meaningful relationships, despite their struggles with mental health issues. WHAT DOES RECOVERY MEAN TO ME? For me personally, recovery is about taking control, changing my outlook on life, and adapting. I have come to understand myself better than before and appreciate the importance of my emotional health. I have also grown more empathetic and sensitive towards people in emotional distress. But recovery has not been an easy journey. There was a period in my life that was filled with negativity. At my lowest point, getting out of bed in the morning was an agony. I wish I could say that I woke up one day and it all went away. But it didn’t. Recovery was a very slow, painful and non-linear process of transformation.  BARRIERS TO RECOVERY The accompanying stigma remains a huge challenge for people living with mental health issues. A person struggling with, say, depression is more likely to be told to “get a grip” than to be met with empathy and concern. People are also more familiar with dealing with anxiety or depression than psychosis. A mental health literacy study conducted in Singapore in 2016, Mind Matters, found that the majority of respondents think that persons with mental health issues are “weak, not sick”. Even a person suffering from depression may be telling himself to be stronger and more diligent about turning his life around. Stigma prevents people from seeking the help or taking the rest they need. Can you imagine a person running a high fever struggling to get out of bed to go to school or work, yet refusing to see a doctor? Many people with mental health issues are doing exactly that. In the Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2010, the time taken for patients to seek help for major depression was four years, and nine years for bipolar disorder. That is a long time to live with a disease.  IT TAKES A VILLAGE No man is an island. It takes a lot of support and understanding from the people around to help someone recover from a mental health issue. You may be a family member, a friend, or a co-worker to someone living with a mental illness. A word of encouragement, a simple meal, or a listening ear can make a world of difference. As Stephen King so eloquently wrote about mental health issues in The Body: The secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear. From my experience, the simple act of someone providing a safe space for me to share my inner thoughts without the fear of judgment made the sum difference. It is okay to tell us you don’t know what to say, or just stay silent in the moment. I did not get out of the terror of psychosis on my own. My family and friends’ unwavering support for me in the last five years played a huge role. On another note, it is important for friends and family members to provide space for the person in recovery. Being overly concerned and getting on the person’s case may aggravate the situation. Recovery from schizophrenia is a lifelong journey, a balancing act and those of us who once suffered from the terrifying grips of the disease know we need all the support we can get.

The 39-year-old Malaysian has to cross a small road which needs maybe just five steps but bucketloads of courage, to negotiate packs of roaring, honking motorcycles tearing down a bend toward him. Zero quarter is given by these riders, who throttle their engines to tackle the slight incline while yelling to intimidate Han and other clutches of pedestrians gingerly pottering at the side, anxiously waiting to make a run for it. Traversing this part of the Causeway - which lies close to the Malaysian end - takes a formidable mix of experience and anticipatory skills, according to Han. Already he has witnessed two accidents here over four years of walking the 1km-long link, as part of his daily commute between home in Malaysia’s Johor Bahru city and his workplace in Singapore’s Jurong. Once, the engineer at Creative Technology was even knocked over by a fellow pedestrian who’d been plowed into by a motorcycle. This fraught crossing is just one of multiple ordeals faced by some 300,000 Malaysians - according to a 2016 government report - who opt to cover the Causeway on foot every day. Emerging from Johor Bahru’s Customs, Immigration, and Quarantine Complex (CIQ), there are no footpaths or traffic lights, only signs warning and discouraging pedestrians. “It’s quite dangerous for us to walk along the road where the cars are quite fast,” said Han. In the middle of the Causeway, large stone slabs prevent motorcyclists from parking at the side - but also force pedestrians to walk even closer to oncoming traffic. Entering the Singaporean half of the bridge, a pavement leading to Woodlands Checkpoint finally appears, though overgrown shrubbery renders it single-file only. “Most of us walk because we have no choice - the jam is bad,” said Han. “If not, we would rather take the bus.” Whether by foot, public transport or personal vehicle, hundreds of thousands of Malaysians endure a daily journey beset by pedestrian perils, severe traffic gridlocks, crawling customs and much more - all to make a living down south. Their predicament came to the fore during campaigning for Malaysia’s 14th general election in May, and with a brand new government installed since, expectations are high that improvements will come - something local lawmakers themselves are acknowledging. “We will look at the Causeway that is getting increasingly congested,” said Johor’s new chief minister Osman Sapian. “Our Home Affairs Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin will come down and observe how to resolve related problems at Johor and the Second Link (at Singapore’s Tuas). “Importantly, the congestion at the Causeway must be overcome by whatever means,” he added, reflecting the position taken by other Johor state exco members. “WE ARE COMMITTED” Motorcyclist Razali Tompang was once ensnared in a Causeway jam lasting up to four hours, but he considers the last few weeks of commute his most trying yet. “It’s now fasting month - Ramadan - so I’m tired and dehydrated, and I’m sitting there with dust and exhaust generated by vehicles, plus people smoking cigarettes illegally,” said the 40-year-old professional, who has been riding from the Johor Bahru suburb of Larkin to his office in eastern Singapore since 2007. Razali said the late-2016 implementation of an automated gantry system for motorcycles (M-BIKE) at CIQ helped speed things up for a while - but disorder was quickly restored with riders jumping queues and some counters still shut at 5am when bikes are already pouring in. “The new government could increase the number of counters and make sure they’re open,” said Razali. “It’s been proven: On election day, when the immigration department said they would operate the counters at 100 per cent, there was really not much jam and we cleared everything smoothly within half an hour.” Meanwhile, Han wondered if it was possible to speed up immigration and reduce manual checks on the Singapore side. “For the automated gate, time to pass through requires 14 seconds but the counter manned by the officer takes more than one minute,” he said. “I hope the federal level government will come in with suggestions too - that would mean something.” On May 30, transport minister Anthony Loke confirmed the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) would proceed, even though another major infrastructure project, the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR), looks set to be halted by Malaysia. When up and running by 2024, the RTS will connect Bukit Chagar station in Johor Baru to the upcoming Woodlands North MRT terminus. The aim is to reduce Causeway congestion by up to 15 per cent, with the RTS able to carry 10,000 passengers compared to the 300 fetched by the current Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) Tebrau Shuttle. Johor state exco chair for investment Jimmy Puah told Channel NewsAsia he knew of residents in his Bukit Batu ward waking as early as 2.30am to get to work in Singapore by 5am. “With the RTS and better connectivity, I hope their travel time will be shortened,” he said. “But in the meantime, we have to think of more ad-hoc measures - perhaps building travelators on the Causeway. There are security issues of course, but we’re trying to think out of the box and look at several angles. “We want to make sure people can travel to and from Singapore in a much smoother manner, and we are committed to solve the issue of jams, in whatever manner.” Fellow state executive councillor Dzulkefly Ahmad suggested diverting traffic away from the Causeway by reducing toll charges at the Second Link - a move which the former government said it would consider at the start of the year. He, along with local government exco chair Tan Hong Pin, also urged the need to promote public transport by cutting down on fees and adding more buses. Johor expert Dr Francis Hutchinson, who leads the Malaysia programme at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, agreed.  “By increasing parking spaces in strategic locations, coupled by good quality bus services, for example, the transit time could be made easier and less onerous,” he said, while proposing other “low-hanging fruit” such as increasing manpower at crossings at strategic times or making toll charges time-sensitive. “AS LONG AS IT’S 1:3” When he first started working in Singapore in 2009, delivery driver Arayani Aini would get severely worked up by the daily jams at the Causeway. These days, he’s just numb. “If I get angry, it’s not at the congestion, because that’s normal. I get angry at fellow commuters,” said the 29-year-old. “They don’t abide by the rules and don’t work together to ensure everyone goes home efficiently. Sometimes motorcyclists enter the car lanes; sometimes car drivers use the motorcycle lanes; and sometimes lorries drive on the wrong lanes. If everyone has the right attitude, the congestion will be reduced.” Arayani’s worst experience was during the long Easter weekend in April, when he left Singapore at 5.30pm and reached Johor at 1.30am - an astonishing eight-hour debacle that forced him to exit his car to stretch his legs. “If the exchange rate falls to 1:2.1 or maybe even 1.9, I’ll be prepared to reconsider. But as long as it’s 1:3, I will continue working in Singapore,” said the father of one. Han, his fellow commuter, said this strength of the Singapore dollar against Malaysian ringgit was the main reason for a “huge surge” of his compatriots crossing the Causeway to find work, with some descending from other states to buy or rent houses in Johor Bahru. Razali, however, said it was also about equal opportunity. “A lot of Malaysians are going to Singapore to work because it’s all merit-based - if you do well and work hard, you will get your rewards. “In Malaysia … we know it’s always about cronyism, and who you know to get you into both government and private jobs. This was then and I hope with the new government, these kinds of things will stop,” he said. “Because given a chance, of course I would want to work in Malaysia and contribute to my country.” Johor chief minister Osman said he would not - and could not - prevent Malaysians from working in Singapore, but promised his government would “try to create something good”, whether in terms of jobs, salaries or standard of living, for them to come back and serve their own country. “Let’s say a Malaysian is getting S$2,000 a month, about RM6,000. If we can get a job for them paying RM4500, a lot of them will be willing to come back,” said assemblyman Tan. “Because when they work in Singapore, they are sacrificing their personal life, social life, time with children and family ... It will be worth it if they can work in Malaysia with a bit of a lower pay, but gain back all these other things.” Enticing Malaysians to return home to work is the “ultimate goal”, said his colleague Puah. “But of course with Singapore’s exchange rate, it’s always better prospects there. Unless we bring it down, the economic side of things dictate themselves.” “Those things won’t happen overnight,” said Liew Chin Tong, an academic and former member of parliament who lost narrowly at the last election, but remains a key figure in the ruling Pakatan Harapan coalition. “We hopefully will see some results within five years. And by that time Malaysians - especially Johoreans - can go to the polls at least knowing there are more jobs; better jobs; better-paying jobs,” he continued. “And perhaps the Malaysian economy will be in better shape, with the ringgit strengthened because we have better fundamentals, and eventually the number of people who’re prepared to come back to work in Malaysia will be more than before.” This is the final part of a series looking at how the change of government in Malaysia is being felt in Johor. The first three parts discussed tourism, race-based policies and the role of royalty.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/causeway-johor-bahru-commute-second-link-10408244"}, {"datetime": "09 Jun 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["disability", "New Zealand", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Derrick A Paulo", "title": "Left half-paralysed in a holiday crash, she walks at her wedding three years on", "content": " SINGAPORE: It was a “beautiful day” in Glenlorchy, in New Zealand's South Island, and the scenery was “gorgeous”, with mountains, open fields and a lake. Ms Jean Ling Ching Yee was driving on the aptly named Paradise Road. All it took was a split second of checking the rear-view mirror - and the next thing she knew, the car was skidding. \"I kind of saw a cliff down the road. I was trying to avoid the cliff, and I turned far right, back onto the road,” she said. “That was when I hit a tree.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Later, the police would tell her that there was no cliff, and it had been a trauma-related memory sprung from fear. But on that day, all she knew was waking up in the car in pain, her life changed forever. “I couldn’t feel my lower body, so I thought that my whole body was amputated. But when I looked down, my legs and my body were still all attached,” the 35-year-old recalled of that day in March 2014, on the programme On The Red Dot. (Watch the episode here.) “Blood was coming out of my mouth. I couldn’t breathe that well, and I started to press the horn before I fainted.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She was five minutes from her destination, a horse ranch where she'd planned to go riding with her companion, when her car crashed.  Ms Kelly Louise Morritt, who lives close to the accident site, still remembers hearing “the screech of tires and a massive bang”. She was surprised to find Ms Ling still alive. \"The car was pretty awful,” recalled Ms Morritt, who ran back home to call the ambulance. The Singaporean was flown to the hospital in the country’s southernmost city, Invercargill. She had punctured lungs and fractured ribs – three on the left and two on the right.  “They had to insert a metal rod to pump out the blood inside my lungs so that I could breathe well,” she recounted. Her companion, amazingly, had only minor injuries. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"I WAS LIKE A BABY\"  But worse news was to come. As the doctors kept touching her “from head to toe”, she thought to herself, “What are they trying to do?” They were testing her for sensation – and she had none from the waist down. Her spinal cord was “severely cut”. The first thought was, ‘Oh no, how am I going to carry on with my life? How am I going to work? How am I supposed to take care of my mum when she’s old?’. For a young woman who loved travelling and exploring new places, trying things from horse-riding to rock-climbing, it must have been a gripping fear to find herself immobilised.  “I couldn’t control my bowels. I had no balance; I had no core muscles. I was like a baby. From dressing up to cleaning up and showering, everything started from zero,” she said. She was flown to Christchurch’s Burwood Hospital, where she spent four months undergoing rehabilitation, and crying “every night”. Her brother and sister-in-law as well as three of her friends took turns to visit her. It was their love and concern - most especially her mother's - that Ms Ling drew strength from. The former accompanied her through those long months, staying with a family living near the hospital. “Her concentration was all on me.” “I told myself that I needed to be strong because there were still lots of people who cared for me, who wanted to see me stand up again and be myself again.” And so, she took to her physical therapy with determination. Ms Eny, who goes by one name, said her paraplegic friend kept a “brave front”. “Even the therapist mentioned that she was one of the faster learners. And from what I saw, she was doing things very well,\" she said. But on her return to Singapore, Ms Ling's feelings of helplessness returned almost immediately – when she found she could not enter her home by herself. “People had to carry me, with my wheelchair, in.\" “I couldn’t reach things any more. I couldn’t take my clothes that were hanging up there. I couldn’t enter the toilet freely. Every time, I had to call for people to help. It was, “Ma, can you help me with this? Ma, can you help me with that?   She felt terrible, like she had when she'd just had her accident – “that kind of feeling that I was going to have to start all over again...  I just went to the living room window and burst out crying.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"IS THIS LOVE TRUE?\" The question of whether anyone could love and accept her in a wheelchair was one of the first thoughts she had in hospital. Her doubts grew when her then boyfriend, who was her travel partner in New Zealand, left her because he was unable to handle her disability. Then about three years ago, Ms Ling met Jake Oh through mutual friends. They were not close initially, she said, but as time passed, he “expressed his love” for her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At that point, however, she had yet to regain her faith in love. “Is this love true?” she asked herself. (But) he used his love and patience to touch my heart. He told me, ‘It’s fine. Time will heal, and my love will heal you. It’ll prove (itself) to you.’ So it did. On Dec 23, 2017, they got married. And the bride “arranged a surprise” for her groom at their wedding dinner, which also fulfilled her own dream - of literally walking down the aisle. “I didn’t want to roll myself in; I wanted to make the day very memorable. I secretly trained myself to walk. And I tied myself with equipment to straighten my legs,” she recounted. The day came, and using a walker, she pushed herself to make her entrance on her feet, clad in a beautiful white gown, and in heartfelt tears. “It was so emotional that day,” said Ms Ling, who now has a “good husband who knows how to cook and doesn’t complain”. Their flat for their life together was designed for wheelchair access. “There are some places high up that I can’t reach, but with some technological enhancements, I can actually dry my own clothes,” she said. Mr Oh, who sometimes works overtime and night shifts, wants her to be capable of such things. “I’ll try and accommodate her when I’m around,” said the 28-year-old. “I also have to let her be independent when I’m not around.” WATCH: A journey of grit and love (6:09)  A NEW LEASE OF LIFE It was a trip back to New Zealand, some months before their wedding, that roused Ms Ling’s can-do attitude again. Back there for a medical check-up in July last year, she did things she had never done as a person with disability. Adaptive skiing, for example, was “fun”, despite her lack of balance. Skydiving was another sport they tried. And she managed to “complete” her journey by going horse riding. “It was difficult. I did a small circle, and it freaked me out so badly because I didn’t have any balance,” she admitted. But she kept going – “through the woods, and the snow and the trees”, the movie-setting she had hoped for three years ago when she first set out for the ranch. “The feeling was awesome. It was so good,” she said triumphantly. She also revisited her accident site in Glenorchy town. The trees were gone, the open field there was fenced up and “the feelings were totally different” in the cold of wintertime. \"It was very emotional,\" she said. In a sense, I was back to the place that changed my whole life. But also, I was back to a place that gave me a new life. As part of that fresh start, Ms Ling is now looking forward to having a family of her own. “I still can conceive, and there’s no problem with me at all,” she said. But having a baby \"will be another challenge again\". With a confident smile, her husband added: “I don’t think it’ll be that challenging because our love has overcome everything.” Buoyed by the knowledge that people with worse conditions than hers are still travelling, Ms Ling has also told herself that there are more things to do, places to go and people to meet. “You just have to pick up the courage, and learn to take the first step. You just tell yourself that you can. Being disabled won’t stop you from doing that,” she said. “You just have to try. If you try and fail, nobody will blame you.” Jean Ling is one of four Singaporean travellers who shared their stories of terrifying misadventures abroad with On The Red Dot. Watch this episode here.

Tina Datta, chairman of the local chapter of Republicans Overseas, said that it makes “complete sense” given the \"safety and security that Singapore presents\". “One of the things we’re definitely looking forward to is perhaps a peace agreement between North and South because many of us residing in Asia are knowledgeable about the pressures and conflicts that occur in Asia from a historical standpoint. So bringing a resolution to the ongoing conflict in Korea would just bring a sense of peace towards the Northern Asian region,” Ms Datta said. However, some wonder if the summit will achieve this given the concerns over Trump’s approach to diplomacy.  Singapore-based Democrats Abroad member Patricia Reed said that while the American community is hoping for a “win-win solution”, it will be hard without a full team of experts who understand the area and have experience working with US’ allies. As an example, she pointed out that the position of US ambassador to Singapore, remains unfilled. “Trump must recognize that complex, international situations require a strategic and principled approach that is guided by our diplomatic and military experts and involves our key allies. In this regard, it is very helpful that Singapore has stepped in to support the talks,” Ms Reed said. WATCHING FROM A DISTANCE While about 30,000 Americans living here will enjoy a courtside seat to the historic event, both local Republican and Democrat chapters, as well as the American Club and American Chamber of Commerce, will not be organising any special activities around the summit.  And unlike the Singapore Korean International School, which is planning to screen the summit, there are no plans by the Singapore American School and Stamford American International School to do so as their students are on summer break. There will also not be any engagements with the visiting US delegation. “There’s no time or engagement because this is not a social meeting. It’s completely regarding national security and defense,” said Ms Datta. Meanwhile, they have been following developments closely in a WhatsApp group and sharing their thoughts with one another. \"I can imagine any American, whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, have to be happy that this meeting is taking place and hope for the best. Every citizen in Singapore, everybody who is living in Asia should be very full of hope that this level of a meeting is taking place so that progress can be made towards bringing peace to the Koreas,\" Ms Datta added.

Findings from the investigations suggest that wildlife are present in the area, with camera traps picking up the presence of animals such as the Sunda Pangolin and the Lesser Mouse-deer, said the authority. The alignment of the CRL, which is targeted to be completed around 2030, has created some controversy among environmentalists and nature groups as the direct alignment option goes directly underneath the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. A second skirting alignment option goes around the reserve. The site investigations took place between May 2016 and September 2017 as part of efforts to assess the feasibility of the two CRL alignment options.  \"Monitoring results from cameras and transect surveys from the (site investigation) works for the direct alignment suggested that fauna are present in the area,\" said LTA.  Photos released by LTA showed Sunda Pangolins both before and after the site investigation works near Sime Trail in the reserve. “Our camera traps picked up (the) presence of animals like the Sunda Pangolin and Lesser Mouse-deer after the completion of SI works. The findings were encouraging and validated the mitigation measures developed,” said Dr Goh Kok Hun, LTA’s director of civil design and land.  Mitigation measures involved efforts such as reducing the number of boreholes required, from 72 to 16, and making sure these were on existing trails and clearings within the nature reserve, according to LTA. The findings of the site investigation works will provide LTA with information on underground soil conditions, as well as provide input for Phase Two of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which will assess the impact of construction and operations for the two alignment options. Phase Two is ongoing and is expected to be completed later this year. LTA said it has been in close consultation with nature groups on the studies, and will continue to engage them on the CRL. The authority said it would finalise the CRL alignment after results from Phase Two of the EIA have been studied and discussed with stakeholders.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wildlife-seen-in-cross-island-line-site-investigations-10408818"}, {"datetime": "08 Jun 2018 05:09PM", "tags": ["Organised Crime Act", "Illegal gambling", "Remote Gambling"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Man who collected up to S$640,000 worth of illegal bets convicted", "content": " SINGAPORE: A remote gambling \"agent\" who collected up to S$640,000 worth of illegal bets over four years became the first to be convicted for offences under the Organised Crime Act on Friday (Jun 8). Or Poh Soon, 55, a Singaporean, on Friday pleaded guilty to offences under the law, which came into effect in June 2016. He was one of six people from an organised crime group charged in November last year under the law, which is targeted at crime syndicates. The court heard that sometime in 2012, Or, a newspaper vendor then, was recruited by Lean Kay Chong, one of three leaders in the group. Lean, whose case is pending, used to get his newspapers from Or outside Beauty World Centre. Lean told Or, who was earning S$50 a day, that he could earn extra income by working as an illegal gambling agent under him, collecting 4D and Toto bets. Or would need to source for his own punters. He would get a commission of 8 per cent of total bets collected, and an additional 5 per cent of the winning amount, if his punters struck the lottery. Or started work in January 2013 and, over time, had at least 20 regular punters placing illegal 4D and Toto bets with him. They would call or text him on his mobile phone to place their bets. Or would consolidate these bets and text Lean. Court documents showed that, up until his arrest in November 2016, Or earned up to S$62,000 in commission on the bets alone. OR KNEW ABOUT WIDER GROUP The syndicate consisted of three leaders, a chief runner, three administrative staff, two IT technicians and four shareholders. The group divided its operations into three main clusters that actively collected bets. It had a total of about six 4D and Toto websites, court documents showed. Between Jun 1 and Nov 27, 2016, the group had an estimated turnover of S$26.6 million, the court heard. Lean was one of four shareholders and led a cluster made up of an IT technician, a runner, a \"master agent\" and agents who collected bets entered into www.peng888.com. He would also receive a cut of the profit from two other websites. Or knew that he was involved in an organised crime group with wider links to other people unknown to him, Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia said. Lean's cluster alone had 95 agents, of whom only six, including Or, have been arrested, the court heard. Or admitted to three charges, with another charge taken into consideration. DPP Teo said that she will be seeking a two-year jail sentence and a $40,000 fine. For his offences under the Organised Crime Act, he could be fined up to S$100,000, jailed up to five years, or both. Under the Remote Gambling Act and Common Gaming Houses Act, he could be fined between S$20,000 and $200,000, jailed up to five years, or both. The cases against others involved in the syndicate are pending. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-collected-up-to-s-640-000-worth-of-illegal-bets-10407928"}, {"datetime": "08 Jun 2018 05:00PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Trump-Kim summit: Slow traffic, closures expected around St Regis, Shangri-La, Capella hotels", "content": " SINGAPORE: Motorists can expect traffic delays and disruptions from Saturday (Jun 9) on roads surrounding the Special Event Areas in the run up to Tuesday’s Trump-Kim summit.

Businesses are relentlessly using technology to trim costs and create new products, driven by a motive to maximise profit but it is in society’s interest that businesses also employ technology to other ends. The disruptive nature of technology naturally creates unemployment and consequently job vacancies as old business models wither and give way to new ones. The complications of technology’s disruptive nature manifest in two ways. The number of displaced workers is likely outnumber new job vacancies in the short term. At the same time, the presence of these new job vacancies implies that existing workers subsequently retrenched do not have the new skills needed in these new roles. POCKETS OF LAYOFFS Some say Singapore seem to be coping fine with disruption, where it was recently reported that Singapore’s GDP in the first quarter grew 1.7 per cent, while unemployment and retrenchments over the same period have fallen. While retrenchments have fallen to a seven-year low, suggesting an improved economic outlook with fewer firms needing to lay off workers, we have to be mindful that there may be still pockets of layoffs in some firms and sectors due to technological disruption and business restructuring as the economy transforms, NTUC assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said a month ago. So we must train the unemployed and retrain workers fast. In this, technology must be employed to train workers to fill out these job vacancies to keep pace with technology’s creation of unemployment. It is only when we can use technology to convert unfilled job vacancies to filled vacancies that we can say technology is neutral to job markets. But technology is not neutral to job markets now. As long as companies are motivated to employ technology to create new business opportunities, products and services and are financially rewarded so, the training role of technology in reskilling workers to fill new roles will lag behind. To the extent that there is little business imperative for companies to aid workers to transition into new roles, it can be said that there is market failure in training and government intervention should be expected. But how to intervene is not so straightforward. HELP WORKERS MOVE INTO NEW GROWTH AREAS A typical firm normally will use 70 per cent of its resources to at least maintain their market share in existing products, devote 20 per cent to boosting related products and focus 10 per cent on creating new products, based on business surveys. Companies use technology to compete in all these three lines of activities.  As we expect, new technologies will lead jobs engaged in the production of existing products to be redundant while there may be both job displacement and new vacancies in the production of related products. Most new roles are created in the production of new products. Since all three activities are under one top management, it seems incumbent on company leaders to make reskilling existing workers a priority so that job vacancies can be filled quickly by people already familiar with the company’s operations and practices. The most agile and innovative companies already attract strong talent yet so many organisations are obsessed with chasing after new talent rather than retaining those they have. A mindset shift may be needed where the most vulnerable workers in this regard are matured, middle-aged workers. Reskilling a company’s current manpower, rather than looking for, onboarding and training young hires, seems like a more time and cost-effective approach to human capital management for companies. From a macro-economic perspective, it is also a more efficient approach to job-skills matching in a tight labour market, and as the economy restructures. It is also better for the firm and for society if all firms reskill their workers in order to help them keep their jobs. Retrenched, matured workers may otherwise spend months and years searching for a new position and gaining needed skills to be competent in their role. Where companies already expend resources to help talent progress through the ranks within, there is a case to be made for companies to similarly focus on reskilling existing workers with the required skills to prepare them for another job within the same firm. To a company, it is a question of marginal cost versus marginal benefit. If a worker is redundant, the firm will retrench him or her. If a new position is required, the firm will recruit from the labour market. But if reskilling is cheaper, the firm will retrain the worker and transfer him or her into the new role. INCENTIVISE FIRMS TO RETAIN WORKERS From a public policy perspective, we should reduce the costs of reskilling and increase the costs to companies if they do not reskill their workers. The Government can and has done this through a mix of tax incentives, grants and other catalysts. Over recent years, it has introduced initiatives like SkillsFuture and worked through organisations like the Labour Movement to enhance job matching for the Singapore workforce. The Government also understands the need to aid older workers who may be the most vulnerable group. A new tripartite workgroup will be set up to look into the concerns of older workers, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo recently announced, highlighting that one in three workers in Singapore is above 50 and have anxieties about the future as technology disrupts businesses and jobs. All firms in Singapore need to foot a Skills Development Levy under the Skills Development Levy Act. Payable at 0.25 per cent of the monthly remuneration for each employee, and administered by SkillsFuture Singapore, the funds are used to subsidise firms when they retrain their workers. The Government could tap on these funds to give more subsidies to firms who reskill existing workers for new roles in the firm’s growth areas. By helping firms to fill positions of potentially high growth, this also supports our public policy objective of encouraging innovation and supporting companies who take calculated risks. When firms reskill existing workers for the production of new products, there is little economies of scale and the new product may be risky and short-lived. So reskilling rather than hiring can save companies recruitment and other transactional costs involved in setting up a new team, making innovation “cheaper”. The psychological benefits can also be immense as the firm’s manpower sees that firm is innovative and at the same time, looks after their interests. A blunt tool is to give firms that do not reskill their workers a lower priority in terms of Employment Passes for foreign job applicants, but this may not be appropriate to all sectors, especially those experiencing a talent crunch or smaller companies and start-ups that might have less flexibility in hiring. Another option is to boost job matching for retrenched older workers. In this, the Government could encourage internships for this segment of the workforce and reward firms if they eventually hire them with a good wage. Some defrayment of wages is already provided through the Career Support Programme but it doesn’t encourage firms to retain workers after 12 months when support tapers off. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT  The best way to improve the lives of Singapore's workers is gainful employment, in good jobs with good wages, said Labour Chief and Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Ng Chee Meng on Tuesday (May 15) in Parliament. “It is critical that our businesses take the lead and do the right thing, that when our workers do their best, remember to share the gains with their workers and give them what is fairly theirs”, he said. This also applies in helping older, matured workers deal with disruption, where they in turn can contribute back to a company’s goals, given their years of experience and knowledge of the business. So we should focus our efforts on tackling this chief manpower challenge.

When Mdm Tan, who works in an administrative job, couldn't service the bank loan and credit card payments, her furniture was seized - twice. \"My children saw it,\" she said, breaking down and reaching for a pack of tissues. \"I was at my wits' end and I didn't want to approach family members to let them know my situation. \"This is the irony,\" she lamented as she recalled the text message she received in 2013 which made things go from bad to worse. \"Now the whole world knows it and I have to tell the media.\" THE TEXT MESSAGE The SMS was for a moneylending service accompanied by a company name and telephone number. Mdm Tan checked it out online and thought it looked legitimate. Increasingly mired in debt, she gave her most personal particulars - screenshots of her identification card, her company's name and address, and even her SingPass login details - to engage the service. The moneylenders also asked how many family members she had and where her children studied, but it was not enough to raise alarm bells. \"The money came fast,\" she admitted. Cash was transferred to her via iBanking within days. It started with S$20,000, then the amount \"snowballed\" into the hundreds of thousands. When Mdm Tan couldn't pay off one of her loans due to the exorbitant interest rates and ever-changing terms, she borrowed money from another loan shark to settle it. It became a vicious cycle. \"At first, it could be monthly payments, but next week they would say: 'Hey your payment is up',\" she said. When she told the moneylender of the original terms, the usual reply would be that the guy who gave it had gotten into an accident. Mdm Tan's mobile number was also circulated as quickly as the money. Soon, she found herself in debt with more than 50 different moneylenders. She borrowed from friends and colleagues and worked three jobs to try and pay off her debts. \"It was quite a substantial amount,\" she said. THE THREATS Mdm Tan would soon find out that these loan sharks were ruthless. \"When I couldn't pay on time, they sounded harsh and scolded me,\" she said. \"They started to threaten me, and no one, including my husband, knew of my situation.\" The loan sharks would send threatening messages like \"I know where your children study\" and \"I know where you work\". In 2015, the loan sharks shifted gears and started sending WhatsApp messages instead of SMSes. In March this year, Mdm Tan got a message which she described as the \"last straw\". \"I received an SMS cursing my family and threatening to kidnap my children,\" she said. \"They also sent me videos of a burning housing unit.\" Mdm Tan reported the matter to the police and stopped engaging the loan sharks. She estimates that she has paid around S$400,000 in total, with S$150,000 to go. But the harassment got physical. Two months ago the loan sharks spray painted the walls outside her home and threatened her neighbours. \"They told my neighbours that I said they'd be my guarantor,\" she said. \"About 50 per cent of them knew about it.\" The loan sharks also sent unsolicited fruit baskets, McDonald's and Pizza Hut meals to her home. And they called up her employers and shouted at her colleagues. Fortunately, she said her three school-going children never encountered the loan sharks personally. \"I don’t know how to face my children,\" she said. \"On one hand, I’m telling them to be frugal and spend only on what they need, but on the other hand, I’m borrowing. \"But they know I’m alone handling this whole thing.\" THE ADVICE In light of her \"painful\" and \"traumatising\" ordeal, Mdm Tan advised the public never to borrow from loan sharks.  \"I urge anyone who really needs financial help to seek the correct agency or welfare institution,\" she said. \"Because the agony I went through - at the start you may not feel it, but the moment you're out of help, that’s when the worst will come. \"Everybody will know and I don’t know how to lift up my head.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/how-one-woman-fell-prey-to-loan-shark-unlicensed-moneylender-10402394"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 08:47PM", "tags": ["transport"], "author": "", "title": "Woman arrested after appearing naked at Pioneer MRT station", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 35-year-old woman was arrested after she appeared nude at Pioneer MRT station on Wednesday night (Jun 6).

They include government policy, supply and demand, customs environment, as well as transparency and trade.  While Singapore performed above the global and Asia averages in the first three categories, it had a poor showing in transparency and trade which pulled down its overall score to 71.1.  In this category, Singapore scored 45.6 – below the world and Asia averages of 52.6 – to be ranked joint-56th alongside Columbia. The report described Singapore as continuing to “remain a study in contrasts” when it comes to transparency and trade.  This is because while it did well in indicators, including the tracking and tracing of consignments, it was given a low score when it comes to the monitoring and oversight in the FTZs.  “There are laws and regulations in Singapore but in our research and interviews with various experts, the consensus was that customs officers and other law enforcers are virtually non-existent in the FTZs,” said Mr Chris Clague, EIU’s managing editor for Asia and global editorial lead in trade and globalisation.  When assessing Singapore’s customs environment, researchers working on the report also found a lack of a customs recordation system that intellectual property (IP) owners can use for enforcement at the borders, he added. Meanwhile, Singapore remains one of the economies that has not adopted Annex D of the Revised Kyoto Convention on free zones and customs warehouses, said TRACIT’s director-general Jeffrey Hardy. To improve, Singapore will need to beef up governance of its free trade zones by having customs supervision of the zones’ perimeters, entry and exit points and among others, implement “Know Your Customer” and “Due Diligence” measures, the report said in an accompanying recommendation paper.  REGULAR ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS IN PLACE: SINGAPORE CUSTOMS In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, Singapore Customs said there are manned customs offices located within all FTZs and regular enforcement operations are conducted. “As we had informed the Economist Intelligence Unit earlier this year when its staff were preparing this report, there are customs offices manned by officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in Singapore’s FTZs,” the spokesman said. “In addition, there are also customs offices manned by Singapore Customs officers within three FTZs – Pasir Panjang Terminal, Brani Terminal and the Changi Airfreight Centre,” the emailed response added.  The spokesman said officers conduct “targeted and random checks” on goods and activities in all of Singapore’s FTZs to ensure that tenants adhere to rules and requirements. Recent enforcement operations include one in Jurong Port in March and another in Keppel Distripark last month.  As for the lack of a recordation system, the spokesman said: “Singapore does not require right holders to register their trademarks separately with Singapore Customs under a recordation system as Singapore enforcement agencies have access to the Trade Mark Registry to check and verify the validity of trade mark registrations and the contact details of the right holders.”  “As Singapore is neither a source nor a major destination for intellectual property rights (IPR)-infringing goods, an additional recordation system, on top of the Trade Mark Registry, does not necessarily allow for efficient targeting of containers suspected to carry IPR-infringing goods.”  Hence, Singapore adopts the international practice on the Lodgement of Notice system, where right holders provide Singapore Customs with information identifying specific containers suspected of containing IPR-infringing goods.  This has worked as “right holders do provide specific, actionable and timely intelligence to Singapore Customs, who will work with the ICA to seize and detain the identified containers”, added the customs spokesman.  Overall, Singapore adopts a “whole-of-government approach” in countering illicit trade, said Singapore Customs.  “Such enforcement approach extends to the FTZs where all Singapore laws apply and law enforcement agencies are able to enforce their laws and conduct necessary operations to crack down on illegal activities occurring within the FTZs.” ASIA-PACIFIC MUST DO MORE TO FIGHT ILLICIT TRADE The global report named Finland as the country with the best environment to prevent illicit trade. It had an overall score of 85.6, followed by United Kingdom (85.1), United States (82.5), New Zealand (82.3) and Australia (81.0).  Among the four regions examined for this report, Europe is the best-performing region after topping all categories in the index.  Asia-Pacific, which includes 21 economies, came in second though researchers of the report said more needs to be done to keep illicit trade at bay as a disparity in capabilities remains.  Apart from New Zealand and Australia, Hong Kong (78.4), Japan (78.2) and South Korea (75.4) made up the top five Asian economies best-equipped to nip out illicit trade flows.  On the other end of the spectrum, however, Cambodia (30.6), Laos (26.8) and Myanmar (22.6) remained vulnerable due to capacity, skill, institutional and resource constraints.  This disparity can be attributed to the varying levels of economic development in the region, said Mr Clague. Singapore and other developed economies in the region will “need to take some initiative” to help their less-developed peers, he added.  “The issue of illicit trade is important not just how it violates things like intellectual property (IP) rights … but how it also helps to fund, in its various forms, transnational organised crimes and international terrorist networks.  “As the region becomes more integrated economically, the countries that score poorly can create vulnerabilities for countries across the region,” said Mr Clague. “They are not isolated.”  As such, the report recommended the region’s policymakers to call upon organisations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to drive multilateral actions, strengthen national inter-agency collaboration or tap on private sector expertise.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-ranks-24th-in-fight-against-illicit-trade-needs-better-10400370"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 07:58PM", "tags": ["public transport", "MRT"], "author": "", "title": "Freon gas leak forces passengers to alight at Tanjong Pagar MRT station", "content": " SINGAPORE: Passengers on board an eastbound train were forced to alight and board the next train at Tanjong Pagar MRT station on Thursday morning (Jun 7) because of a freon gas leak.

Yet the South Korean national, who runs the iSpeak Korean Language Centre, says she has neither seen nor spoken to any of her Northern neighbours or people entering the embassy since they moved in two years ago. Ms Choi's experience is consistent with the extremely low profile Singapore's small community of North Koreans has kept in recent years as diplomatic pressure on their home country made travelling and working abroad increasingly difficult. But they have disappeared in recent years as UN sanctions tightened around Pyongyang, and Singapore has been among the countries that have dutifully implemented resolutions to cut trade ties, ban transactions with North Korean banks and cancel the work passes of its citizens. North Korea's place in the world - and that of its diaspora - comes into focus in Singapore next week, when the city-state hosts the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will discuss ending the North's nuclear weapons and missile programmes in return for diplomatic and economic incentives. Singapore, a global trading and financial hub, was once home to a close-knit group of a few dozen North Korean diplomats and businessmen responsible for channelling money, fuel and goods to the secretive state. While it still maintains diplomatic ties, North Korea's embassy has moved from a three-storey property in a lively neighbourhood of heritage shop-houses to its present unassuming home. \"I hope to see them one day. Since the North and South Korean relationship is getting better, I may even be able to speak to them,\" said Ms Choi. Reuters has visited the North Korean embassy multiple times over the last year but on all but one occasion there appeared to be nobody there. Reuters did once meet the embassy's first secretary, Ri Pyong Dok, while he was entering the embassy in February 2017, but he declined comment. In a call in recent weeks to the embassy to ask about preparations for the summit, a North Korean staffer also declined comment. It has four North Korean officials and their spouses in its list of diplomatic and consular staff as of June 2018. STRATEGICALLY MANAGED \"The sanctions and the pressure that were put on by the US and its allies were definitely ... key motivating forces that encouraged him (Kim Jong Un) to consider engaging more, and to come out and have this summit,\" said Mr Nicholas Fang, director of security and global affairs at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. North Korea has always strategically managed its expatriate population, mainly sending them to allies like China and Russia, where they feel they will not be corrupted by Western ideals. Singapore is probably the most diplomatically neutral place where they've based people historically - more for trade reasons than diplomacy, said Mr John Kim, a Korean-American businessman who advises a non-profit offering training in entrepreneurship and business in North Korea. Kim said he had not spoken to a North Korean in Singapore in around five years. The last person John Kim spoke to told him there were around 50 North Koreans operating in the city-state, mainly in industries like shipping, although there are no official figures of the size of the community. In contrast, there are about 20,000 South Koreans living in Singapore. In November, Singapore suspended all trade with North Korea to comply with tightening UN regulations. In March, Singapore said it had revoked the work permits of all remaining North Koreans in the country. A long-time South Korean resident of Singapore who did not want to be named said until a few years ago, groups of North Koreans would come into South Korean-run restaurants for barbecue dinners and would sometimes strike up casual conversations with the South Korean patrons or staff. They would be relaxed and friendly, though there was occasionally tension in the banter, reflecting the rivalry between the two states, he said. One more prominent North Korean figure in Singapore was Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of the current leader who was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur airport last year. A socialite, he often drank at a plush bar on the top of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel or in one of the city-state's many karaoke joints, according to one of his friends, who declined to be named, citing safety reasons. The friend said Kim Jong Nam was down-to-earth, self-deprecating and open to jokes about his family connections. \"We would always ask, 'So Kim, what do you think about communism?’ and he's was always saying, 'I'm all about peace and love.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/as-kim-arrives-in-singapore--no-north-korean-comrades-in-sight-10402876"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 06:24PM", "tags": [], "author": "", "title": "Former terror suspect from Australia denied entry into Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: Former terror suspect Zeky Mallah, 34, was denied entry into Singapore after arriving at Changi Airport from Sydney on Wednesday (Jun 6).  Zeky was denied entry on account of his \"terrorism-related antecedents\" and was placed on the next available flight back to Australia on Thursday morning, a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday. \"Zeky was the first person to be charged in 2003 under new terrorism laws in Australia for allegedly planning a suicide attack on the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Department of Foreign Affairs,\" the spokesperson said. \"He was later acquitted of two charges of preparing a terrorist act in 2005, but received a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to threatening violence against Commonwealth (Australian government) officials.\"  There were also reports of Zeky travelling to Syria, expressing support for Al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups as well as the rebel group Free Syrian Army, the spokesperson added.  While he was detained, Zeky had reached out to Australia's Seven Network before his phone was confiscated by Singapore airport authorities, said media reports.  Zeky had told a Seven News reporter via phone that he was kept in a holding cell, where he was questioned for around five hours.  \"They asked me a number of questions about my history, my dealings with the Australian goverment, ASIO, my trip to Turkey, Syria,\" he was heard saying through a video phone call that was televised.  Zeky also believed that him being denied entry had to do with the upcoming Trump-Kim summit planned for Jun 12.  \"I think the last thing they need is someone with my history to be in the same country as them,\" he said.

Kabir Md Alamgir, 45, had on Oct 9, 2016, barged into the shower cubicle the boy was in. He then sexually assaulted and performed oral sex on the boy for two to three minutes. In their sentencing submissions, the prosecution said that Kabir had “brazenly” committed the offence in a public swimming complex, affecting the public’s sense of safety and security. It asked for Kabir to be given, at the minimum, eight years' jail and four strokes of the cane. Parents legitimately expect that they can let their older children use public toilets and showering facilities freely on their own, the prosecution added. “The victim is entitled to feel safe in a public space like the swimming complex. In fact, he had always felt safe, changing in the buff with abandon in the open areas of the male toilet,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong.  Kabir’s violations, however have “gravely undermined” the teen’s rightful sense of comfort and security, she said. The victim has not stepped foot into the complex since, and took a long time to start swimming again, she added. Kabir \"audaciously\" barged into the victim’s cubicle in broad daylight in a public swimming complex, and forcibly performed oral sex on him despite the fact that others could have caught him red-handed, she said. In asking for a deterrent sentence, the prosecution pointed to how Kabir had targeted the victim, who had his weekly swimming lesson at Toa Payoh Swimming Complex. Kabir spoke to the victim on occasion over seven to eight months before the offence, and also once scrutinised his body, asking why he had not been circumcised. “It was therefore no coincidence that on the day of the offence, the accused had arrived at the complex just before the victim ended his swimming lessons not carrying anything in his hands,” the prosecution said. After the offence, Kabir left the complex without swimming. For sexually assaulting the victim, Kabir could have been jailed for up to 20 years, as well as fined or caned. One other charge of using criminal force with intent to outrage modesty was taken into consideration. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/toa-payoh-swimming-complex-bangladeshi-sexual-assault-jailed-10401598"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 03:25PM", "tags": ["Singapore Police Force", "crime"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Loan sharks shifting from splashing paint to harassing on WhatsApp, police say", "content": " SINGAPORE: Loan sharks are now shifting their harassment tactics. Instead of damaging property by scribbling O$P$ in red paint on walls, they are now harassing the public via SMS and WhatsApp messages, police said on Thursday (Jun 7). \"Through the method, the loan sharks are able to target larger groups of people,” they said. According to the police, the number of harassment cases which do not involve property damage has gone up 17.5 per cent to 942 cases in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year. This trend was also observed in 2017, when cases without damage to property increased by 33.8 per cent to 2,783 cases as compared to the year before. In all, unlicensed moneylending-related harassment cases increased by 12.3 per cent to 3,806 cases last year. This is “largely driven by the cases without damage to property”, police said. Besides targeting larger groups of people, the use of technology allows loan shark syndicates to harass debtors at a quicker pace, head of the Unlicensed Moneylending Strikeforce Superintendent (Supt) Han Teck Kwong said. \"Of course, the intensity and seriousness of the harassment messages will be there,\" he added. Supt Han said these messages might be accompanied by pictures or videos of homes being set on fire or their gates chained by the harassers. These messages can also progress to physical threats made against family members and employers, he added. \"Their business model thrives on fear, so in order to compel victims to pay up, they’ll try all means.\" To lure victims in the first instance, Supt Han said the loan sharks send out unsolicited advertisements to randomly generated numbers. Once the debtor engages an unlicensed moneylending service, his number will be circulated to other loan sharks, Supt Han added. This results in a vicious cycle of borrowing money from other loan sharks to pay off existing debts. The police advised those who receive SMSes or WhatsApp messages from loan sharks not to reply or interact with the sender. The public should also “report the number as spam and block the number using readily available spam filter applications”. They can also notify the police via the i-Witness portal or report loansharking activities anonymously through the X-Ah-Long hotline at 1800-924-5664. TACKLING THE ISSUE In the bigger picture, the public should not borrow from unlicensed moneylenders and stop getting involved with unlicensed moneylending activities, the police urged. “The police will continue to work closely with authorities such as the Info-communications Media Development Authority to deter these harassment acts,” it said. The police said it is also working with other relevant agencies and telecommunication companies, but are unable to reveal more details due to operational considerations. When asked about potential measures like blocking mobile numbers belonging to loan sharks, the police said they will \"work closely with relevant stakeholders to make it harder for unlicensed moneylending harassers to conduct non-damage and non-confrontational tactics\". \"We want to make it harder and to disrupt the operations of unlicensed moneylenders,\" Supt Han explained. What if loan sharks use number spoofing or encrypted WhatsApp messages to avoid detection? \"We are exploring all angles to work with all agencies involved to try to detect and prevent such technology from being used,\" Supt Han said. \"There are challenges, but we will ensure we work continuously with the relevant agencies to tackle the issue.\" Under the Moneylenders Act, first-time offenders found guilty of carrying out business as an unlicensed moneylender or assisting in the business of unlicensed moneylending face a fine of between S$30,000 and S$300,000, a jail term of up to four years, and six strokes of the cane. Also under the Act, first-time offenders found guilty of committing loanshark harassment may be jailed up to five years, receive three to six strokes of the cane, as well as a fine of between S$5,000 and S$50,000. Last month, the police arrested 131 suspects believed to be involved in loan-sharking activities following a four-day operation. Police said three of them allegedly carried out acts of harassment by splashing paint and scrawling graffiti on walls. \"I also urge all members of the public, including foreign domestic workers, not to borrow from loan sharks and to desist from all unlicensed moneylending activities and involvement,\" Supt Han said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/loan-sharks-shifting-from-splashing-paint-to-harassing-on-10401456"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 02:40PM", "tags": ["GovTech", "Digital Government Blueprint"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "More opportunities for SMEs as Singapore Government reveals multi-billion-dollar IT spending plan", "content": " SINGAPORE: There are opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore to be had as the Singapore Government revealed a S$2.4 billion to S$2.6 billion IT spending budget for the new financial year. According to the Government Technology Agency’s (GovTech) press release on Thursday (Jun 7), these SMEs accounted for almost two-thirds of the total number of ICT contracts awarded by the Government in Financial Year 2017. In dollar value, they were awarded about S$800 million of the S$2.4 billion set aside for that period. The agency added it expects this trend to continue in the FY18 cycle of procurement tenders.  Of the forecasted budget, 33 per cent will go towards keeping the lights on for existing IT systems such as a PC bulk tender for leasing of personal computers and buying of printers, GovTech said. There will also be a bulk tender to qualify a panel of companies to provide resources to support co-sourcing of projects with GovTech. The bulk of the budget, or 44 per cent, will go towards supporting transformation projects such as the National Digital Identity system as well as smaller scale projects like the Singapore Tourism Board’s Singapore Visitor Centre system. The latter empowers frontline officers with visitor information and services and the ability to provide tourists with tailored recommendation, GovTech said. Another 23 per cent will go towards growing the ecosystem, such as through a bulk tender for robotic process automation. This tender will support the implementation of such automated processes in Government agencies via a panel of companies qualified to provide the software tools and professional services needed, the agency explained. The plans were revealed just days after Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean launched the Digital Government Blueprint that, among other things, spelt out the key performance indicators public agencies should work towards to in the next five years.  Some of the initiatives include having electronic payment and digital signature options for all digital services provided by the Government.  CUTTING DOWN CLUTTER GovTech cited the example of cutting down the number of times a business will have to transact with the Government in order to create and start a business.  For instance, in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, a new entrant would have to go to eight agencies and apply for 14 different licenses such as fire and safety and hygiene ones just to get their business off the ground. These applications are across different agencies and websites, which makes navigation - especially for first-timers - potentially daunting.  Adopting a service journey mapping approach, GovTech’s intention is to consolidate these transactions and enable aspiring F&B entrants to submit the data once for all the licenses instead of the numerous times currently. While the initial focus will be on the F&B sector, this approach would subsequently be widened to other fields as well, Channel NewsAsia understands. Within the public sector, GovTech said public officers can look forward to better IT services through the Digital Workplace programme. With the Digital Workplace mobile app, civil servants will be able to access corporate services such as booking meeting rooms and car park lots on the go. They can also synchronise and view their calendars - which was previously only available on their work PCs and laptops - on their personal mobile phones, the agency said. This app is meant to just be another way to enhance the capabilities of public servants and is not mandatory for all to use. There are already other services to aid in collaboration internally, such as Workplace by Facebook, within the public sector. “We are excited by the many opportunities to collaborate with the industry, and are currently engaged on many project discussions with them,” said GovTech chief executive Kok Ping Soon. “We look forward to working with the industry in using technology to improve the lives of citizens, serve businesses better, and provide effective and convenient public services.” Mr Kok had joined the agency in May this year, taking over from his predecessor Jacqueline Poh. The announcements were made at GovTech’s annual Smart Nation and Digital Government industry briefing, which was attended by about 1,000 from the industry, academia and public agencies.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-opportunities-for-smes-as-singapore-government-reveals-10401548"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 02:34PM", "tags": ["Singapore Mint", "Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "North Korea", "United States"], "author": "", "title": "Out of stock status for Trump-Kim commemorative medallion due to 'technical glitch': Singapore Mint", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Mint said on Thursday (Jun 7) it is still taking orders for all three commemorative medallions that were launched to mark the highly anticipated summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  In an email, the Singapore Mint explained that the out of stock status was a \"technical glitch due to overwhelming traffic\" on its website.  \"The Singapore Mint is still continuing order taking for all three medallions, including the gold medallion,\" it said, adding that the closing date for orders is on Jun 12. A check on the Singapore Mint website on Thursday showed that the gold medallion, along with the silver and nickel-plated medallions, are still available for pre-order.  However, a message on the website stated that there has been overwhelming demand for both the gold and silver medallions, and balloting may be necessary. \"Item is subjected to balloting if demand exceeds the allocation for Singapore,\" the message read. \"Orders are not guaranteed until the ballot results are out.

There are no further plans to increase the mintage in order to \"ensure the exclusivity of the medallions\", said The Singapore Mint in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia on Thursday.  There is no fixed mintage set to the nickel-plated medallion to ensure all interested collectors have a keep sake to mark this momentous summit, it added.  The Singapore Mint had said earlier that fewer than 200 pieces of the gold medallion and 2,000 pieces of the silver medallion would be allocated to Singapore. It did not say if the allocation to Singapore will also be increased, given the overall increase in the pieces of gold and silver medallions that will be minted.

Details below. Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more exclusive events. SINGAPORE: Within 20 minutes of meeting Simone Depalmas, the Italian chef had already convinced us that it was a good – no, an infallible – idea to pack our bags at once and move to Sardinia. This was not just because he was feeding us with creations inspired by the Italian coast such as squid ink tagliolini with king prawn and bottarga, and smoked mackerel on grilled polenta cakes, showcasing the culinary heritage of his home country. But as we were stuffing our faces, the 40-year-old chef – who has lived in Singapore for the past five years with his wife and son – also showed us his selfies relaxing on the beach against a backdrop of white Sardinian sand and impossibly turquoise waters. And it became increasingly clear that the only life worth living was the Mediterranean island life. Depalmas is the executive chef of Sinfonia Ristorante at the Victoria Concert Hall. Formerly FOO’D By Davide Oldani, the restaurant was rebranded in April, retaining the same staff and decor but offering a whole new menu. Having worked with Michelin-starred Oldani to open the restaurant in Dec 2016, Sinfonia now offers a menu designed by Depalmas himself. And you're invited to explore his Mediterranean flavours right here in our tropics. On Jun 28, Chef Depalmas is hosting a special five-course dinner – showcasing exclusive off-menu items and canapes. This is the latest in a series of exclusive events from CNA Lifestyle Experiences. One notable off-menu item is the Mediterranean sea bass. The large fish, weighing between 4kg and 6kg, is flown in from Italy and served just off the bones from a live station. “It is simply baked in a sea salt crust. When guests arrive, I open it up at the station. The flesh is very white and very juicy – it’s amazing. I serve it finished only with extra virgin olive oil, because the quality of the fish is super,” he said. “This kind of dish can only be done when you have very fresh fish.” When it comes to seafood especially, Depalmas is very particular about showcasing its freshness. “For me, this is the best way to eat fish. It’s the same with live prawn or scampi – just steam or grill it and finish it with olive oil. Don’t put any sauce on top – if you do that, it’s because you want to cover the taste. It makes no sense,” he asserted.  Back home in Sardinia, “When I’m on the beach, I take the shellfish straight from the sea and eat it – it’s so fresh.” SEA URCHIN PASTA AND BRULEED CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE It’s easy to think that he’d rather be working on his tan at home in Italy, but he also loves living in Singapore, he said, citing the ready availability of good food late at night as one of the reasons. Many of his dishes are a nod to local obsessions, such as angel hair served with sea urchin. “In Singapore, you put sea urchin on everything,” he chuckled. Then there’s a cauliflower soup that he’s very proud of. “This one is so nice. In Singapore, you like cauliflower so much. But it’s interesting because I put roasted prawn on top,” he said, which gives the flavours more dimension. There’s also his chili crab pasta. “I make it with trofie pasta, which is very interesting. It’s a handmade pasta typical in the Liguria region. You prepare long pieces, press each one, and move down the line, one by one,” he said. One of the dishes that left a silly smile on our faces was his bruleed chicken liver mousse with truffle, served with roasted focaccia. The burnt caramel crunch – dare we say it? – rang out in symphony with the unctuous liver flavoured with wines including Madeira, marsala and port. But we’re not sure if it was also because Chef had generously invited us to come and grill with him on the beach in Sardinia, showing us photos of little brown piglets sizzling merrily in front of crystal waters, white sand and an azure Sardinian sky. “Back home, after work, I go straight to the beach and have a drink. Everybody knows me. I grill with ingredients as simple as aubergines – I roast them for hours until they’re black outside and creamy inside, and then I just scrape out the insides and eat it on bread,” he said, smacking his lips happily.

Mr Heng was speaking to Singapore media on Wednesday (Jun 6) during his nine-day visit to China, which ends on Friday. His comments come on the back of growing trade tensions between the US and China. In March, the US announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. China responded by halting tariff concessions on US products including pork and fruits. Mr Heng stressed that it is crucial to avoid further escalation. \"I think the Chinese leadership has exercised restraint in their comments and they are putting in effort to avoid such an outcome,\" Mr Heng said. \"And I would say that even the US leadership is aware of the potential impact of this. A trade war will have very destabilising effects on the global economy, first and foremost,\" he said. \"I think it will have a rather unpredictable impact on the financial markets in the first instance.\" Mr Heng said it was not too long ago when the world saw a global financial crisis, adding that it was important to not \"meddle with this rather potential flashpoint\". \"I believe that the serious thinkers on both sides appreciate the implications. What I hope does not happen is any miscalculation. Because in a major negotiation like this, the risk of brinksmanship is always there. I hope that it does not happen,\" he said. PROMOTING FREE TRADE Mr Heng said it is also important to promote free trade. \"Within ASEAN, we are consolidating the ASEAN Economic Community. We are negotiating ASEAN agreements with China and with all our key partners and there is strong interest to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,\" he said. But he added that it would not be easy, particularly during this period when there are elections happening in various countries. \"But I think we should try. The very fact that we stand by free trade and that we seek to enhance cooperation is itself a very important signal, so I hope we continue to do that and make progress in that area,\" he said. But Mr Heng also warned that there are also those who will lose out as a result of free trade - which is why it is important to address structural issues. \"While free trade benefits parties in the broadest sense, there are winners and losers in free trade. Countries will have to look at polices that can help losers adjust to new configurations. That’s why in our case, we always have free trade policies and that's why we take economic restructuring so seriously, in particular, the retraining of our workers, to make sure that our workers continue to have good jobs, continue to enjoy a rising standard of living,\" he said. BOOSTING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES Mr Heng's visit to China included trips to Nanjing, Shanghai and Beijing. In Nanjing, he attended the first Sino-Singapore Artificial Intelligence Forum.  \"I think China is investing very serious effort in this area. There's a very high level of awareness both at the political leadership as well as the leadership of the companies,\" Mr Heng said.  \"The people value the convenience, they value the efficiency, they value the variety that this technology can bring.\" To speed up the adoption of AI in Singapore, Mr Heng said it is important to invest in research and development, and to try new business models. Another crucial factor is to address issues relating to data confidentiality and ethics. \"The machine itself doesn't make decisions. It doesn't make moral decisions but what we program into the machine and the algorithm that guides its decision will have very important moral implications and we have to get a common understanding of our people as to how this decision will be executed,\" he said. CONTINUING GOOD TIES WITH CHINA During his visit to Nanjing University, Mr Heng stressed that Singapore's younger leaders will continue to maintain close ties with China. As a fourth-generation minister himself, he also shared his impression of China's younger leaders. \"I met Chinese leaders at various levels early on,\" Mr Heng said. \"From my first visit in 1990, to around 1997 when I accompanied Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on many of his visits here. Over the years, I've interacted with them in various forms – the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ministry of Education. \"What strikes me about the Chinese leadership is that the Chinese leaders are selected from a very rigorous system. \"When I look at the CVs of Chinese leaders, when I spoke to them about their experience, it is clear to me, they have undergone a series of tests before they are where they are. So in terms of abilities, it is impressive,\" he said. And to ensure that Singapore can take its friendship with countries in the region further, Mr Heng said it is important to understand its own development priorities, as well as those of the other parties. This way, Singapore can build on what has been achieved by its previous leaders. Mr Heng is expected to meet Singaporeans living in Beijing on Thursday. He will conclude his trip on Friday.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/us-china-trade-war-and-its-impact-on-the-global-economy-heng-10400026"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 06:29AM", "tags": ["Trump-Kim Summit", "North Korea"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "South Koreans in Singapore want Trump-Kim summit success, end to Korean War", "content": " SINGAPORE: South Koreans around the world will be closely watching events in Singapore next week to see if the United States-North Korea summit on Jun 12 will be a success. Those living here will have a ringside seat to the historic event, and everyone that Channel NewsAsia spoke to on Wednesday (Jun 6) said they have high hopes that the meeting will pave the way for a security breakthrough on the Korean Peninsula. They want US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to declare a formal end to the 1950 to 1953 Korean War, which only stopped after an armistice, not a peace treaty, was signed. Such a declaration is important, they said, because South Koreans back home want to stop living under the threat of war, and that most people hope for eventual reunification. The South Koreans here also said they were pleasantly surprised that Singapore was chosen to host the “special” meeting, adding that they will “definitely” be tuning in for a slice of the action. “If it’s successful, it will be better for South Korea and the world,” waiter Lee Dong-il, 48, said during a busy lunchtime shift at the Obba Jjajang restaurant in Tanjong Pagar, whose main drag is littered with Korean barbecue and noodle eateries. Mr Lee, who has been living in Singapore for a decade, said he “never expected” that the city-state would host the summit, adding that he will be following developments closely. Down the road at the Koryo Mart, businessman Kim Sun-cheon, 52, had just finished shopping for groceries. “Every Korean is the same,” he said. “We want to make peace.” Mr Kim added that he would like to see the two Koreas reunite, even if it happens “20 or 50 years” in the future. “We are never thinking about two countries,” he stated. “We always think, just one.” At another Koryo Mart in nearby Telok Ayer, store manager Kwon Se-hoon, 47, said he welcomes the summit and echoed calls for peace and reunification. “We were always ready for war. Very tragic,” he said softly as K-pop tunes blared in the background. “That's why all Korean people want peace.” Mr Kwon added that it was “very special” that Singapore was chosen for the summit, especially as it brought together leaders of countries that historically were never on friendly terms. While homemaker Jang Yun-ji, 31, also hopes for a successful summit, she wants the US to stop meddling in affairs on the Korean Peninsula. “Trump always makes it messy,” said Ms Jang, who has been living in Singapore for 10 years. “We have to talk more with North Korea.” Ms Jang said it was “amazing” that Singapore was picked for the summit, but added that she might have to give it a miss because she’s leaving on Thursday for a holiday. “It’s a very big day,” she added. “I’m so sad that I won’t be here.” \"I REALLY WANT TO GO THERE\" At the Singapore Korean International School tucked away in a leafy Bukit Timah private estate, the summit is a big deal too. Politics teacher Lee Deok-hyoung, 38, said there are plans to screen the summit in school, adding that he has discussed the summit with his students, who expressed similar hopes for peace. Likewise, Mr Lee hopes for a declaration to end the war so South Koreans back home can stop living \"nervously\".  Mr Lee added that Singapore is the \"best option\" to hold the summit as it has good relations with both North Korea and the US. \"It's amazing because I am directly watching it on this ground,\" he continued. \"I really want to go there, but I know I cannot.\" Student Kim Do-hyung, 18, said the school also spent an entire period screening the meeting between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, adding that the event \"touched\" many students. He expects the upcoming summit in Singapore to be equally significant, hoping it would lead to more cooperation between the two Koreas and eventually reunification. \"This will reduce tensions in South Korea and make citizens feel more secure,\" he said. SOUTH KOREA'S ROLE Amid reports that Mr Moon might also attend the summit, the South Koreans interviewed said they would try to meet him if their schedule permits, as they praised his policy of pursuing peace with the North. \"I think the Korean government played a very visible role to make this summit happen,\" Mr Lee said at the school. \"The two countries had a lot of problems with each other before this.\" Mr Lee added that it would be an honour to meet Mr Moon in person. The Republic of Korea Embassy in Singapore did not immediately respond to a request for comment on plans to engage the South Korean community here in the event Mr Moon attends. However, Yonhap News Agency reported on Monday that South Korea is still watching negotiations between the US and North Korea to determine whether Mr Moon travels to Singapore. Meanwhile, the Korean Association in Singapore said it has put up posters in support of the summit in the Tanjong Pagar area. It might also organise a get-together at 9am on Jun 12, when the summit takes place. Professor Sumit Agarwal of the National University of Singapore said he expects a joint declaration of an end to the Korean War to come out of the summit. But he cautioned that \"the bigger goal of eliminating nuclear weapons from the peninsula and unification are far-fetched dreams at this point\".", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/south-koreans-singapore-want-trump-kim-summit-success-end-war-10398230"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 06:29AM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "Sentosa"], "author": "Matthew Mohan", "title": "'Business as usual' for Sentosa attractions during Trump-Kim summit, despite some challenges", "content": " SINGAPORE: Less than a day after an announcement that the summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be held at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa, Mr Putera Alexavier was being contacted by worried patrons.  \"Since they found out that this (summit) was going on here, my phone has been ringing,\" the events and marketing manager of Mambo Beach Club told Channel NewsAsia.   \"They were asking whether we were affected in any way, whether we would be closed or will operate as per normal. So we did reassure them that while there might be a delay on their side - in terms of security checks (on our end), I doubt there's going to be any issues.\" According to a public order published in the Government Gazette online on Tuesday (Jun 5), Sentosa and the linkway to the island from Harbourfront have been designated as a special event area for the upcoming summit. Extra security measures will be in force on the island in the period between Jun 10 and 14. Within the special event area, there will be a special zone where stricter security checks will be conducted on people and vehicles. The special zone covers an area that includes Universal Studios Singapore and the Capella hotel.  However, Mr Alexavier believes that business at his establishment, located along Siloso Beach, will not be affected. \"We are not expecting more people to come into Sentosa or Mambo itself. What we will be expecting is the usual crowd that always comes here,\" he said. \"Ninety per cent of our customers are regulars anyway.\" Founder and CEO of iFly Singapore Lawrence Koh agreed that it will be \"business as usual\" at the skydiving center, also located along the Siloso Beachfront. \"As the summit will be largely confined to the Capella's compound, we don't forsee disruptions to the rest of Sentosa's attractions, including ours,\" said Mr Koh.  \"However, with the increased security measures during that time, we advise customers to come earlier for their flight sessions in case there are any delays in getting into Sentosa.\" Nonetheless, some businesses expressed concerns that the summit could cause logistical problems, such as delayed delivery of food supplies. According to a staff member at Bali Thai, a restaurant at Resorts World Sentosa, a supplier had already called in to say that they will be unable to make deliveries between Jun 10-18 due to circumstances arising from the summit. \"They have advised us to order in advance, which is not how it normally works,\" said assistant manager Rojanie Tiongson. \"For now it is one supplier, but I am not sure what will happen in the coming days.\" The Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) said in a statement that it \"seeks the understanding of guests, residents and other island stakeholders visiting the areas in the vicinity of Capella Singapore\". \"SDC would like to reassure locals and tourists that it will be business as usual at Sentosa's various unique leisure offerings and we look forward to welcoming everyone to the island,\" said an SDC spokesperson.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/business-as-usual-sentosa-during-trump-kim-summit-10398926"}, {"datetime": "07 Jun 2018 06:29AM", "tags": ["Go-Jek", "Grab", "Ryde", "Jugnoo", "Carousell", "ride-hailing"], "author": "Nitin Pangarkar", "title": "Commentary: When Go-Jek enters Singapore, what consumers, drivers and delivery services can expect", "content": " SINGAPORE: The last few months have been interesting and eventful for the shared transport and ride-hailing industry in Singapore. First, after a fierce battle for market share, Uber announced it would exit Southeast Asia, which raised concerns about impact on two key stakeholders in Singapore — drivers and customers. Some analysts (and the Consumer and Competition Commission of Singapore, or CCCS) were concerned that being the lone player in the space, Grab would use its newfound monopolistic potential to extract value from drivers (by reducing incentives for instance) and customers (including offering fewer discount codes).  READ: A commentary on the Grab-Uber merger and the likely impact on prices for ride-hailing services. Since then, there have been some reports of Grab pulling back on incentives and discounts. Fast forward a couple of months, there are new developments in the story. Many companies have expressed interest in entering the ride sharing space, including local firm Ryde and India’s Jugnoo. The most notable and widely anticipated entry is that of Indonesian giant Go-Jek, which has strong backers, a market capitalisation comparable to Grab, and demonstrated success in its huge home country. It had announced in May that it plans to enter Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries “in the next few months”. So what can consumers and drivers expect and what might be Go-Jek’s strategy when it lands in Singapore? RAMPANT DISCOUNTING UNLIKELY TO RETURN Let us first examine what may be in store for consumers. The return to the rampant discounting which benefited drivers and customers when Grab and Uber fought a fierce battle may be less likely. While Go-Jek may be tempted to try aggressive discounting in the short term to quickly acquire market share, it will likely have calculated that this particular path will be fraught with losses and uncertainty. Grab already enjoys a large market share. Go-Jek would have learnt from Uber’s embattled experience in Southeast Asia, where Uber was forced to cut losses and retreat, even though it managed to sell off its operations to Grab for an undisclosed sum and a 27.5 per cent stake in Grab. It is noteworthy that when Uber stepped away from the aggressive pursuit of market share in Southeast Asia, its profitability improved. Uber had burnt through at least US$8 billion since its founding in 2009, inclusive of US$1 billion in losses in China alone, which eventually led it to sell its business there in 2016 to Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing. After witnessing years of ride-hailing companies bleeding funds to capture market share, many with little success in a winner-takes-all sector, wary financial backers of such firms, including Google and Tencent, the big names backing Go-Jek, may not support money-losing strategies. But despite the likely absence of fierce battles for market share powered by a price war in this space, I believe that the threat of competition, whether from new entrants or from incumbents such as ComfortDelGro becoming more effective alternatives, will keep prices in check, at least in the foreseeable future. In other words, the prices for ride-hailing services will most likely be higher than the levels seen during a full-blown price war, but lower than monopoly prices, despite Grab’s large market share.  GO-JEK’S SUCCESS WAS IN ACHIEVING RAPID SCALE Go-Jek was successful in Indonesia because it fulfilled a unique local need - overcoming the traffic gridlock - and devised a business model to effectively address that need. A second reason for its success was its rapid scale-up. Within first 14 months of the app’s launch, it had logged more than 100 million transactions. Few companies in Southeast Asia can claim to have scaled up so much, so fast. Go-Jek then extended that business model to a variety of other services such as courier services, food delivery, housekeeping and cleaning services, and grocery delivery, which helped it maintain a large network of drivers, even outside of peak hours. It has since gone on to claim 50 per cent of Indonesia’s ride-hailing market and 95 per cent of its online food delivery market by 2017, according to Go-Jek CEO Nadiem Makarim. For Go-Jek, which had a four-year first mover advantage, the subsequent competition in many of these services was not intense enough to unseat it, and its competitors lacked the technological skills it had in acting as a match-maker between providers of services and customers. Go-Jek also focused its marketing efforts on recruiting drivers to entrench its delivery reach and speech, and provided them with onboarding assistance. CHOOSING STRATEGIES  In entering Singapore, Go-Jek has to choose among a few difficult strategy options. The first option of going after market share in the traditional shared transport space will mean offering hefty discounts to drivers and customers. Once a price war starts, it is difficult to stop unilaterally. Yet the attractiveness of the shared transport sector is in Singapore may be limited or at least not as rosy as some analysts believe, with its prospects possibly diminishing over time, as the MRT network becomes more extensive and the reliability of transport services improve, especially as servicing works progress. The second option involves replicating the wide suite of services Go-Jek offers in Indonesia. Here, the challenge lies in the fact that there are existing players who operate with a reasonable level of efficiency. The food delivery pace in Singapore is well populated and there are many courier services in Singapore as well. Grab has also recently made an aggressive move into the food delivery space and intends to compete aggressively with the numerous existing players such as Foodpanda and Deliveroo. With a fierce battle looming in this space, and a price war brewing, short-term profits will likely be scarce. LIKELY MOVE: PARTNER LOCAL FIRMS AND SEE HOW The third option involves selectively replicating its Indonesian business model in Singapore while being cognisant of the differences between the two countries’ environments, as well as its limitations and strengths. From my perspective, Go-Jek’s strengths include its ability to scale up rapidly while engaging its stakeholders. It has established good relationships with its partners, drivers as well as local Indonesia governments, without having to spend large sums of money on driver incentives, as Uber tried to do. It is useful that Go-Jek recognises that it has to partner local founding teams to run operations and give them the autonomy to decide on the best business direction to take, to ensure good local traction, while it provides technological support. Mr Makarim had said, in announcing Go-Jek’s plan to enter Singapore and other Southeast Asian markets two weeks ago: Our role will be to act as advisors, giving the new companies the benefit of our operational and development experience so they can take the spirit with which we created Go-Jek and find the best way to achieve that locally. If it can replicate those advantages, albeit with modified strategies, in Singapore, Go-Jek may be able to compete effectively or even gain a leg-up on competitors such as Grab. So it might look to venture out to provide on-demand services in housekeeping, cleaning or fixing (such as electrical or plumbing services), where there is less competition at present and service levels from individual providers are unpredictable and variable. It could also partner brick-and mortar or freelance service providers to deliver these to app users at their doorstep. To achieve rapid adoption, it might also look at partnering popular consumer marketplace platforms that amalgamate such services like Carousell if they can provide a convincing value proposition. In conclusion, like any other firm entering a new market, Go-Jek needs to have a carefully considered approach to garnering market share, while being aware that what has worked well in its home market may need to be at least tweaked, if not changed significantly to adapt and succeed in Singapore’s context.

But two years ago, when he was only 46, Mr George Chong was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer’s, an uncommon form of dementia. There was no cure, the doctor told him – and he slowly began to lose control of his daily life. Over time, he found it hard to follow instructions, do simple calculations and, sometimes, even distinguish his right hand from his left. “Because of Alzheimer’s, I was very agitated. It was so bad that I even scolded my wife: ‘Why didn’t you take care of me?’” said a fit-looking Mr Chong, who was an avid long-distance runner before the diagnosis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When he could not even fill in a form and struggled to speak logically, his wife of 23 years Lynn Chong tried to dissuade him from resuming work at their tuition centre. At first, he refused to accept the reality. “He said, ‘If I’m back at work … I’ll be back to my old self,’” she recounted. “One month later, one of his colleagues called me and asked me if something was wrong. They found out that George was very forgetful.” There are an estimated 40,000 persons living with dementia in Singapore, and this number is expected to double by 2030. More alarmingly, what was once considered an “old person’s” disease is now affecting younger adults like Mr Chong, who featured on the programme Talking Point. (Watch the episode here.) By 2016, the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) Neuroscience Clinic (Tan Tock Seng Hospital Campus) was seeing a fivefold increase – over five years – in patients with young-onset dementia, which affects those aged 65 and below. WATCH: What it's like (4:09)  WHY IT AFFECTS YOUNGER FOLKS Dementia is a term that describes a number of different conditions affecting the brain, and it robs patients of their memory and daily functions. An estimated 4,000 people in Singapore have young-onset dementia. Many are still working and have young families when the disease sets in, the NNI said in 2016. A study by the institute found that these patients face substantial health, social and financial problems, as well as a diminished quality of life. “Patients are reported to have shorter survival, more rapid cognitive deterioration, greater frequency of language disturbance, as well as early and more severe behavioural changes as compared to older patients with dementia,” said the NNI. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For example, Mr Chong finally had to stop work in 2016 when his symptoms worsened. Talking Point host Steven Chia, who is two years younger, observed moments when Mr Chong would forget bits of information he had just shared with him or would have difficulty finding the right words to express himself. “Those are the kinds of symptoms that are not apparent to the rest of us,” said Mr Chia. “It’s hard to imagine what he has to live with every day.” So how can one tell if a person has dementia? The bottom line is that patients usually must undergo a magnetic resonance imaging for confirmation. What is clear is that the two leading causes of young-onset dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. The latter develops when mini strokes occur in the brain. Over time, these undetected blood clots damage blood vessels and, eventually, parts of the brain. The more common cause, however, is Alzheimer’s, a neurodegenerative disease that causes brain cell death. And when young-onset dementia results, especially as early as the age of 50, it is partly a genetic inheritance, noted Associate Professor Philip Yap, the director of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital’s Geriatric Centre. “Having a family member with young-onset dementia would definitely increase the risk … (to) the children,” he said. He added that the rising number of younger patients being diagnosed is also partly caused by the upward trend in lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, with more people suffering a stroke at a younger age. FOR A SPOUSE, LOSING 'A SIDEKICK' As dementia hits career people in the prime of their lives, it devastates both the individual and the family. Mrs Chong, who used to be a homemaker, started teaching part-time in 2016 to support her husband and their three children. “I hadn’t worked for 20-plus years … The priority has always been family. George was always the one working,” she said. I feel as if I’m doing everything myself now. It used to be that I had a sidekick, but now no longer. To add to her load, she struggles with her husband’s memory loss and cognitive decline. “Even simple things like, if there’s a bowl of food and we’re sharing it, I used to say ‘Okay, you just leave a certain portion for me’. He’d say, ‘Yeah, yeah.’ But by the time I come back, the food’s all gone,” she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Often, she has to oversee him when he does the chores, and it tires her out. “There are times when I give instructions, he nods and says yes, then he turns around and he’ll do something else,” she added. “On certain days, I think that I’m not helping him. I feel as if I’m pressuring him.” (Read the commentary: Dementia caregivers put on a brave front – while watching loved ones fade away) A PLACE TO FIT IN This year, Mr Chong found work at the Alzheimer's Disease Association’s ADAcafe in Toa Payoh, which provides a form of engagement for people with young-onset dementia. Cafe supervisor Geraldine Sim said she must brief him on his everyday tasks “each time he comes”. “That’s part of being forgetful, but we make it very light-hearted ... We don’t make a big deal about being forgetful,’” she said. We want to provide a place where they can … be themselves, knowing that whatever mistake they make, everybody is accommodating. Indeed, Mr Chong makes the effort with his tasks, which include washing dishes and serving food. While the work is a far cry from what he used to do, he is not complaining, but rather is grateful for the opportunity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ADA chief executive officer Jason Foo explained that the cafe was set up in 2016 precisely because people with young-onset dementia often cannot hold down a regular job, yet are too young to retire. He hopes that the physical and mental engagement there will slow down their disease or the deterioration of their condition. Another consideration is that other patients at dementia day-care centres or senior care centres are typically about 70 to 75 years old. “To someone who’s younger, in her 50s or 40s … it just feels completely out of place,” said Mr Foo. “When we spoke to this group of people, a lot of them said, ‘Can I do something so that I can feel I’m part of society? Don’t lock me away in a day-care centre.’” HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK To prevent dementia, the Age Well Every Day programme, which aims to help people improve their brain health and stay active, is being scaled up to more neighbourhood centres across the island. But, for starters, a healthy lifestyle always helps, said National University Health System (NUHS) senior consultant psychiatrist Kua Ee Heok, who advised against a high cholesterol diet, smoking and having too much alcohol. “These are things that lead on to high blood pressure, diabetes and narrowing of the blood vessels to the brain, and then you’re more prone to (dementia),” he said. Another tip from Professor Kua: Listen to music, which can help to stimulate one's memory. “Some people would tell me that when they heard a song, they knew exactly who the people beside them were (in the past) because the song left an imprint in their mind. It causes them happiness,” he said. And apparently, regular dancing is rated as an even better activity. One study found that it reduces the risk of dementia by 76 per cent – twice as much as reading. This is because dancing requires co-ordination that activates several brain regions, and it improves one’s mood, memory and cognitive functions, as well as relieves stress. Prof Kua also suggests walking in parks and immersing in a green environment, to get away from the urban jungle. “This is something very therapeutic. We’ve done the research and found that it lowers the heart rate and blood pressure. This is very important,” he explained. “You’re able to restore the mental faculties better – (you’re) more relaxed and able to cope with stress.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The NUHS researchers have proposed that the National Parks Board build therapy gardens round the island, so people can appreciate nature and “walk mindfully” as they get to know the plants around them. “And it’s wonderful for them because the brain functions,” added Prof Kua. While there is still no cure for dementia, the risk of developing the disease can thus be reduced in many ways, from exercising regularly and eating healthily to doing crossword puzzles and even playing certain video games to stimulate the brain.

The comments came after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at a media conference earlier in the day that his new government would review a project announced by the previous administration to form a trading link between Bursa Malaysia and the Singapore Exchange. \"MAS has asked the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) to clarify its position on the planned stock market trading link between Bursa Malaysia and Singapore Exchange, and will await the SC’s update on the matter,\" the Singapore central bank said in response to queries from the media.  Regulators from Malaysia and Singapore had announced in February that the two countries would set up a stock market trading link by the end of this year. The trading link would allow investors to trade and settle shares listed on each other's stock market more conveniently and at lower costs. It would also cover post-trade arrangements like the clearing and settlement of the stocks traded. ANALYSTS BELIEVE NO IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON LOCAL EQUITY PERFORMANCE InterPacific Securities head of research Pong Teng Siew said the review of the Bursa Malaysia-SGX Link could involve either the nature or the structure of the trading link, or it could also mean the link being abolished, which he believed was unlikely. \"The trading link aims to promote access to Malaysian stocks for foreign investors and vice-versa, so the review could be something more on the structural review rather than a cancellation. \"Perhaps the review could also include the merger of both exchanges, but I do not think so,\" he told Bernama. Nazri Khan Adam Khan, CEO and chief investment officer at Hermana Capital Bhd, believed that the review was aimed at boosting market liquidity, especially among the retail participants on both stock markets. “If the government plans to cancel it, the move will potentially upset retail investors because there are a lot of Singaporean retailers who are interested in Malaysian stocks. It will have repercussions on the retail participants and market liquidity. \"The new government would have to find ways and options to drive market liquidity again,\" he said. However, both Pong and Nazri opined that the review would not have much impact on local equity performance, at least not in the immediate term. MIDF research analyst Danial Razak agreed that the review was unlikely to have a huge impact on the underlying sentiment. \"Assuming that the trading link is to be scrapped off, we do not think it will have a material impact on the overall sentiment,\" he said. At a media conference after chairing a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Dr Mahathir was also asked if the government had discussed replacing Bursa Malaysia CEO Tajuddin Atan. Tajuddin was appointed to head Bursa Malaysia in 2011. Previously, he had been group managing director of RHB Capital Berhad. “It was not discussed. I did not see it (the proposal) on the table,” Dr Mahathir replied. Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan pulled off a shock victory at the Malaysian general election last month, ending the rule of Barisan Nasional, which had led the country for six decades since independence. The new government led by 92-year-old Mahathir is seeking to unearth suspected graft that took place during former Prime Minister Najib Razak's near-10 years in power, casting a cloud over the future of several top officials.

Mr Chris Leck, director of the Futures Division at the ministry said on Wednesday (Jun 6) that those working on AVs are “quite aware” of the need to address issues like who has right of way during a situation between a human driver and an autonomous system. There is a standards development team within the ministry working on such a framework currently. They are also looking at things like data management - “as AVs gather a lot of data\" such as video surveillance of its environment - as well as cybersecurity, Mr Leck shared during a panel session at the ongoing Innovfest Unbound event. They are also looking at international standards, such as those which relate to functional safety for cars, and how these can be incorporated into the framework, he told Channel NewsAsia on the sidelines of the event.  His comments came after another local official, Mr James Tan, shared about the experience of deploying autonomous wheelchairs at Changi Hospital - a collaboration between the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT and National University of Singapore. Mr Tan, who is the principal engineer of Sensors & IoT at Government Technology Agency (GovTech), said during the same panel session that two autonomous wheelchairs were deployed at a taxi stand at the hospital to help ferry patients and the designated distance was 200m.  While the distance was short, human traffic was heavy, he noted, adding that the algorithm had a rule that said the wheelchair must give way to humans.  In the end, it took nine minutes to travel the 200m, which was not acceptable, the GovTech official said, raising that as an example of how traffic rules for AVs can be complex and need to be carefully thought through. That said, Mr Leck shared that the “ultimate goal” is for these self-driving vehicles to be able to interact with and be part of mixed traffic situations, and they will not need dedicated lanes on the roads. AV TRIALS Singapore has been a strong proponent of autonomous vehicles for some time now, and it amended the Road Traffic Act last February in order to make AV trials a reality.  With the changes, MOT is allowed to create new rules which can place time and space limits on the AV trials, set standards for the design of the AV equipment, and impose requirements to share data from the trials. The regulatory framework can also exempt AVs, operators of AVs and those conducting or participating in trials of AVs from existing provisions of the Road Traffic Act, which make a human driver responsible for the safe use of a motor vehicle while on a public road.

The victim cannot be named due to a gag order. Annadurai Prabakaran, a private hire bus driver, started having thoughts about having sex with his flatmate, a 21-year-old Indian national, on Dec 8 last year, according to court documents. However, he had not spoken to her before, and thought she would not consent to sex. “He thus planned to drug her and have sexual intercourse with her while she was asleep,” court documents stated.  The next day, he bought two of what he thought were sleeping pills for S$2 from a makeshift stall in Geylang. He used one pill to do a test; to ensure that the pill would be colourless when dissolved. Three days later, he put the other pill into a bottle of water that his flatmate had left unattended. VICTIM SPAT OUT WATER The victim took a sip of the water and spat it out when she realised it tasted bitter. Suspecting that Annadurai might have put something into her water, which appeared cloudy, she called her uncle’s friend. The friend, a female, turned up at the home with a man. Annadurai admitted to them that he had put the pill in the water and pleaded for forgiveness, according to court documents. Then, he grabbed the water bottle from the man while he was holding it, and poured the water out. He then dropped the bottle on the floor. The man called the police, and a small amount of water that remained in the bottle was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis, the court heard. The HSA toxicology report revealed that the contaminated water contained Sildenafil, a drug for erectile dysfunction treatment. It may cause effects such as headache and nausea. Annadurai also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice. For giving the victim a substance with the intent to commit an offence, he could have been jailed up to 10 years, fined and caned. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-spiked-flatmate-s-drink-sentenced-to-jail-caning-10397584"}, {"datetime": "06 Jun 2018 04:02PM", "tags": ["transport", "COE"], "author": "", "title": "COE premiums for larger cars fall to lowest in near 8 years", "content": " SINGAPORE: Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for large and powerful cars closed the lowest in almost eight years in the latest bidding exercise on Wednesday (Jun 6).  Premiums in Category B fell to S$36,000 from S$37,989, the lowest since Jul 7, 2010 when it closed at S$35,909.

In a recent tweet, Mr Trump said the meeting on Jun 12 will \"hopefully be the start of something big\".  Here are five things you might not know about the 5-star Capella, where the rooms are upwards of S$580 a night, and a three-bedroom manor can set you back S$11,000 a night. 1. It sits on Sentosa, which was known as Island After Death Before it was named Sentosa, the island was known as Pulau Belakang Mati - Malay for \"Island After Death\". There are different accounts of the origin of the name - some say it alludes to early piracy, while another story says the island was a \"paradise\" for \"warrior spirits\" whose bodies were laid to rest on nearby Pulau Brani, according to the National Library Board.  A contest to rename the island was launched in November 1969. Sentosa, meaning \"peace and tranquility\" in Malay, was selected as the winning entry. It came into effect in September 1970. 2. Two buildings on the property have conservation status  Capella Singapore is made up of both modern and colonial buildings. Among them are Tanah Merah I and Tanah Merah II, bungalows built in the 1880s to accommodate the British Officers of the Royal Artillery, Coastal Defence Command based on Sentosa Island. Known as the Officers' Mess, it was where the officers and their families ate and relaxed by dancing and playing tennis.  They were given conservation status on Aug 7, 2000. The hotel receives its guests at both bungalows, which have been restored.  3. Its Grand Ballroom is the only circular ballroom in Singapore  The hotel's Grand Ballroom, which is the only circular ballroom in Singapore, spans 800 square metres and can accommodate about 400 seated guests. It also has a skylight dome which can let daylight into the venue or provide guests with a view of the night sky.  4. Peacocks roam around the hotel's grounds  Peacocks roam around the hotel's grounds and are a frequent feature on guests' social media feeds. They often appear by the pool, as well as The Knolls, the hotel's all-day dining restaurant.  5. It has hosted A-listers such as Madonna and Lady Gaga The luxury hotel - designed by British architect Norman Foster - has played host to stars such as queen of pop Madonna, and Lady Gaga when they stopped over in Singapore on tour. The hotel is just a five-minute walk from Palawan beach and a 15-minute walk from Universal Studios Singapore. It also offers priority bookings for the Sentosa Golf Club - a possible deal-clincher for the avid golfer, Mr Trump.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/5-facts-capella-location-of-the-trump-kim-summit-10395626"}, {"datetime": "06 Jun 2018 12:05PM", "tags": ["Dining", "Trending"], "author": "May Seah", "title": "First peek (and bite) into My Melody Cafe Singapore", "content": " Follow our new CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos SINGAPORE: It’s pink on pink – naturally – at the My Melody cafe, opening on Jun 7 at Suntec City Mall.

IMDA wants feedback on eSIM tech", "content": " SINGAPORE: Want the option of switching mobile operators with a few clicks of the mouse and without having to physically queue at a telco outlet? Enter embedded SIM (eSIM) technology, which has been identified as something that could benefit from policy and regulatory certainty and, in turn, unlock the potential of next-generation 5G networks, said Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) deputy chief executive for Policy, Regulation and Competition Aileen Chia on Wednesday (Jun 6). The agency launched a public consultation to seek views on the policy and regulatory frameworks for the deployment of the tech on Wednesday. This was announced at a 5G Workshop held in conjunction with the ongoing Smart Nations Innovation Week.  With eSIM, consumers could potentially switch or sign up for mobile services without having to be at a telecoms shop in person. The operator-agnostic SIM embedded in one’s mobile device could be activated over the air by any operator, and consumers will not need to keep swopping SIM cards, Ms Chia said. This is why IMDA is proposing to extend the current no SIM-lock policy, which does not allow any mobile operator to lock devices imported to and sold in Singapore to a particular operator, to eSIMs, the agency said. “Given developments in eSIM technology, eSIMs will increasingly be used in mobile phones, tablets and wearables, amongst others,” IMDA said in its press release. “The policy remains relevant to encourage competition and provide consumers with the freedom to choose and switch between mobile operators without changing their devices.” That said, eSIM technology is still “nascent” today, Ms Chia pointed out, and this public consultation is meant to pave the way for when it hits mainstream use. There are not many eSIM-enabled devices in the market currently, with the LTE-enabled Apple Watch, Google’s Pixel 2 smartphones and Microsoft’s Surface Pro among them.   More launches of such devices are expected though, with industry body Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) saying eSIMs will make it easier to extend mobile connectivity to devices such as tablets, smart watches, fitness bands and portable health systems.  BOON FOR BUSINESSES?  While the benefits for consumers are there, eSIM technology could potentially have a greater impact on businesses - particularly for those with large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) or machine-to-machine (M2M) deployments such as in logistics or utilities. Ms Chia pointed to an example of a business with a fleet of vehicles to manage.  Currently, these IoT-enabled vehicles would have SIM cards in them, and they may be soldered in, which makes switching operators almost an untenable choice, as they will have to swap out the physical SIM cards, she told Channel NewsAsia. Such a scenario could be prevented with eSIMs, as the service activation by the new telco provider can be done over the air, she explained. As part of the public consultation, IMDA is proposing to maintain the current licensing framework for M2M only for devices that support mobility and/or come with restricted voice communication features for public safety reasons.  For other IoT or M2M devices, the regulator is looking at a “light-touch” licensing approach where the device manufacturer, importer and seller are required to just register the device and obtain a Telecommunication Dealer’s (Class) licence. They will not be required to keep subscription-related information such as SIM card information, it added.  IMDA is also proposing that mobile operators and service providers adopt the GSMA specifications for eSIM-enabled devices, as well as ISO 27001 to protect against cyberattacks. The public consultation will close on Jul 18, the agency said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/switch-mobile-operator-without-changing-sim-cards-imda-wants-10395682"}, {"datetime": "06 Jun 2018 11:06AM", "tags": ["ComfortDelGro", "taxi", "Uber"], "author": "", "title": "ComfortDelGro witnessing 'uptick' in bookings for taxis", "content": " SINGAPORE: ComfortDelGro has seen an \"uptick\" in bookings made through its call centre and phone app for its taxis in the first five months of 2018, it announced on Wednesday (Jun 6).  The taxi operator said that bookings increased by almost 9 per cent year-on-year in May 2018, which is the biggest year-on-year jump since September 2014.  The turnaround in bookings has come on the back of Uber's exit from the region, said ComfortDelGro.

Another laudable aspect of the blueprint is its focus on inclusivity, to help ensure that no pocket of the population is left behind in our push towards digitalisation. The blueprint covers various key dimensions including equipping everyone with a set of basic digital skills for performing everyday activities, and sharpening the focus on information and media literacy to develop resilience in the face of proliferating online disinformation.  It also factors in the crucial design dimension that seeks to leverage user-friendly and human-centric innovations that can help ramp up adoption of digital services. WRONG SIDE OF DIGITAL SKILLS DIVIDE The term “readiness” is itself a sound choice as it accommodates the fact that we will all venture into the digitalised world from different departure points. Those who live and breathe technology will clearly need to be supported in rather more sophisticated ways than those whose foundational digital skills require concerted enhancement.  Hence the blueprint’s recommendation to provide one-on-one concierge-type services for addressing Singaporeans’ day-to-day digital queries is also commendable. Indeed, even as we congratulate ourselves for being one of the most connected countries in the world, we must nevertheless be cognisant of those among us who are on the wrong side of the digital skills divide. In exploratory research I conducted in 2015 and 2016 on underprivileged youths from low-income families residing in rental flats, I noted some interesting characteristics of their internet use.  Eschewing laptop and desktop computers in favour of smartphones, these young people’s internet use was largely confined to social media and communication apps such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram, as well as entertainment apps such as YouTube, Dubsmash and Musical.ly, with minimal exploration of the World Wide Web’s other rich offerings. For all intents and purposes, even as statistical measures would classify these youths as internet users, their limited navigation and usage of the online space did not fully optimise the medium’s vast range of affordances. For example, they may not be conscious of the avenues for curating an online presence that enables them to advertise their skills so that they can heighten their employability. Similarly, they may be less aware of opportunities to take online courses that could help them upgrade their skills.  Despite being internet users therefore, their limited repertoire of internet skills thus constitute a form of what I would term an “invisible illiteracy” that is not captured by conventional data on internet and technology use. 'WALLED GARDENS' Furthermore, the app-centric and socially-oriented nature of their internet use meant that a great deal of the information they consumed emerged from within “walled gardens” and was largely mediated by their peer groups. Given the customisable nature of internet use today, where algorithms within apps simply serve up more of the content that you already express an interest in, there is a diminished likelihood of encountering information outside the realm of your interest. Similarly, if one’s information is mediated largely by one’s peers, the chances of being exposed to perspectives that diverge from those within your social circles are also reduced. Without consciousness of these aspects of the digital infosphere, the average media consumer may find his or her media diet becoming less varied over time. This can obviously impede the benefits one can effectively reap from the digitalised world, and undermine one’s ability to participate more fully in it. DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF INVISIBLE ILLITERACIES How then do we address these invisible illiteracies and what other forms of such illiteracies may we be losing sight of? For instance, are the seemingly digitally savvy among us lacking an appreciation of the psychological biases that compromise our ability to consume information more critically? Hence, we need a firmer grasp of internet usage trends in Singapore and how internet skills vary across different segments of the population. Importantly, what percentage of our internet users are mobile-first (using a range of devices to access the internet but preferring mobile devices) and what percentage are mobile-only (accessing the internet exclusively using the mobile phone or tablets)? Do different means of accessing the internet translate into different kinds of digital competencies but also challenges and if so, to what extent? What kinds of design priorities must be borne in mind when catering to mobile-only versus mobile-first users? How do variations in technology use and exposure influence people’s abilities to adapt to increasingly digitalised learning spaces and workplaces? TARGETED RESEARCH NEEDED​​​​​​​ Beyond the ground efforts at public education that the Digital Readiness Blueprint has spelt out therefore, it is critical that comprehensive yet targeted research efforts be supported and undertaken to strategically chart the transformations in our increasingly connected society.  Such research should also utilise a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches so that nationally representative data is complemented by richly-contextualised and in-depth insights into Singaporean’s digital experiences in the key realms of their everyday lives. With digital readiness as the goal, the blueprint to chart our directions, and robust research to illuminate the path, we can strive to boost digital competencies and to identify any invisible illiteracies that undermine Singaporeans' abilities to participate fully in the country’s digitalised future.

It is available at the Harmony Nasi Lemak eatery, part of OSG Bar + Kitchen at Suntec City. “To our limited knowledge, the US is protective of the beef trade. So we want to make Trump feel good because we are using American beef,” noted Mr Wen. “Food also has to be harmonised. Nasi lemak has achar (pickled vegetables), so we replaced the achar with kimchi – to create that balance.” Harmony is not alone in creating a summit-themed dish as interest in the summit intensifies. Mexican restaurant and bar Lucha Loco has also got in on the act, offering El Trumpo (Cheeseburger) and Rocket Man (Korean Fried Chicken) tacos. “I don’t think a summit of this scale has ever been held in Singapore where you have two controversial leaders, so we wanted to just inject a bit of fun and lightheartedness,” said group marketing manager Leon Foong. The tacos are available from Jun 4 to 16 and are priced at S$10 each. Each taco purchased qualifies customers for a Friday and Saturday night draw where they get the opportunity to smash custom-made Trump-Kim piñatas. “We’ve always liked to poke fun – we’re very much a fun restaurant. For us, it’s about producing satire, being tongue-in-cheek,” added Mr Foong. “This is a bit of a poke but it’s all in the nature of having a good laugh.” At local bar Hopheads, a pair of drinks consisting of Asahi beer, diet Coke, Tequila and white grape soju nicknamed Bromance is their ode to the Singapore summit. “We’re quite a young and trendy place, so we thought that this could be interesting and relevant,” said floor manager Carlo Ibanez. The set, which costs S$19, comes complete with stickers of Trump and Kim puckering their lips. Hotels too are getting involved.  Down the road from the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore - which has been also been designated as a special event area for the summit - Royal Plaza on Scotts is including in its menu a Trump-Kim Burger and Summit Iced Tea. Available from Jun 8 to 15, the grilled Trump-Kim Burger is made up of minced chicken and kimchi patty, seaweed, with Korean rice rolls and fries. Customers can also wash down their meal with a Summit Iced Tea, specially concocted by infusing iconic Korean flavour honey yuzu into traditional iced tea.  In commemoration of the summit on Jun 12, the burger is priced at S$12 and the iced tea at S$6. According to Mr Wen, Harmony has experienced a 10 per cent uptick in business since they launched their new nasi lemak on Monday. “The response has been quite positive, although the pricing is considered quite expensive for a nasi lemak,” Mr Wen said. Mr Foong too has seen increased demand for the tacos, just one day after its launch.  “People are already asking about the tacos even during lunch today. As we get closer to the summit, we’ll see more people coming in,” he said. “So far, it has been quite balanced. People order two to try and share.

The decision by Dortmund-based Dr Peters Group deals a fresh blow to the planemaker's efforts to maintain market interest in the double-decker, barely 10 years after it went into service hailed by heads of state as a symbol of European ambition. \"Psychologically it is not good for Airbus, but this is a very large aircraft with a very small second-hand market,\" said UK-based aerospace analyst Howard Wheeldon. Despite strong reviews for its quiet and spacious cabin, demand for the 544-seater has fallen as many airlines drop the industry's largest four-engined aircraft in favour of smaller twin-engined ones that are more efficient, and easier to fill. \"It's too big. There was a battle for airline fashions and it lost out,\" Wheeldon said. Airbus says the iconic jet will eventually prove itself as travel demand saturates airport capacity at major cities. \"We can’t comment on the decision by Dr Peters, which is the owner of the aircraft,\" an Airbus spokesman said. \"We remain confident in the secondary market for the A380 and the potential to extend the operator base.\" Singapore Airlines launched A380 services amid fanfare in December 2007, but returned the first two aircraft to their German financiers when leases expired about 10 years later. The two discarded aircraft were repainted and flown to Tarbes in the French Pyrenees to be stored, and since then their fate has been uncertain as their owner looked for other takers. \"After extensive as well as intensive negotiations with various airlines such as British Airways, HiFly and IranAir, Dr Peters Group has decided to sell the aircraft components and will recommend this approach to its investors,\" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. Airbus has been working for months to try to stimulate a second-hand market for the A380 to encourage new airlines to take the risk of investing in the plane, knowing the asset would be worth the right amount when they decide to sell it on. When it was launched, the A380 boasted highly customised interiors to help airlines promote a luxury feel, but the cost of replacing such bespoke fittings is now seen as a handicap. \"The problem is the cost of reconfiguration. It is US$40 million or more per plane,\" a senior industry source said. PARTS RAID The planes will not be scrapped entirely, but their huge frames will be combed for valuable components such as landing gears and electronics, a Dr Peters official told Reuters. Their engines have already been removed and leased back to manufacturer Rolls-Royce for use as spares. US-based VAS Aero Services will be responsible for extracting and selling parts. Dr Peters said the deal would yield a positive return for investors in funds used to finance the jets. It operates a number of boutique funds targeted at wealthy individuals and has two more A380s in Singapore that could face the same fate. While dismantling the first two passenger-carrying A380s will embarrass Airbus and dismay the plane's 3,800 workers, later examples of the flagship jet may not be as vulnerable. Early copies of a new plane tend to be less efficient and Singapore Airlines recently ordered some new A380s. However, overall demand is thinner than Airbus expected, forcing it to slow production to a trickle while looking for more business. Still, Emirates, the largest A380 customer, is keeping faith with the jet which brings millions of passengers a year through its Dubai hub and is associated with the airline's global brand. Throwing the loss-making programme a lifeline for a decade, Emirates recently ordered up to 36 more A380s and set out plans on Tuesday to install 56 Premium Economy seats.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/a-decade-after-debut-first-a380-jumbos-to-be-broken-up-10389260"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 08:30PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un"], "author": "Brandon Tanoto", "title": "More than 2,500 media registrations received for Trump-Kim summit in Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: The global spotlight will be on Singapore next week as it hosts what would be a historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North leader Kim Jong Un.  More than 2,500 people from local and international media are expected to cover the event here, according to the number of registrations received by the Ministry of Communications and Information as of Tuesday (Jun 5).

But there remain challenges.  One of which is figuring out the right regulatory structure and avoiding possible downsides given the lack of prior experiences and success models, said Dr Puthucheary in response to a question posed during a panel discussion at the Smart Nation Innovations Week opening symposium.  To help with that, the Government has since taken on the approach of a “regulatory sandbox” which has found success in industries, such as financial technology (FinTech) monitored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  This idea of creating a safe space for experimentation will be applied to other domains where uncertainties remain about the appropriate regulatory structure to drive innovation, he added.  The second challenge, according to Dr Puthucheary, is how digital transformation initiatives remain a “hard sell” to Singaporeans amid fears about job losses and privacy, as well as how a significant portion of the local population are not English-educated or digital natives.  All these add to the challenge of convincing Singaporeans that the transformation will be beneficial.  “There is anxiety about how much value this is to them,” said Dr Puthucheary.  This is where the country’s first Digital Readiness Blueprint comes in. In response to a question from Channel NewsAsia during a group interview after the opening symposium, Dr Puthucheary said: “That looks at issues around access, literacy and participation – how do we give Singaporeans increasing access to the benefits of the digital revolution and how do we make sure they have literacy … and skills needed to participate in the online space.”  Efforts are also underway to help workers navigate disruption of technology on jobs – an issue that “is not something to shy away from” given how it has “very real” concerns, he said.  For example, the Labour Movement is committed to re-training and re-skilling the local workforce while education institutions here are ensuring that students are well-prepared for opportunities in the current world.  “Social acceptance of our digital initiatives is very important because ultimately, what we do has to translate to benefits for Singaporeans … Some of these things are happening at such a rapid pace, it means that people have to learn new skills and that is an anxiety for anybody,” said Dr Puthucheary.  “If we can get all that right, then Singaporeans will see that there are a lot of benefits to this journey of transformation through technology that we are using Smart Nation for,” he added. DATA “IS THE NEW AIR” Alongside Dr Puthucheary, other speakers for the two panel discussions held at the Marina Bay Sands include DBS CEO Piyush Gupta and Michaelia Cash, Australia’s Minister for jobs and innovation, who weighed in on how technology is transforming people’s lives, cities and economies.  The increasing importance of data and the recent rise in privacy concerns were among the issues tossed up during the discussions.  For instance, data has had profound implications on the banking sector by changing how things work and allowing everyone, ranging from start-ups to big tech oligarchs, to dip their toes into the industry, said Mr Gupta.  “Data is a big thing,” he said. “People call data the new oil. I think data is more than the new oil; it is the new air.”  However, this comes with both upsides and downsides. While digital technology has paved the way for financial inclusion, it also has unintended consequences on areas like jobs, added Mr Gupta.  Citing DBS as an example where the use of technology has allowed it reduce the number of employees at its bank branches and call centres by half, the chief of Singapore’s biggest lender said: “We have been automating and digitising … but what does that mean to the nature of jobs? What does it mean to where the jobs come from?”  Ms Harriet Green, chairman and CEO of IBM Asia-Pacific, said the issue of data stewardship is at the heart of digitisation, be it for governments or businesses.  Noting that 80 per cent of the world’s data currently belongs to companies and is not searchable, she added: “With a greater power (comes) a deep responsibility around stewarding and being the guardians of the data of our clients and of the people that give us that data.”  On the issue of privacy fears, Dr Puthucheary said putting in place the right type of protection will be appropriate, such as making sure that citizens have the “recourse to either appeal, challenge or to secure their privacy”.  However, this should be done in a way that does not constrain business opportunities.  “The opportunities that will be available through the analysis of data are likely to increase and we must make sure that we all benefit from that process,” he said.  “There is some clear anxiety given what has happened recently and it’s appropriate that we correct and put in place the right type of protection. But I think we also want to give ourselves the opportunity to think about how … not to constrain the business model and business opportunities.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/social-acceptance-forming-right-regulations-are-challenges-to-10384920"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 03:00PM", "tags": ["crime", "China officials impersonation scam"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "2 Malaysians arrested in China officials impersonation scam syndicate; S$590,000 seized", "content": " SINGAPORE: Two Malaysian men have been arrested for their suspected involvement in a series of China officials impersonation scams, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) announced at a press conference on Tuesday (Jun 5).  The two suspects – aged 18 and 33 – were nabbed by police on Monday after a raid at Ubi Avenue 1 and cash amounting to S$590,000 was seized.  It is the largest cash amount seized in scam this year, the police said.   The pair, who are believed to be involved in several cases, allegedly cheated two women earlier this month of S$410,000 in total.  Police said they received reports on Jun 1 and Jun 2 that the women - aged 51 and 55 - had received calls from strangers who claimed to be police officials from China.  The callers told the women that they were involved in a transnational money laundering crime and instructed them to withdraw all their savings for investigations.  The 51-year-old woman then transferred S$100,000 to a bank account while the 55-year-old woman handed over S$310,000 to an unknown man, police said. Preliminary investigations revealed that the two suspects had received money linked to China officials impersonation scams and are believed to be involved in other similar cases. The men will be charged with dishonestly receiving stolen property on Wednesday. If convicted, each of them could be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both.  The 33-year-old was in Singapore on a social visit pass while the 18-year-old is a permanent resident. They will be remanded in custody and investigations are ongoing.  Another suspect who was also involved in the case, 18-year-old Malaysian national Chan Wai Chung, was charged in court last Saturday under the similar offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property.  At the press conference, Director for SPF’s commercial affairs department David Chew stressed that such scams are a “serious crime concern”.  “The number of victims has more than doubled from January to April 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 and the losses suffered by the victims per case can be sizable,” he said.  Mr Chew also advised members of the public that if they receive calls from people claiming to be a foreign government official demanding money, they are advised to ignore such demands as they are “in all likelihood” a scam.  Last month, a 31-year-old Malaysian man was arrested for allegedly cheating a woman of S$5.4 million. According to police, the woman was led to believe that she had to surrender all her money to Chinese authorities to assist in investigations.  In a separate case in May, a 20-year-old Taiwanese man was also nabbed for cheating a man of S$14,600 by claiming to be from the Chinese police.   Police would like to advise members of the public to take precautions when they receive unsolicited calls to surrender money.

Kabir Md Alamgir, 45, was captured on CCTV footage at the swimming complex on Oct 9, 2016. He was rinsing and cleaning his mouth repeatedly at a sink outside the male toilet. The victim had entered the toilet to take a shower after his weekly swimming lesson ended at 5.30pm, the court heard. The boy cannot be named due to a gag order. The victim had locked the toilet cubicle’s door when he went in to shower. Kabir knocked on the door and told the boy he had left his key inside. The door was loosely latched, the court heard, and Kabir managed to enter the cubicle without the victim unlocking it. Kabir claimed he could not find the key. He then decided to “have some fun” with the victim, court documents said. He performed oral sex on the boy, who asked him to stop as he was afraid. It was only when the teen said his father was here to pick him up that Kabir stopped. The incident lasted two to three minutes. The court heard that Kabir found the victim to have a good physique and paid particular attention to him as they were always at the swimming complex at the same time.  After Kabir left, the victim cleaned himself thoroughly as he found Kabir’s actions to be “gross and disgusting”, according to court documents. Kabir left the complex without swimming. When the victim got into his father’s car, he told his family that “a crazy man” had performed oral sex on him and began to cry. His father went to the complex to look for Kabir, but could not find him and took the victim home. The teen and his father lodged a police report the same day. Kabir was arrested the next day. KABIR SPOKE TO VICTIM MONTHS BEFORE INCIDENT The court heard that seven to eight months before the offence, Kabir had initiated a conversation with the victim while they were in the toilet. Kabir, who had been working in Singapore for 19 years, asked the victim how he was, his name and which school he was from. The victim said he responded out of politeness. The victim also told Kabir that he would go to the complex for swimming lessons every Sunday from 4.30pm to 5.30pm. Kabir spoke to the victim at least two other times, according to court documents.  The victim recalled that Kabir was bare-chested each time. Aside from the victim and the lifeguard, Kabir did not speak with anyone else as other boys never spoke to him, court documents said. The conversations between Kabir and the victim took place at a bench outside the shower cubicles within the male toilet. For sexually assaulting the victim, Kabir faces up to 20 years’ jail, as well as a fine or caning. One other charge of using criminal force with intent to outage modesty was taken into consideration. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/toa-payoh-swimming-complex-bangladeshi-sexual-assault-10382546"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 01:11PM", "tags": ["OCBC", "MyInfo", "Smart Nation"], "author": "", "title": "OCBC rolls out instant digital account-opening service", "content": " SINGAPORE: OCBC Bank on Tuesday (Jun 5) announced that it has rolled out a digital account-opening service which leverages national data repository MyInfo.  The new service will allow customers who are Singaporeans or permanent residents to instantly open an account without having to visit a bank branch or provide documents, said the bank in a media release.  Simply by using a mobile device or desktop, individuals - even if they do not have any relationship with the bank - can open an OCBC 360 Account via the bank's website in less than five minutes, it said.  Customers first have to submit an application by simply logging in with their SingPass details.  An online OCBC 360 Account application form would have already been pre-filled using the MyInfo service, not requiring customers to key in additional details or submit documents.  This is followed by verification using the bank's digitised KYC process or \"know your customer\", where customers are verified real-time and granted approval instantly.  Previously customers had to wait for their accounts to be checked by staff, said the bank.  \"Our ambition is to have one in every two customers on-boarded digitally with zero human intervention,\" said Mr Aditya Gupta, OCBC Bank's head of E-Business Singapore.  \"We will be extending this service to a broader suite of our products shortly,\" he added.  As part of Singapore's move towards a Smart Nation, MyInfo, which was first launched in 2016, compiles personal information such as NRIC numbers, income and CPF data from difference public agencies.

Mufidah said she’ll be nervous “like everyone else”, but is confident the hours of practice she’s put in will ensure she doesn’t “get it wrong”. The performance will also include the Combined Schools Choir, a crowd favourite that is returning after a five-year hiatus. The choir will perform before the entrances of the Prime Minister and then the President, and features 220 students from various secondary schools. “The students have been practising hard to make sure they’ll deliver a wonderful performance,” SLTC Chiong said. Also among the military tattoo performance participants are 18 students from special education schools to make the performance “more inclusive”, SLTC Chiong said. In all, the performance will feature celebratory elements like the 21-Gun Presidential Gun Salute, the Feu De Joie and the State Flag flypast flown by a Chinook helicopter escorted by two AH-64D Apache attack helicopters. ENHANCED AERIAL DISPLAY To commemorate the Republic of Singapore Airforce’s (RSAF) 50th birthday, this year’s “enhanced aerial segment” will involve up to 21 RSAF aircraft. “This year’s aerial display will comprise an impressive aerial flypast followed by a dynamic aerial performance,” SLTC Chiong said. The planes will fly in formation towards the Float before fighter jets execute aerial aerobatics over the Marina Bay skies. Against the backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands, an RSAF50 special livery F-15SG will pull off a high-G turn. “We don’t do this day in, day out, so we have to start flying close to one another and progressively go to a lower altitude to make sure you are proficient,” F-16 pilot Captain Matthew Foo, 35, said of the rehearsals. SIZEABLE TURN-OUT More than 2,600 participants, one of the largest ever turn-outs, will participate in this year’s NDP, organisers said. Parade regimental sergeant major Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Tay Ban Heng, 44, said he’s had to look after the safety of his Malay participants as rehearsals take place during the Ramadan fasting period. “This period is also the World Cup period and I really need to warn my participants not to be watching the matches so they can be more focused and come for my rehearsals,” he added. MWO Tay, a veteran Guardsman, might cut a stern figure, but there’s a softer side to him when it comes to not losing his voice throughout the numerous rehearsals of shouting commands. “I would like to thank my wife because she has been preparing honey lemon drinks for me every rehearsal,” he said with a smile. “Hopefully I can sustain my voice until the actual day.” Singaporeans are encouraged to tag their NDP 2018 social media posts with the hashtags #WeAreSingapore, #NDP2018 and #NDP18.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-day-parade-2018-largest-performance-aerial-display-10382964"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 01:00PM", "tags": ["Autonomous shuttles", "Sentosa", "Ministry of Transport", "ST Engineering"], "author": "", "title": "Sentosa testing autonomous shuttle; public trial to begin in 2019", "content": " SINGAPORE: From next year, there will be another option to get around in Sentosa - autonomous shuttles.  Visitors and staff can hail them via smartphones or at kiosks along a 5km route on the island when they are put on a three-month trial in 2019, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT), Sentosa Development and ST Engineering in a joint-release on Tuesday (Jun 5).

These initiatives were announced by Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran at the opening of Innovfest Unbound on Tuesday (Jun 5). The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) said separately in a press release that it is speaking to key stakeholders – including the Government, industry, consumers and academia – to collaboratively shape plans for the AI ecosystem. This discourse, it said, will support the country’s plans to be a hub for AI development and innovation and effectively respond to global developments. Mr Yeong Zee Kin, assistant chief executive of Data Innovation and Protection, was keen to point out that \"a lot of AI is commonly used in process automation\", such as fraud detection. \"(On the other hand,) narrow or specific AI is what consumers interact with in voice recognition and recommendation engines,\" he told Channel NewsAsia.    This is why there is a need to have a common language to talk about AI technology.  There are three related initiatives to shape Singapore's AI industry: Set up the Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data A research programme on the governance of AI and data use to advance and inform scholarly research on AI governance issues A discussion paper released by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) on responsible development and adoption of AI, which will be used by the council to frame its deliberations IMDA said Mr Iswaran will appoint the members of the advisory council which will be chaired by former attorney-general V K Rajah. Members will include private sector thought leaders in AI and big data from local and international companies as well as consumer interest representatives. More details on the council will be released at a later date, IMDA said. The council will advise and work with the agency in the areas of responsible development and deployment of AI. These include engaging stakeholders such as ethics boards of commercial enterprises on the issues arising from the use of AI and data by the private sector, and consumer advocates on people's expectations and acceptance of such use, it said. INSPIRING CONFIDENCE IN AI USE The council will also help establish a legal and technical expert panel as well as a panel of international experts for global perspectives to aid it in its work, the press release said. One example of what the council could look into is an online shopping platform using AI to recommend products to shoppers, an IMDA spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia. These recommendations are shown automatically on every product page to allow easy browsing and navigation, with the aim of increasing click-through and customer engagement rates. “The council could look at issues such as how to explain to users that their shopping patterns are what forms related product recommendations from the AI, as well as how the AI aggregates data from all customers who have visited a particular product page to offer its alternate recommendations,” he explained. “The AI’s modelling should also be clear to users in how it detects, for example, the price range of products it offers to users as well.” Another example cited was Luminance – an AI platform used by the legal profession for work in areas such as insurance or contract management and to conduct due diligence and compliance checks. With this, law firms can offer multiple options and tiers to clients not possible before, such as the cheapest option of having the AI technology conduct the due diligence completely or a mid-tier level that would mean a team of lawyers checking the AI’s results, the spokesperson pointed out. The advisory council could look at how the product can be transparent, fair and explained to end users, he added. “A product such as Luminance (explained) clearly to clients helps them understand the benefits and risks of using the product, and enables law firms to offer a tiered approach to a service which traditionally only had one cost level,” explained the IMDA spokesperson. Salesforce chief scientist Richard Socher told Channel NewsAsia in an interview on the sidelines of Innovfest Unbound that setting up the advisory council is \"very sensible\" on the part of the Singapore Government.  That said, there is a need for sub-committees within the main council to look at how AI can be used in specific verticals such as recruitment within human resources, as there could be \"existing biases\", he added. Citing the example of healthcare training and AI, Mr Socher said: \"The data to be included in the machine learning algorithm needs to be inclusive and have data from minorities.\" Otherwise, the results derived would be skewed towards a certain race or ethnicity, he explained.  BEING AI THOUGHT LEADERS The PDPC, meanwhile, is putting forward a discussion paper on how a possible reference AI and data governance framework for industries could look like. It recommends two key principles: Decisions made by or with the assistance of AI should be explainable, transparent and fair to consumers AI systems, robots and decisions should be human-centric IMDA said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is an early collaborator in creating the discussion paper, with its Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency Committee using the document to help shape its ongoing discussion on the use of AI and data analytics in the financial industry. Last, but not least, there will be a five-year research programme on the governance of AI and data use, which will be set up at the Singapore Management University. SMU was awarded an S$4.5 million grant from the National Research Foundation and the IMDA to helm the programme. SMU School of Law will also set up a new research centre as part of this initiative. The research and thought leadership generated from the programme will support the advisory council and inform Government and industry discussion on the technology. These AI-related initiatives come as the Digital Government Blueprint was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on the same day. Within the document is a set of key performance indicators for the public sector to aim for by 2023, and these include having all ministries and its related agencies to have at least one AI project by then. Asked what types of Government service have used AI, a Smart Nation and Digital Government Office spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia separately that an example is virtual assistant Ask Jamie. The chatbot uses its natural language processing engine to understand users’ questions and respond with an appropriate answer, he explained. The blueprint also said the Government will develop a set of guidelines on the use of AI to manage the risk, and the spokesperson said SNDGO is currently reviewing the guidelines and “will share more details when ready”.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/new-council-to-advise-singapore-government-on-ethical-use-of-ai-10370190"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 10:56AM", "tags": ["North Korea", "Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore launches 'World Peace' medallion to mark US-North Korea summit", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Mint has launched commemorative medallions carrying the inscription \"World Peace\" ahead of the highly anticipated summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The three medallions would not only commemorate the \"momentous step to world peace\", but also mark Singapore's role \"as a neutral host, and an economic and security gateway between the East and the West\", the Singapore Mint said in a press release on Tuesday (Jun 5).  The front of the medallion features a handshake between the two leaders and the national flags of both countries.   The North Korean flag is depicted on the left, while the US flag is placed on the right. This represents both countries' positions on the political spectrum, explained the Singapore Mint. The summit date and text \"Summit in Singapore\" are also minted at the top of the medallion.  The back of the medallion features a peace dove \"which embodies the significance of the summit to bring about world peace\", said the Singapore Mint.  The national flowers of US and North Korea - the rose and the magnolia - are also featured on the back.  A total of 1,000 pieces of the gold medallion – priced at S$1,380 each – will be made available to Singapore and the international market. This has since been increased to 3,000 pieces following \"overwhelming response\", the Singapore Mint said.  The silver medallion - which features the flags in colour – is priced at S$118. A total of 15,000 pieces worldwide will be minted, up from the earlier announced 10,000 pieces. The Singapore Mint said earlier that fewer than 200 pieces of the gold medallion and 2,000 pieces of the silver medallion would be allocated to Singapore. The numbers are now under review, it said in an update on Tuesday.  The nickel-plated medallion will retail at S$36. The number of pieces to be minted will depend on the demand, Singapore Mint said. All three commemorative medallions are available for pre-order from Tuesday onwards at Singapore Mint's retail outlets and website. The White House last month unveiled their own commemorative coin for the summit. It is available for purchase online at the White House gift shop website.  The meeting between the two leaders will be the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. After a war of words that lasted months, it aims to start a discussion on ending the North's nuclear weapons programme in return for diplomatic and economic incentives. The White House announced on Wednesday morning (Jun 6) that the meeting will be held at the Capella Hotel. Singapore has declared special event zones ahead of the summit, including Sentosa island, as well as the area around the Shangri-La hotel. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coins-us-north-korea-summit-medallions-singapore-mint-10380918"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 10:28AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Music", "NDP", "National Day"], "author": "Khoo Bee Khim", "title": "Who is Charlie Lim? He's a regular eastside boy with a 'nerdy' Roxy Square past", "content": " Follow our new CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: “I was dog-sitting last night and there was a thunderstorm,” said a visibly tired Charlie Lim before settling down for the interview with CNA Lifestyle. “I couldn’t get much sleep,” he said. The soft-spoken 29-year-old singer-songwriter didn't let on much but from his Instagram Stories, the cause of his sleep deprivation was an adorable but thunder-spooked Jack Russell named Sparky that kept him up with his barking till past 4am.  Lim looked like he could do with a caffeine fix – maybe one from Chin Mee Chin Confectionery in Katong, which this eastside boy grew up with. \"The old aunties have been working there for a really long time, and everyone is very cute,\" he said. \"There is a nice vibe to it. My usual order would be a kaya toast and teh siew dai,\" he said. Growing up in the east meant that Lim's childhood haunts centred around Marine Parade, Parkway Parade, Katong and Joo Chiat. \"I was a nerd growing up, so on a typical weekend, I would be playing LAN games at Roxy Square. There were heaps of cyber cafes there then. I would play Counter Strike after school and after church. I used to play lots of games, I remember!\" he chuckled.  SINGAPOREANS BEHIND THE SONG In the unlikely event that you haven't already heard, Lim has updated the 1987 classic We Are Singapore to create this year's National Day Parade (NDP) theme song. Produced by Lim, Evan Low (Evanturetime) and NDP music director Dr Sydney Tan – whom Lim credits as his mentor – the song kicks off with two new verses before segueing into the familiar tune that was originally written by Hugh Harrison. Lending vocals to the song are Lim, along with Joanna Dong, Shak’thiya (Shak), Aisyah Aziz, Vanessa Fernandez (Vandetta) and Kevin Lester (The Lion City Boy).   Wrote a new preface and co-produced this year’s National Day theme, it’s been a real privilege working alongside a great crew pushing things forward. I’m getting asked this a lot - so my hope for what this song would do is just to encourage more open mindedness and positive discourse amongst ourselves, patience in dealing with our problems, and taking ownership of what we’ve got...it’s our home and we’re family after all ❤️🇸🇬 A post shared by  Charlie Lim (@wherewascharlie) on May 22, 2018 at 3:14am PDT  \"I gave it a shot when Dr Tan sent out an open call to songwriters to come up with an introduction to We Are Singapore,\" recalled Lim. \"I recorded a demo in my bedroom studio, and sent it over.\" \"I didn’t feel pressured,\" he added. \"I was just going to write it and if the NDP committee liked it, great. If not, I’m not gonna compromise anything because this is how I feel. I’m proud of it and if it suits the purpose of what they were trying to do, great. If not, no worries. But, yay, it got picked.\" The pressure set in after his prelude was picked. \"I had to finish the tune now. Joining my preface with the rest of We Are Singapore, producing it, arranging it, and making it all sound coherent – that was tricky. It took about three months,\" he said. Incidentally, the song featured his vocals from his home-recorded demo. \"It sounded more honest, I guess, than the recording in the studio,\" he said. Streaming audiences are already familiar with the multi-instrumentalist's music, which ranges from folk rock to experimental pop. In 2015, his album Time/Space – his proudest achievement, to date – shot to the top of the iTunes Singapore chart within an hour, and his songs have received over 2.5 million plays on Spotify.  Had a chat with the good folks at @thevinylday about creative purpose and experience creating the TIME/SPACE record, stream the video at http://vinyloftheday.com/charlie-lim-album-time-space #vinyloftheday A post shared by  Charlie Lim (@wherewascharlie) on Oct 4, 2017 at 4:08am PDT  Success also followed outside the Internet. Lim performed to a sold-out crowd in June 2015 at the Esplanade Concert Hall as part of a triple bill with Inch Chua and The Great Spy Experiment. He was also the first Singaporean to sell-out two shows at the Mosaic Music Festival. That same year, Lim wrote two theme songs for the 28th Southeast Asian Games and performed his song Still for the games' closing ceremony.  A MUSIC JOURNEY FROM TAO NAN TO MELBOURNE Lim's considerable musical talents almost didn't get heard. \"As a kid, I did classical piano lessons, which I hated. But I learned to play by ear a lot and improvise. Then, I did two years at Victoria School, where I was with the school choir,\" said Lim, who finished his primary school education at Tao Nan School.   Making mixtapes since 1992 A post shared by  Charlie Lim (@wherewascharlie) on Oct 8, 2017 at 8:40pm PDT  \"It was so uncool to be in the choir. I dreaded going for practice. But halfway through, I realised it was pretty amazing to sing four-part harmony. I sang alto before my voice broke, then I sang tenor. And we did really well. We were at the Singapore Youth Festival and we came in second.\" If he felt sheepish telling friends that he sang in the choir, playing in a band had the opposite effect on Lim – even if it was a nameless band in church. \"It’s like the cool thing to do,\" he said. \"I probably felt the most alive and most switched on as a kid when I was learning how to lead the band and work with the dynamics of the band.\" Although Lim is based in Singapore (and flying his eastsider flag high), the musician occasionally travels to Melbourne where his parents live. Lim himself is no stranger to the city, having spent three years in Melbourne after Secondary 2 \"for my A levels equivalent\" and another four years at Monash University, where he obtained his degree in Music Performance.  In between, he returned to Singapore to serve National Service with the Singapore Armed Forces Music and Drama Company. \"I loved my experience there. You’re not just the performer – you have to do everything: Check the sound, be the roadie, and set up everything. You have to be self-sufficient,\" he recalled. Like every Singaporean, Lim missed his favourite local food while away in Australia, like chicken rice, prawn mee soup and nasi lemak. So much that he did what many Singaporeans do: Pack Prima paste in his suitcase. Never mind that he's \"terrible at cooking\". \"I tried,\" he said, smiling. \"But whether I was successful, that’s another question.\" NATIONAL DAY PARADE 2018 | Watch the parade live on channelnewsasia.com starting from 5.30pm on Aug 9.Our livestream is also available on twitter.com/channelnewsasia and facebook.com/channelnewsasia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/charlie-lim-ndp-singer-songwriter-we-are-singapore-10332912"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 10:08AM", "tags": ["People's Association", "World Cup", "football"], "author": "", "title": "Free World Cup screenings at 55 community clubs: People's Association", "content": " SINGAPORE: Football fans looking for places to gather and watch the 2018 World Cup matches will be able to do so at 55 community clubs across Singapore, the People's Association (PA) announced on Tuesday (Jun 5).  It will be partnering Singapore Pools, Singtel and StarHub to screen 64 matches 'live' at the community clubs for free, said PA.  This will be the third successive World Cup that matches will be screened at community clubs.  The opening match between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia on Jun 14 will be screened at 40 community clubs and Our Tampines Hub.

According to the Digital Government Blueprint released on Tuesday (Jun 5), the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) is working on a set of digital standards and design principles – called the Digital Service Standards - that will be published by the end of the year. It contains policies that public agencies have to comply with when planning, designing and implementing their online services, a spokesperson from the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) told Channel NewsAsia. Before this set of standards, the spokesperson pointed out there were already guidelines like the Web Interface Standards, which incorporates elements of best practices from other leading digital governments and aligns with existing industry standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. The latter is an international standard for making Web content more accessible to those with disabilities. The Digital Service Standards aims to “further raise the standards” for all Government e-services, and enable people to transact “easily regardless of which agency’s service they are using”. For instance, the new standards will require all services to use appropriately sized fonts and colours that aid visibility. “This will benefit vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the visually impaired,” the spokesperson explained.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/singapore-public-agencies-to-observe-new-design-standards-for-10370524"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 09:40AM", "tags": ["Smart Nation", "Digital Government Blueprint", "Teo Chee Hean", "e-payments", "digital signature"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "E-payment, digital signature options for all government services by 2023", "content": " SINGAPORE: A Digital Government Blueprint was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on Tuesday (Jun 5), and in it, a target to offer electronic payment and digital signature options for all Government services by 2023. Speaking at the Smart Nation Innovations Week opening symposium, Mr Teo said: “Our government services are also going through a major transformation to put our citizens at the centre. The objective is to make services intuitive and easy for all to use – in several languages, and even if we are less familiar with technology.” He added that Singapore’s Smart Nation vision will be powered by technology, but it is not an end in itself. “To achieve widespread use and benefits, the applications need to be seamless and intuitive to use, without the user needing to spend time to navigate the complex underlying technology,” said Mr Teo, who is in charge of the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group within the Prime Minister’s Office. BEING DIGITAL NOT THE END GOAL According to the blueprint, being “digital to the core” is about using data, connectivity and computing decisively to transform the way the Government serve citizens and businesses and the way it enables public officers to contribute fully. For citizens and business, this means they will find digital government services intuitive, easy to use and relevant to their needs, and complete these transactions in a paperless manner from start to finish without having to be there in person. They will also only need to give information or request for help once, as the relevant data or request will be shared with the right public agencies, and feel confident their information is secure. Public officers, too, will work in an environment where they can evolve and design better policies through the integrated use of data and digital technologies, connect and collaborate with other officers using digital means and access “high quality internal corporate services and processes”. The initiative to train public officers in data analytics and digital literacy had been mentioned by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry, who is also in charge of the Public Service Division, during the debate on President Halimah Yacob’s address at the opening of the second session of the 13th Parliament. KEY INDICATORS SPELT OUT Amid these, the Government will hold itself to a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to be achieved by 2023. The indicators are: The Government has already provided digital services such as the ability to file income tax digitally and accessing library resources without having to physically go down to one as examples. It now has to do so for other services, the document added. “A Smart Nation is about enabling our people and businesses to exploit the full potential of the new digital technologies to improve the lives of our people and provide more opportunities for our businesses,” said Mr Teo. Echoing that, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary said the Government is looking at ramping up digital initiatives that can have a “real world impact”.  Citing existing initiatives, such as the HDB resale portal and new licensing portal LicenceOne, that are already helping to boost efficiency and cost savings, he said: “What we want is a lot more of these. To go down each interaction and see how we can bring it together into a product, whether it’s an app, website or a service, and make sure it has a real world impact.”  Apart from the National Digital Identity (NDI) system, a good digital payment platform will be a \"critical enabler\" of such \"presence-less and paperless\" transactions, he added in an interview with reporters after the opening symposium. The launch of the Digital Government Blueprint comes on the heels of Singapore’s first Digital Readiness Blueprint unveiled over the weekend, with inclusivity a key thrust in the planned initiatives. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/e-payment-digital-signature-options-for-all-government-services-10368616"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 09:08AM", "tags": ["Deliveroo", "Food delivery", "foodpanda"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Deliveroo dishes out ‘opt-in’ feature for plastic cutlery in Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: Don’t need any disposable cutlery? You can now check that option when you make a food order on Deliveroo.  To mark World Environment Day on Tuesday (Jun 5), the British food delivery service has rolled out an “opt-in for cutlery” feature in Singapore, allowing customers to say no to plastic forks and spoons when they make orders on its app and website.  It will also dish out 100,000 straws made from corn starch to its restaurant partners for free on a first-come-first-served basis, as part of its plan to fire up the use of non-plastic packaging options for takeaway deliveries.  “As a company, we are determined to help contribute to efforts to reduce the amount of plastic we all use in society and deliver real, tangible changes that will help our environment,” said Deliveroo’s Singapore general manager Sid Shanker. At the moment, every order via Deliveroo comes with plastic cutlery supplied by the restaurants. The company said it has received feedback from customers “asking (it) to do more” to reduce plastic packaging.  “We are conscious of the environmental cost that comes with convenience, and we want to deliver food in the best way possible while reducing our impact on the environment,” it told Channel NewsAsia.  Citing a trial done in the United Arab Emirates, all of the restaurants involved used fewer cutlery, with 85 per cent noting a reduction of more than half. Similarly in the United Kingdom where the “opt-in” feature went live in February, 91 per cent of meals are now delivered without disposable cutlery.  With the feature extended to nine other markets including Singapore, Deliveroo said the reduction in plastic packaging will be “significant”. The food delivery company also told Channel NewsAsia that it will be procuring compostable drinking straws from Bali-based social enterprise Avani Eco. These non-plastic alternatives, manufactured from polylactic acid or more commonly known as corn starch, “give off none of the toxic chemicals associated with conventional plastic”, it added. By providing 100,000 of these straws for free as part of the launch, Deliveroo hopes to steer restaurants towards sustainable practices as it aims to make more eco-friendly packaging options available in all markets by the end of the year. For this, it will be working with manufacturers to develop “first-of-its kind sustainable packaging ideal for food delivery” and will have them “competitively priced against traditional plastic options” to encourage restaurants to make the switch.  INDIVIDUALS ALSO MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY A similar initiative allowing consumers to opt out of disposable cutlery is also available on foodpanda. Since its roll-out in January, more than 100,000 plastic-free orders have been made in Singapore and the food delivery firm estimates that it could save up to over a million sets of cutleries by the end of 2018. The success in Singapore has also prompted the company to roll out the feature in other Asia-Pacific markets, such as Hong Kong and Thailand.  “We will be continuing in our sustainability mission and are currently exploring fully biodegradable packaging to roll out globally,” said Mr Luc Andreani, managing director of foodpanda in Singapore.  The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) said it welcomes any initiatives by companies to reduce the excessive use of single-use plastic. While food delivery services are not solely to blame, SEC’s executive director Jen Teo said a busy lifestyle and the readily available takeaway food choices have combined to increase the amount of food packaging waste generated by Singaporeans.  The SEC has also observed a shift away from paper packaging towards plastic containers and bags. Even as it applauded the move and acknowledged that companies can do more, Ms Teo stressed that individuals also have the responsibility to proactively reduce waste.  “Each of us can make daily choices to help minimise food packaging waste,” she said. “For example, we can decline to take disposable cutlery and straws if we are having a meal at home or in the office. Or we can bring our own reusable cups and cutlery when dining out.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/deliveroo-dishes-out-opt-in-feature-for-plastic-cutlery-in-10368690"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 09:08AM", "tags": ["Trending"], "author": "", "title": "SAM Late Nights returns with live music, an exploration of time, and craft beer", "content": " Follow our CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos.

It’s a big step from just five years ago, when there was no industry to speak of, and only 20 space researchers in institutes of higher learning.  Curiously, 2013 was also when the Economic Development Board (EDB) started its Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn), focusing on developing the sector, even amidst the apparent dearth of commercial projects. But the agency saw a number of factors that led it to believe that space technology could be an exciting part of Singapore’s economic landscape. One is that space technology has become much cheaper over the past decade, making it accessible to small players and even start-ups. This is thanks to advances in technology, leading to miniaturisation. In fact, some of the smallest satellites are cubes that measure just 10cm on each side – known as nanosatellites. While traditional satellites could cost US$100 million (S$133 million) to build, these nanosatellites can be built by undergraduates at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) at a cost of only US$50,000. Launching a nanosatellite costs as little as US$70,000 to US$80,000, compared to US$40 million to US$50 million for traditional satellites. This accessibility has led industry players to dub our time the \"new space age\". Associate Professor Amal Chandran, assistant director of the Satellite Research Centre housed in NTU, compared the developments to that in mobile technology. “Payloads have become very smart. We have started to miniaturise it to be able to fit within these (nanosatellites) and execute full space missions,” said Dr Chandran, who is referring to devices carried by the satellites, ranging from scientific instruments, cameras to sensors. SINGAPORE’S CAPABILITIES Another factor that EDB identified was the fact that Singaporean businesses have latent capabilities in other fields, which are transferable to space technology. “We already had good capabilities in electronics, in info-communications and technology,” said Mr Tan Kong Hwee, executive director of transport engineering in EDB, the division that oversees OSTIn. “It was a great opportunity for us to leverage those capabilities to look into how else we could expand our industry riding on this trend.” An example of a company that effectively transferred the capabilities it had is Addvalue Technologies. The medium-sized enterprise has been listed on the Singapore stock exchange since 2000, having made its name in designing and manufacturing satellite communications devices which allow people to stay in touch in remote areas where it’s difficult to get cell connection – such as mountainous regions and oceans. Addvalue identified a problem in the satellite industry. Nanosatellites usually enter low Earth orbit, which is at an altitude of 2,000km or less. In order to remain in orbit against the Earth's gravitational pull, they need to travel at a speed that takes them around the globe in 90 minutes. This is in contrast to satellites in geostationary orbit – typically used in telecommunications and for broadcast – which orbit the earth high enough and fast enough to match the earth's rate of rotation, thus they appear to remain at a fixed position in the sky to us on the ground. Operators of satellites in low Earth orbit can only contact them every 90 minutes, which is inefficient.  Satellites in low Earth orbit are typically used for monitoring and imaging purposes. That communication time lag could be particularly crucial when monitoring urgent and fast-changing developments, such as forest fires. So Addvalue modified its technology, developing an Internet Data Relay System (IDRS) – a terminal that could sit on every satellite in low Earth orbit and allow it to maintain on-demand contact with its operator. This would be the first time the technology is available commercially. In 2015, Addvalue put the IDRS terminal on a satellite launched by NTU as a proof of concept. Apart from the immediate commercial interest, the company said a successful proof of concept also demonstrates that Addvalue has the capability to compete in the new space age. \"The IDRS terminal that we offer right now (gives) us a track record - that we are able to produce a space product at low cost, short schedule, and fast turnaround at high volume, which will serve the needs of the new space industry,” said Dr Colin Chan, Chairman and CEO of Addvalue Technologies. He added that this is a device with high redundancy, as most nanosatellites have a short lifespan, and will typically be launched as part of a constellation of satellites. For example, Dr Chan explained that a first launch of 20 satellites may last for about three years, after which they will need to be replaced. “Basically we have a captive customer and offer a service that will give us recurring revenue. This model will apply to every other customer in there,” he said.  GETTING OFF THE GROUND Thus far, Singapore’s seven satellites have all been launched overseas. This includes Velox-II, the satellite that Addvalue put its IDRS terminal on, which was launched from India. But if some start-ups have their way, we could start launching them nearer to home someday. Equatorial Space Industries aims to build small, simple rockets in order to make it even cheaper and easier to bring nanosatellites to space. The start-up, which has been around for six months, is housed in National University of Singapore’s incubator space, The Hangar. The team, who are all in their 20s, was recently awarded the NUS Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practicum Grant. The problem, they say, is that very few countries have launch capabilities, and most of the satellites still ride on big rockets that take off infrequently. This means those who do not have launch capability have to queue for a spot on these rockets, leading to inflexible launch schedules. It is also highly inefficient, as the big rockets were designed for big and heavy satellites, which most satellites were up until 10 years ago. The Alphasat, for example, is the size of a double-decker bus and has a mass of more than 6.6 tonnes. Polish-born Simon Gwozdz, CEO of Equatorial Space Industries, first dreamed that Singapore could be a launch site when he was serving National Service on Pulau Tekong, and noticed the dredging platforms in the sea. “I was thinking: What if one of them was re-purposed for a launch site? Not on Tekong, but brought to sea,” he said. To Mr Gwozdz, Singapore is the perfect place to develop a company that launches nanosatellites in the new space age. One clear reason is that Singapore is very close to the equator, allowing efficient launches into equatorial orbits. A constellation of satellites in an equatorial orbit is particularly attractive to low-latitude countries as it can offer constant coverage with about 30 satellites, as compared to hundreds of satellites if they were launched into north-to-south polar orbits. This effectively unlocks the potential for the space industry in Asia. So a network of satellites in equatorial orbit would be a significant reduction in cost for operators seeking to set up global networks with 24/7 coverage. One potential use of such a network is to enable a nation-wide network of sensors for autonomous vehicles.  Currently, there are few launch sites near the equator – and even fewer of them are close to industrial hubs like Singapore that can provide the necessary operations, maintenance and transport support. “Singapore is probably the only place in the world that's so close to the equator, that's so developed, and that actually has a perfect prospective launch site so nearby,” said Mr Gwozdz. His dream launch site, situated a short boat ride from Singapore in the South China Sea, will be able to launch satellites into both equatorial and polar orbits, he said. “The maritime, aviation, and petrochemical industries – they truly supply all the hardware and skillsets that you need ...  the sea launch would be very easily supported by (our) very strong maritime base,\" he said. “Singapore could not only participate in the launch industry, it could actually dominate in the years to come.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/space-technology-singapore-companies-shoot-for-the-stars-10365492"}, {"datetime": "05 Jun 2018 06:27AM", "tags": ["HDB", "housing", "public housing", "MND"], "author": "Wong Pei Ting", "title": "The Big Read: No easy answers to HDB lease decay issue, but public mindset has to change first", "content": " SINGAPORE: When the lease of his three-room flat in Lorong 4 Toa Payoh runs out in 2066, first aid and swimming coach Low Mong Seng, 34, expects the Government to give him “something in compensation”. “Either another shelter over our heads, or a lower lump sum amount (compared to the value of the property) for us to get another flat to stay in,” said Mr Low, who inherited the unit from his mother who died in 1995. But another homeowner, who gave her name only as Ms Kwok, has a different view. There is “a misunderstanding (among the public) of what homeownership is”, she said. “People think ‘ownership’ means a freehold ownership but if you buy a leasehold then obviously the limited lease is reflected,” added the 30-year-old lawyer. Three years ago, she bought a three-room flat in Tiong Bahru — completed in 1973 — with her husband. The issue of the lease expiry of older Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats has seized many homeowners in Singapore, since a blog post in March last year by National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. Mr Wong had cautioned that not all old flats will be automatically eligible for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERSs) — amid media reports of buyers paying huge sums of money for ageing resale flats, in the hope that the flats would be identified for SERS. As at Dec 31 last year, HDB manages a total of about one million flats. The vast majority of flats have more than 60 years of lease remaining, HDB said in response to queries. About 9 per cent of flats (or 90,000) have leases that commenced more than 40 years ago, it added. The first batch of HDB flats with leases that will expire in about 50 years are located in Geylang and Queenstown. \"As the leases run down, especially towards the tail-end, the flat prices will come down correspondingly,\" Mr Wong had said, adding: So buyers need to do their due diligence and be realistic when buying flats with short leases. This is especially important for young couples, who have to plan for a much longer future. The issue has received substantial airing in Parliament since, with Members of Parliament (MPs) raising concerns and suggestions. Last month, Mr Wong said the Government is studying the issue, as he highlighted the complexities involved. \"It will be easy for me to give you a politically expedient answer now and try to wave away the problem. But there are serious trade-offs and ramifications to consider,\" he said, adding: Ultimately, the Government must grapple with these difficult questions, study the matter, and do the responsible thing.

READ: 99-year HDB leases a chance to review home ownership and retirement policies, a commentary. Meanwhile, some owners of ageing flats have been spooked, amid a tepid HDB resale market which has seen prices fall for six consecutive quarters. A homeowner at Block 117 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, who declined to be named, said he put up his 50-year-old three-room flat for sale about six months ago, out of concern that its value will fall following Mr Wong’s comments. There have been no takers yet, even though several prospective buyers have viewed the unit — and even though he has priced it under S$290,000, while other comparable flats in the area sold for as high as S$340,000, said the man in his mid-70s who is the flat’s second owner, having bought it more than 30 years ago at S$10,000. Similarly, Mr Calvin Loh, 38, a hardware goods showroom manager, said he is also getting anxious about the value of his Commonwealth Close flat, which has 47 years of lease left. He noted how a former neighbour sold his three-room unit for S$400,000 four years ago, but a similar unit in the same block changed hands for just S$280,000 a few months ago. To these long-time homeowners, it does not matter that in absolute terms, the price which they can get for their ageing flat will be many times higher than what they bought it for. What weighs on their mind is the worry that they are not getting a high enough price, relative to what they could have gotten when the flat was younger or the cost of an alternative home on the market today. High-profile million dollar sales of old resale flats in good locations, which have been highlighted by some sections of the media, further skews the market and raises the expectation of sellers. ‘UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION’ This is, however, an unrealistic expectation, experts stressed. “Owners of leasehold properties need to realise that the value of their properties is indeed the value of the remaining lease,” said ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim who added: When the remaining lease is depleting, it is not realistic to expect the prices to remain high. Among other factors, flats with less than 60 years’ lease may start to depreciate as prospective buyers would have limited use of their Central Provident Funds to help finance the purchase of the flat. As the flats get even older, financing options from HDB or banks also become more limited. “When that happens, flat owners may have to accept that their older flats may not be able to command as high a price anymore, and may be more difficult to sell in the open market,” Mr Lim said. Mr Ku Swee Yong, chief executive officer of International Property Advisor, noted that the situation has been made worse by buyers overpaying for ageing resale flats in recent years, and price decline going forward is “inevitable”. “(The) prices of well-located old flats have reached high levels not commensurate with their future cash flow value (from a rental perspective),” he said. While lease expiry is a challenging issue faced by policymakers in all countries with public housing programmes including China and the United Kingdom for example, it is a political hot potato especially in Singapore, where more than 80 per cent of the resident population live in HDB flats. Moreover, homeownership is “far more popular than renting in Singapore and, arguably, an intrinsic part of the social compact”, said Singapore Management University (SMU) law don Eugene Tan. “Relying on a contractual understanding of the leases is legally appropriate (for the Government) but politically limiting and divisive,” he noted. Pointing out that the HDB flat is the “most valuable asset” for vast majority of Singaporeans, Assoc Prof Tan added: We have reached a stage where the emerging narrative for more and more flats is one of their depreciating value, rather than the dominant narrative of it being an appreciating asset. There is much at stake for all … the HDB flat also represents for many Singaporeans an important form of retirement security. At the heart of the debate is a very Singaporean view of public housing flats as “sure-win” investments — a mindset that the Government is partly responsible for shaping, experts pointed out. National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser said: “I reckon the years of experiencing asset enhancement and social upgrading have been deeply ingrained in the Singaporean psyche.  Moreover, they also believe that at some point, the expiring lease would be reset via en bloc.” Mr Ku added: “The idea is already ingrained in us, so much so that many permanent residents (on top of Singaporeans) also buy into the idea that HDB flats are certain to make profits.” Still, experts were divided on whether the narrative of HDB flats as assets remains valid today and in future: It is true that unless buyers overpaid for a resale flat, chances are high that they can still sell it off for a profit. For most homeowners, the value of their flat has, without a doubt, increased exponentially compared to the price which they had paid for it years back.  However, it is also clear that the value of a flat cannot be perpetually rising and there will come a point in time — at least a decade from now even for the oldest flats — when it drops dramatically, as its remaining lease falls under 30 years. READ: A bold vision of housing for seniors, a commentary. THE ‘ASSET ENHANCEMENT’ NARRATIVE The People’s Action Party (PAP) Government has long held up homeownership as a way to give citizens a direct stake in the country. Over time, its “asset enhancement policy” became a buzz phrase for public housing. Since the 1990s, it has drummed in the idea of an HDB flat as both a home and an asset, providing Singaporeans an important form of retirement security. Former Prime Ministers — Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong — made bold pitches for asset enhancement, while in the last decade or so, government leaders continued to refer to an HDB flat as a “key investment asset”. At a dinner for the International Housing Conference held in 2010 by HDB, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong linked the value of HDB flats to the strength of the economy: “Provided Singapore continues to do well, our flats will maintain their value, and Singaporeans can enjoy an appreciating asset.” In 2011, then-National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan also reiterated the importance of the policy as he rebutted a suggestion by the Workers’ Party to peg the prices of new flats to the incomes of qualifying households instead of resale market prices. Mr Mah had added: “I want to say we are proud of the asset enhancement policy. The policy is what has given almost all Singaporeans a home of their own, a home that also an asset (which) grows in value over time.” However, in 2013, then-National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan broached the issue of diminishing market value of HDB resale flats in Parliament: “Looking ahead, as we may no longer get the same kind of returns from re-selling an HDB flat as in the past, how will its role as an asset be affected? If it is likely to diminish, how should we make the adjustments?” Mr Khaw’s comments came after the first million-dollar flat changed hands in July 2012, at Block 149 Mei Ling Street in Queenstown. But it appears that Mr Khaw’s warning was not enough to deter buyers from dishing out big bucks for HDB resale flats. Since the first million-dollar HDB flat transaction in Queenstown, at least 89 flats have been sold for S$1 million or more, according to public data.  The trend called for a starker warning, and Mr Wong duly delivered it in his blog post in March last year. A month later, he responded to strong public reactions to his blog post, as some questioned how the asset-enhancement policy for public housing would apply when HDB flats have to be returned to the Government upon expiry of their lease. Mr Wong reiterated that HDB flats provide a “good store of asset value, so long as you plan ahead and make prudent housing decisions”.  He cited a hypothetical example of a 30-year-old couple, with a combined monthly income of S$5,000, looking for a resale flat in Woodlands near their parents. “They can get up to S$75,000 in grants off the resale flat price, and should easily afford a flat with a reasonably long lease of 90 years,” he said. “Thirty-five years later, the couple will be 65 and the remaining lease of the flat will be 55 years. They still have an asset which can be monetised for retirement.” Experts noted that the Singapore public has lapped up the “asset enhancement” message so much that it is inconceivable for many homeowners today that the value of their flats would head south towards the tail-end of the lease. “One entire generation has already made their profits. Those who are left holding their flats today are disappointed that they did not downsize or sell out to extract their profits (earlier)” Mr Ku said. But Mr Alan Cheong, senior director of research and consultancy at Savills, warned that there could be profound consequences — such as worsening social inequality — if HDB flats were to be treated as “depreciating assets”. OUTLOOK FOR RESALE PRICES OF AGEING FLATS Speaking in Parliament last month, Mr Wong acknowledged concerns about the impact of lease expiry on resale prices. But he stressed that there is still value in older HDB flats, which can be unlocked for retirement. Citing transaction data over the past year, he noted that an older four-room flat with less than 60 years remaining would sell for around S$300,000 and a five-room flat would sell for around S$400,000 in non-mature estates. For flats in more popular locations, prices can be significantly higher – more than double the price, Mr Wong said. Apart from the length of the remaining lease, transacted prices depend on other attributes such as location, the storey height, and the condition of the flat, he added. The sales proceeds from older flats \"would be more than sufficient to purchase a smaller flat for retirement\", he said. Those who prefer to stay in the same place can also use the Lease Buyback Scheme, where they can sell part of the remaining lease to HDB or have the option of renting out a bedroom. Mr Wong reiterated that existing monetisation schemes are working. Nevertheless, the Government will continue to review and enhance them, he said. However, in a commentary, NUS Institute of Real Estate Studies director Sing Tien Foo wrote that there is a “significant negative relationship between HDB resale prices and age”. His analysis was based on a large sample of public resale flat transactions from 1997 to 2017, and after controlling for the quality of transacted resale flats — such as the flat attributes (unit area and floor height), and distance to schools and MRT stations.  Using resale flats of less than 10 years as the reference, the discounts are estimated at 8.3 per cent and 9.5 per cent for resale flats of 40 to 50 years and those between 50 and 60 years old, respectively, Assoc Prof Sing said. Without a doubt, a homeowner who bought his flat in the late ‘60s for example can easily sell it today at a price more than 40 times compared to what he had paid, analysts noted. Even for those who bought their flats some years back, it is likely that they can sell it for a profit. It may be a different story, however, for ageing flats which were bought recently — and this is how it should be, analysts said. An effective property market should reflect flats’ decaying lease and these units should be sold accordingly, in terms of pricing. As to the residual value for such flats, the analysts reiterated that even this will plunge dramatically when the units have less than 30 years of lease left. Applying a common industry forecasting template that correlates the value of land with respect to its remaining lease, Mr Ku predicts that a flat which was completed in 1975 — and priced at S$860,000 today — would fetch only S$180,000 in 2054, when it has 20 years of lease left. When the time comes, “how many buyers will put down such a large sum of money to use a property for 20 years”, he questioned. Public data on HDB resale transactions in the last three years showed that older flats — those with half of their 99-year lease remaining or less — were fetching lower amounts, and underperforming compared to the rest of the HDB resale market. While experts noted that the sample size was too small to draw any conclusion, they observed some anxiety creeping into the HDB resale segment. Mr Colin Tan, director of research and consultancy at Suntec Real Estate Consultants, said the priority for now should be to “quell any panic”. OrangeTee & Tie managing director Steven Tan, for one, believes that the market for older HDB flats will be stirred back to life in the short to medium term, notwithstanding the longer term price trajectory.  “As the overall market sentiment improves, led by the recovery in the private residential market, HDB resale prices is expected to bottom out in the foreseeable future,” he said. HDB noted that flats with a shorter lease may appeal to certain groups: For example, elderly homeowners looking to right-size their home, families who are not yet ready to commit to a longer lease, and buyers looking for a home in more central locations with established amenities. “There continues to be healthy demand for such flats in the market, and there is value in these flats that can be unlocked for retirement,” HDB reiterated. In terms of prices, HDB noted that its resale price index has fallen by 2.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 2016, “following the earlier property cooling measures”. “As the (index) shows the general market price trend, it follows that the transaction prices of all flats, regardless of age, would generally experience a slight dip within this period,” HDB said. Noting that the attractiveness of an HDB flat is “dependent on many factors, not just the length of the lease”, HDB stressed that it would be “inaccurate” to look at price changes alone to determine whether prices for older flats have fallen more, “as such a comparison does not take into account differences in other flat attributes, especially location”. MPS’ SUGGESTIONS AND TRADE-OFFS For many owners of old flats, SERS is the best-case scenario. Residents of blocks of flats identified for SERS will get the opportunity to move to a new home with a fresh 99-year lease, and continue living close to their current neighbours. They will also be given compensation and rehousing benefits. Among the suggestions brought up during last month’s debate on the President’s Address, Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC MP Alex Yam proposed that the Government consider applying SERS to all HDB flats when their lease runs under 40 years. Mr Yam said this will allow the use of parcels of land to be intensified with topped-up leases, while easing the country’s reliance on “constant piecemeal upgrading” in old estates, which he felt was “not the most cost-efficient”. But such a proposal will put a huge financial strain on the Government, experts said. Mr Ku estimates that it will cost the Government S$3.5 billion annually from 2030. Similarly, Assoc Prof Sing felt there is no urgent need to increase the pace of SERS, which could “significantly increase” the Government’s expenditure. “The current approach of SERS is an appropriate one, while allowing some older housing stocks to be replaced, redeveloped and intensified into newer housing blocks,” he added. In his parliamentary speech last month, Mr Wong also pointed out that the authorities cannot assume that everyone wants a lease extension. More maintenance will be needed for older flats, and this will be costly for residents, he said. Also, if all 99-year leases were to be automatically renewed for extended periods, there will not be sufficient land to provide affordable housing for future generations of Singaporeans, HDB said. Apart from adding to Government expenditure, Mr Cheong said that extending the leases of older flats will also impede urban renewal, with the older estates affecting the aesthetics of nearby newer ones. However, Mr Tan Kok Keong, co-founder of FundPlaces which develops blockchain platforms for the real estate industry, felt it would be a palatable option for many owners of ageing flats. “A lease top-up at minimal cost. Why wouldn’t I not want it? Even if I don’t want (to continue living in the flat), I can sell and get better money,” he said. There has also been a suggestion for private developers to come into the picture. Fengshan MP Cheryl Chan has proposed a “modified form of SERS”, which would involve private developers compensating flat owners and buying over the land from the Government, so they can top up its lease for private development. She has also suggested changing the valuation method for ageing flats so that it is based on their remaining lease and right-sizing potential, extending the lease for flats in selected mature towns, and reassessing the property loan structure for prospective buyers. She said she felt that her “modified SERS” proposal could also result in better social mixing, with private estates better interspersed among HDB blocks.  Both Mr Tan, from FundPlaces, and SMU’s Assoc Prof Tan said it was a sound idea, as it could be a win-win situation for all parties — residents, developers and the Government — and also enable the lower-income group to benefit from the en bloc fever sweeping through private residential developments.  Mr Tan agreed that the construction of condominiums in older HDB estates would encourage greater social mixing. However, if this was done a large scale, it could risk HDB neighbourhoods losing their character, he noted. Mr Ku felt that the idea was not feasible administratively, given that a parcel of land typically has to be cleared first, then demarcated before being sold to private developers. “You cannot put a piece of land up for tender if you cannot define the site boundaries,” he added. Ms Chan acknowledged that the issue was complex, and said that her idea cannot be adopted in isolation. “You can’t just use one single lever and expect it to work because this is a free market after all, which is why I am suggesting certain things that the Ministry (of National Development) should start looking into so that we can start testing with a pool of flats and gradually make changes as we move along,” she said. Indeed, experts believe there is no single solution to the conundrum. It may entail a mix of different policy options, on a case-by-case basis. But of more pressing need is for buyers and sellers to adjust their mindset, to befit reality. “This issue of ‘decaying leases’ is likely to be a circle that cannot be squared,” said SMU’s Assoc Prof Tan. However, some like Mr Ku from International Property Advisor felt that the mindset could be already shifting among the younger generation who are “less smitten with homeownership” — as in the case of Ms Kwok. She and her husband bought their three-room Tiong Bahru flat, which had 57 years left on its lease, for about S$650,000. She said they did it “with two eyes open”, knowing that it will depreciate down to zero when its lease expires. “I suppose it is good that (people are discussing about this now) … (But) it is a strange conversation … The leasehold is what it is. You have a lease,” she said.   Her husband added: “If you think about it, 99 years (covers) two generations, so if (homeowners) were concerned about inheritance, the second generation is enjoying that… The kids of our neighbours are already around 40 years old. They have children. They probably have their own flats as well.” As far as Mr Ang Hong King, 72, is concerned, his three-room flat which he bought for S$6,000 in 1970, has served its purpose — providing a roof over his family’s head for almost five decades and counting. The semi-retired driver and his wife raised their three daughters in the unit at Block 65 Circuit Road. Their children have since moved out, and gotten flats of their own. Having no plans to move out, Mr Ang shrugged off the prospect of his flat — which is worth about S$250,000 now — losing its value in the future. “Price drop also never mind,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/big-read-hdb-lease-decay-public-mindset-change-homeownership-10361572"}, {"datetime": "04 Jun 2018 07:39PM", "tags": ["Hyflux", "companies", "business"], "author": "", "title": "Hyflux to meet lenders this week to discuss financial woes, in preliminary talks for funding", "content": " SINGAPORE: Embattled Singapore water treatment firm Hyflux said on Monday (Jun 4) it will be meeting with banks this week to discuss its debts and ongoing reorganisation process, after various obligations owed to lenders and creditors fell through.  In an update to the Singapore Exchange (SGX), Hyflux also said that it is in preliminary discussions with interested financiers for funding.

In an interview with South China Morning Post columnist Tom Plate published on Monday (Jun 4), Mr Lee said the choice of Singapore as host nation shows that it is friends with both parties “and they believe we can do a good job of it”. It is also “politically acceptable” for both of them to be here, he added, though the two countries \"have a very difficult task”. “This summit is taking place at not very long notice, and without … extensive preparation or contact between the two sides,” Mr Lee said. “It is not easy to make a sudden breakthrough, but it is the first step towards both sides resuming a dialogue.” Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen had on Saturday said the country is gearing up to play host to the meeting, with security agencies from the Home Team and the Singapore Armed Forces busy planning to make sure everything is safe. He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue. “NOT NECESSARY TO BE ENEMIES” On US-China relations, Mr Lee hoped the former will conclude that it can still do business with the latter despite their differences. “It is up to you (the US) how you want to see the world. The question is what conclusion you will reach,” he said. “Do you conclude that the Chinese have to be like you, in order to be your friend? Or do you conclude that they do not have to be like you, yet you can still do business with them? We do hope that you can come to the second conclusion, because it is not necessary for you to be enemies just because you are different from them.” He added: “They do not think less of you just because you do not have a Communist Party of the United States.” The prime minister also warned of a reaction from China’s end if the US adopts a negative attitude. “They are already suspicious of you, that you intend to frustrate their ambitions to greatness … The Chinese do not feel they should be sat upon in judgment,” he said. Mr Lee pointed to the planned US trade sanctions on China as an example, saying that based on his feeling “from our people and just reading the papers” there is actually quite wide support in the US. “Even (New York Times columnist) Thomas Friedman feels so … He is not a natural hawk. … So there are people who do not have a lot of time for the Trump administration, who agree with him on this matter,” he said. Asked if there is a “fundamental cleavage” pushing the US and China further apart, Mr Lee said it does not have to go down that road, but a wider mistrust can easily develop from trade frictions. “Because now, it is not just trade, exchange or currency exchange rates, but you are also blocking their investments, more than before,” he said. “If you do not want to run a trade deficit with them, yet you do not want to sell them what they want to buy – either companies or strategic goods – then what is the outcome?”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/trump-kim-meeting-first-step-towards-resuming-talks-pm-lee-10369518"}, {"datetime": "04 Jun 2018 06:49PM", "tags": ["blackout"], "author": "", "title": "Power outage in central Singapore caused by maintenance work at substation: SP Group", "content": " SINGAPORE: A power outage that hit several parts of central Singapore last Friday was caused by maintenance work done by SP Group at a substation that day, the energy utilities company said in a Facebook post on Monday (Jun 4).

Both the boy and his sister cannot be named due to a gag order. The court heard that the boy sexually assaulted his sister, who is two years his junior, in 2013. That was the year he started watching pornography.  Then 12 years old, the boy was at home alone with his sister when he became sexually aroused after watching a bedroom scene on television. He threatened to tell their parents that she had used her mobile phone if she did not do what he wanted, the court heard. He then penetrated her without a condom and stopped when she complained of pain. Their parents subsequently found out that the boy had touched his sister’s private parts on several occasions. They did not lodge a police report, but since 2014, both children had been seeing a counsellor from the Counselling and Care Centre.  Arrangements were also made for the boy to move to his grandparents’ home so as to keep him away from his sister. After six months of counselling, the boy was allowed to move back to the flat as he had been assessed to have reintegrated well. Then one night in August 2016, feeling a “strong sexual urge”, he went to his sister’s room and asked her to follow him to his bedroom. There, he touched her private parts.  That same month, the teen's mother shared with the counsellor from the Counselling and Care Centre that he had continued to commit sexual offences against the victim. The matter was then referred to the Child Protective Service of the Ministry of Social and Family Development. In April 2017, the children's mother lodged a police report, stating that her daughter had been \"touched inappropriately\" by her elder brother. On Monday, the boy pleaded guilty to one charge of sexually assaulting his sister and another charge of using criminal force with the intent to outrage her modesty. Six other charges were taken into consideration. MOTHER ASKS FOR LENIENCY Deputy Public Prosecutor Raja Mohan said the boy assaulted his sister due to proximity, and because he was confident that she would not reveal what he did to their parents. District Judge May Mesenas, who called for a probation suitability report, said the effects of the teen’s actions will be permanent and that his sister will take a long time to heal. “I can’t imagine what your sister had to go through,” she said. When asked what she would like to say, the teens’ mother broke down and asked for leniency. Their father, who was also in court, asked for the judge to show mercy. The teen is currently seeing a psychologist with the Ministry of Social and Family Development and a psychiatrist at the National University Hospital, the court heard. He is staying at his grandmother’s house, away from his family, and sees his parents every week. The last time he saw his sister was in church last Sunday, he said when asked by judge Mesenas. “It was very wrong of me. I would like to apologise to her,” the teen said when asked if he had anything to say. He added that he did not receive appropriate treatment after the first offence. The boy is expected to be sentenced on Jul 9. For sexually assaulting a minor under the age of 14, he may be jailed for up to 20 years, fined and caned. For using criminal force, intending to outrage the modesty of a minor under the age of 14, he faces a maximum jail term of five years, a fine, caning, or a combination of punishments.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/boy-16-convicted-of-sexually-assaulting-younger-sister-10367228"}, {"datetime": "04 Jun 2018 05:25PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "North Korea", "Kim Jong Un"], "author": "", "title": "Area around Shangri-La Hotel declared 'special event area' for Trump-Kim summit", "content": " SINGAPORE: The area around Shangri-La Hotel Singapore has been designated as a special event area for the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Not a problem, if you’re in a Grab car equipped with a “convenience store”. That is the value proposition of Grab&Go, a new service the ride-hailing company is offering via its partnership with US-based in-car commerce start-up Cargo that was announced on Monday (Jun 4). Private-hire cars equipped with Grab&Go will be able to offer passengers a mix of complimentary samples and retail products. The samples include Biore UV body care serum, Novu’s skin masks and Lux Luminique Botanical haircare range, said Cargo in the press release. Other products on offer include Milo can drinks, Mentos, Oreo cookies and Aqua mineral water, said Cargo founder Jeff Cripe in an email to Channel NewsAsia.  Passengers make their purchases through Grab&Go’s online menu via their smartphones.  After making their selection, they enter a unique five-digit code to make sure payment goes to the right driver, and the cost is added to the final Grab fare. The driver will hand over the products to the passenger once the vehicle is safely stopped, the company said.  “In Southeast Asia, Grab and Cargo identified trendy snack and beauty brands that would surprise and delight passengers,” said Mr Cripe of the product mix on offer. DRIVERS GET EXTRA INCOME Beyond the convenience for passengers, Grab&Go drivers will also get to earn extra revenue. Each time someone makes a purchase or takes a sample for free, the Grab driver will earn a cut, with Cargo saying they could earn an additional S$75 to S$250 a month.  Mr Cripe explained that Grab&Go drivers earn 20 per cent commission for every paid sale and a S$1 bonus on every transaction, with the remainder going to Grab&Go.  He added this partnership with Grab is its first international foray, following its US launch last June. The US start-up said it raised US$8.5 million in venture funds to scale its operations across the US and international markets. The service is launching with 1,000 cars, but he added the hope is to bring Grab&Go to “Grab’s 2 million-plus driver-partners across Southeast Asia”.  “Hundreds” of GrabCar drivers have signed up to offer the service, the ride-hailing company separately told Channel NewsAsia, and it is actively bringing those interested on board the programme.  “At Grab, we are always thinking about ways to better serve our customers,” said its head of Regional Advertising Nash Islam. “We’re excited to partner with Cargo to deliver more value to our passengers, while increasing the number of income streams available to our driver-partners.” This is the latest initiative by the ride-hailing company to monetise the time passengers spend while commuting using its platform. In April this year, Grab signed a memorandum of understanding with Mediacorp to co-create content for passengers and provide income opportunities for its drivers. Those interested can deck out their cars with in-car tablet or other media assets like car wraps and in-car hangers for additional income, they said then. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/grab-partners-cargo-for-grab-go-service-10364466"}, {"datetime": "04 Jun 2018 02:27PM", "tags": ["crime", "scam"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Taiwanese man jailed for role in police impersonation scam that cheated victims of S$1 million", "content": " SINGAPORE: In two weeks, a Taiwanese national who was part of a transnational scam syndicate collected nearly S$1 million cheated from Singaporeans, and handed over the money to others in the syndicate. For his role in the scam which involved the impersonation of a police officer, Huang Ying-Chun, 53, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years' jail on Monday (Jun 4). The court heard that sometime in June last year, Huang was approached by someone known as “Ah Fei” to work for him. Huang was to collect and hand over “documents” in Singapore, and would be paid S$2,700. He arrived in Singapore on Jun 21, along with fellow Taiwanese and co-accused Chen Peng-Yu. “Huang knew he was doing something illegal in collecting and handing over the monies,” court documents stated. He collected money belonging to seven victims, aged between 50 and 82, on 13 occasions.  The oldest victim was the hardest hit, losing S$650,000. The scam's modus operandi, according to court documents, involves an unknown caller cheating victims into providing their DBS or POSB login credentials. The money would then be transferred into the accounts of Singaporeans, who would be instructed by someone claiming to be a police officer to withdraw the money and pass it to Huang. Huang would usually deliver the money to Chen.  Huang was arrested a day after a 55-year-old woman reported losing about S$225,000. She received a call from an unknown person claiming to be a police officer, who told her that she was being investigated for money laundering offences. Her call was transferred to another unknown person who said he was a police officer from another country. She was then given a link to a website purportedly from the Singapore Police Force, and instructed to key in her Internet banking credentials. She later realised that her bank account had been accessed illegally without her knowledge, with about S$225,000 transferred to unknown accounts.

The offer comes after a media report that the cash-strapped North may have trouble bearing the cost of its leader's stay in Singapore and the large delegation of security and support staff for the meeting scheduled for Jun 12. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, said it was willing to use its prize money to pay for any accommodation or meeting space needed to make the summit a success. \"The Nobel Peace Prize included a cash prize and we are offering funds from the prize to cover the costs for the summit, in order to support peace in the Korean Peninsula and a nuclear-weapon-free world,\" ICAN official Akira Kawasaki said. \"This is a historic meeting, and once in a generation opportunity\" to help establish a world free of the threat of nuclear weapons,\" Kawasaki told Reuters by telephone from Tokyo. Kawasaki heads the Tokyo-based Peace Boat, one of ICAN's 10 international steering groups. The intention to spend the prize money is in line with the work the group has done to lobby for the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations but not any of the nuclear weapons states or North Korea. \"It's not about paying for luxury rooms for the leader of the DPRK or anyone, that's not our intention,\" Kawasaki said.

On Mar 20, 2015, Yeo Chye Mong Stephen, who was employed as a safety coordinator and patrol man by Foo Ngan Marine, a subcontractor of Jurong Shipyard, was conducting safety checks at 5 Jalan Samulun. He was doing so near the manifolds located along the track of a gantry crane that was in operation, lifting pieces of rolled up welding cables. Shortly after, a co-worker found Yeo lying on the ground between a utility water supply manifold and the gantry crane’s track.  He was taken to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries later that day. \n\n\n\n\n Investigations revealed there was a systemic failure in how Jurong Shipyard performed the lifting operation using the gantry crane, MOM said, adding that these failures made the workplace dangerous, and also resulted in the accident, which led to the death.  The failures included not ensuring that there were sufficient visual warning signs to keep out of the lifting zone while operations were in progress. The company also failed to appoint a banksman to ensure that the travelling path of the gantry crane along the track was free from people within the lifting zone, MOM said. \n\n\n\n\n It also failed to ensure that there was sufficient passageway clearance between the gantry crane track and the utility water supply manifold, MOM added. Mr Sebastian Tan, MOM’s Director of Occupational Safety and Health Inspectorate, said there were several safety lapses that were not addressed in this case.  \"The width of the passageway for the gantry crane fell short of established safety standards as set out in the Code of Practice. Inadequacy in the risk assessment resulted in the lack of control measures to monitor and coordinate the safe movement of workers during lifting operations involving the gantry crane.  \"The company could have taken simple measures such as the deployment of banksman or warning signs to prevent the accident but it did not.

The BRI initiative - which applies the values of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit - provides a path for shared development between China and the region. Mr Heng said Singapore is an early supporter of the BRI.  “According to Chinese statistics, Singapore accounted for 85 per cent of total inbound investments to China from Belt and Road countries,” Mr Heng said. “Nearly one-third of China’s outbound investments to Belt and Road countries flow through Singapore.\" Mr Heng also talked about how both countries can take their partnership and friendship to the next level.  “Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Xi Jinping have affirmed that Singapore and China shared a demonstrative, strategic and forward-looking relationship,\" Mr Heng said. “They have aptly characterised our relations as an ‘All-round cooperative partnership progressing with the times’. “It is timely to explore how we can take our mutually beneficial cooperation to the next level.\" Mr Heng added Singapore’s 4G leaders are more involved in improving bilateral ties between Singapore and China.     Today, Singapore has seven Provincial Business Councils with Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan, Tianjin and Zhejiang.   These councils - which aim to promote economic exchanges and cooperation between both sides - are co-chaired by the younger Singapore Ministers as well as the vice ministers, governors and vice governors of the respective provinces. Mr Heng himself co-chairs the Singapore-Jiangsu Cooperation Council with Jiangsu governor Wu Zhenglong.  And as both countries move forward, their cooperation will be based on what Mr Heng describes as “important leadership and governance principles”. “It involves first ensuring that each of us deals with our internal challenges and opportunities. Yet, at the same time, we work closely with one another to advance our common interests,” Mr Heng said.  'THREE MAJOR SHIFTS' Mr Heng also shared three areas Singapore hopes to do well in. They include ensuring governance and policies change with the times and remaining relevant. “Looking ahead, there are three major shifts that many countries will have to prepare for: the shift in global economic weight towards Asia, the emergence of new technologies and ageing populations,” Mr Heng said.  “These will interact in different ways, bring new challenges, but also new opportunities. Government policies must adapt to these changes to best serve the people’s needs,” he said.  One example, Mr Heng added, is managing an ageing population - a trend common in Singapore and China.   Mr Heng also said it’s important to formulate policies with depth and breadth which comes with a long-term view.  And this, Mr Heng said, must be done through engaging citizens.  “For example, to further develop Singapore’s economy, we launched the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). Companies, trade associations, unions, and government agencies form partnerships to understand their specific challenges and opportunities.  “This enables industry-specific strategies to be developed,” he said.  Mr Heng also said Singapore seeks to actively collaborate with and learn from other countries, and maintain good relations. “In a world that is rapidly changing and increasingly inter-connected, countries need to collaborate,” Mr Heng said, adding that no country has all the expertise it needs.  Mr Heng said collaborations can achieve win-win outcomes, as reflected in Mr Deng Xiaoping’s policy to reform and open China 40 years ago, and President Xi’s leadership for the BRI. But to facilitate international collaboration, a stable and favourable global environment is key, as developments or actions by one country can affect its neighbours.  Mr Heng said Singapore - a founding member of regional bloc ASEAN - will continue to build good relations with other countries, and seek to maintain peace and stability in Southeast Asia.  And on top of playing a constructive role to international affairs, Mr Heng said: “Singapore aims to be a friend to many countries and an enemy of none.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-strengthen-ties-china-4g-leadership-heng-swee-keat-10362908"}, {"datetime": "04 Jun 2018 11:48AM", "tags": ["Singapore Polytechnic", "Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore", "workplace safety"], "author": "Gwyneth Teo", "title": "Singapore Polytechnic, waste management recycling association to work together on innovative solutions for waste industry", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore Polytechnic (SP) and the Waste Management & Recycling Association of Singapore (WMRAS) will be working together to bring technological solutions to the waste industry, in a move that will help support the nation's zero waste goal. The two organisations also agreed to work together to support workplace safety and health in the environmental services industry. The collaboration will allow innovations being developed at SP to be tailored to the uses and needs of Singapore's waste industry and the wider economy as a whole.  At the signing of the memorandum of understanding on Monday (Jun 4), Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources, noted that Singapore's only landfill will be completely filled in less than 20 years. \"For Singapore to achieve our visions of becoming a zero waste nation, we will have to adopt a circular economy model, where we minimise the waste generated and maximise the value and resources that we can extract from key waste streams,\" said Dr Khor. For instance, the Advanced Materials Technology Centre (AMTC) in SP has developed solutions in solid waste recycling and resource recovery. This includes projects such as the total conversion of incinerated ashes to foam glass, a 'green' chemical formulation for electronic waste recycling that yields higher amounts of precious metals in a short amount of time, and a process that recovers more than 90 per cent of material cost from recycling solar panels. \"Industry partners can leverage in the technology development strength of our technology centres and design-thinking infused approach to solving problems,\" said Mr Lim Peng Hun, Deputy Principal of Singapore Polytechnic.  In addition to these solutions, SP and WMRAS will also be starting a Chemical Management and Workplace Safety Programme to support worker safety and health. Under this programme, small-and-medium enterprises and professionals will undergo a two-day workshop, during which they will learn how to reduce occupational diseases, injuries, and fatalities from potential exposure to hazardous chemicals. The programme is expected to benefit 100 companies every year. The first workshop will take place later this year. During the workshop, attendees will also receive training in new knowledge and skills in achieving a pollution-free and zero waste environment. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-polytechnic-waste-management-recycling-association-to-10362462"}, {"datetime": "04 Jun 2018 07:39AM", "tags": ["Singapore", "haze", "NEA"], "author": "", "title": "Slight hazy Sunday due to 'accumulation of particulate matter': NEA", "content": " SINGAPORE: The burning smell that you might have sensed early on Sunday (Jun 3) was due to an \"accumulation of particulate matter under light wind conditions\".

Speaking at the close of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Dr Ng said it is clear from their actions that both China and the US are attempting to address \"perceived inequalities\" and principles or practices which disadvantage them. \"In both instances, core security considerations have been used to justify, if not make imperative, the need for such actions,\" he said.  \"Whatever the merits of arguments, these deviations from global norms challenge the status quo and accepted rules which have hitherto benefited Asia, and the regions beyond. All of us would agree that it is in our collective interest to preserve a system that has lifted millions in Asia from poverty.\" Dr Ng said that the US and China, by virtue of their sheer size, will be critical players as the world moves to what he called Globalisation 2.0. \"Many speakers before me have sounded a cautionary note that in this process, if the global commons are not preserved, or worse, fracture into de facto or formal trading and security alliances, then all of us are in for a rough time ahead,\" he said.

Dr Ng also said that the ASEAN-China Code of Conduct on the South China Sea as well as the ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise, which will take place later this year, are key to ASEAN’s efforts to strengthen the regional security architecture in today’s changing strategic landscape. Dr Ng called this year's Shangri-La Dialogue a success – with almost every security issue in the region and beyond discussed. Speaking to the media at the end of the forum, he said: \"I don't think there was a single topic that affects us in terms of security challenges in this region, even beyond, that wasn’t touched on.\" \"I think ministers and panelists did particularly well, in giving in their words, the passion that follows their conviction; what they felt and going even beyond what their aspirations were,\" he added.

China's announcement last July that it no longer wanted to import “foreign garbage” has created problems within the global recycling industry, which could mean that the plastic bottle you just “recycled” is actually destined for the incinerator. Like many Western countries, Singapore too has been sending a huge proportion of its recyclable plastic overseas. Until recently, most of this also made its way to China, as industry players pointed out that running a recycling operation here is not financially viable. In the longer term, however, observers say that exporting Singapore’s plastic recyclables to other countries, or even simply incinerating it, are both unsustainable. Responding to queries from Channel NewsAsia, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said it “recognises that there may be uncertainties involved in exporting plastic waste overseas”. According to latest United Nations trade data, Singapore in 2016 exported almost 42,000 tonnes of plastic waste to China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. These are countries which industry players said are top destinations for recyclable plastic. This figure is nearly three-quarters of the 59,500 tonnes of plastic that NEA said was recycled in the same year. While the total amount recycled only made up a meagre 7 per cent of the 822,200 tonnes of plastic waste generated in 2016, one observer believes China’s ban is another blow for the domestic recycling sector. RECYCLABLES INTO THE INCINERATOR? Mr Teri Teo, a project consultant at recycling firm LHT Holdings, said public waste collectors (PWC) that may have in the past collected household recyclables, sorted out the plastics and sold them to China, are now incinerating them instead. “They don’t want to sort the recyclables because there’s no demand,” he told Channel NewsAsia. “They cannot sell it, so they burn it.” LHT Holdings is a member of the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore, which also counts the four PWCs here as members. Among the PWCs contacted for comment on their operations following China’s ban, Sembwaste and Veolia ES did not respond, while Colex and 800 Super declined comment, with the latter citing the sensitivity of the matter. For now, to ensure that recyclables are collected and sent to material recovery facilities (MRF) in the first instance, NEA said it uses GPS systems to track the movement of the PWCs’ dedicated recycling trucks. “Recycling collection crews are required to scan the radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags fitted to the recycling bins when they collect recyclables and the information is recorded automatically in the RFID system for audit purposes,” it said. NEA added that its officers “regularly” check operations at the MRFs and incineration plants to ensure that recyclables are sorted and only items that cannot be recycled are sent to the incinerators. “Trucks for carrying recyclables are automatically detected at the incineration plants and are denied entry,” it stated. Once recyclables have been sorted at MRFs, however, there is still a strong likelihood much may still be diverted to incinerators, given how contamination is a key issue. “It is wrong to assume that what we dump into these bins are contaminant free,” said Mr Zach Lee, a research associate at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). “One issue with attempting to sort and recycle plastics in Singapore is the high rate of contamination with food waste.” In the long run, even as more plastic waste may find its way into Singapore’s incinerators, that in itself is also an unsustainable option. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources has stated that at the rate that Singapore is producing and burning waste, Semakau Landfill will run out of space by 2035. “As ash from incinerated waste eventually has to go into our (only) landfill, incineration alone cannot deal with the ever-increasing amount of waste that we are producing,” the ministry said on its website. While Mr Teo acknowledged the potential for public outrage if household recyclables are indeed being indiscriminately incinerated, he said waste companies are left with little choice. He claimed that the Government does not offer enough financial support to make recycling a sustainable business model in Singapore. Industry players said PWCs will continue to collect household recyclables under existing Government contracts and use various strategies to deal with them, including selling the unprocessed material to countries besides China. However, companies that survive on buying industrial recyclables from factories and exporting them will be the hardest hit. These companies don't deal with household recyclables because they lack volume and come with a higher risk of contamination. Mr Teo said following China's ban, most of these companies – called traders – have stopped collecting plastic recyclables, while some have fully ceased operations. Only a handful have invested in machinery to process the plastic into pellets, he added. RECYCLABLES TO OTHER COUNTRIES? One trader that hasn’t stopped buying plastic waste from factories is Gin Wee Recycling. Its managing director Ricky Tan told Channel NewsAsia that the company now sells the plastic to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. His clients in Malaysia are still Chinese companies that circumvent the ban by processing plastic there before exporting the recycled pellets to China. Previously, 80 per cent of his inventory was sold to China. The ban has also led to a 30 per cent drop in the price of plastic, Mr Tan said, pointing as well to weak currencies and taxes in the alternative markets. He said Chinese companies used to buy the plastic at S$0.80 a kilogramme, compared to S$0.50 in Malaysia now. Another trader, Liong Hup Soon, has also adopted a similar strategy, its shareholder who only wanted to be known as Mr Ho told Channel NewsAsia. The company’s sales took a 50 per cent hit after the ban was first announced last year, Mr Ho said, as plastic waste piled up in its storage facility up till February. “But because of the workaround, business is now back to how it was pre-ban,” he added. According to leading US recycling firm Berg Mill Supply, “all grades of plastic have seen a major shift to secondary markets” from 2016 to 2017, when China’s import restrictions came to light. In that period, Malaysia took in five times more polyvinyl chloride (PVC), while Vietnam more than doubled imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Before China’s ban on 24 types of solid waste including plastics, the country was recycling more than half of the world’s plastics to fuel a growing manufacturing sector. But as one expert explained, China’s solid waste handling plants are reaching full capacity amid its own growing waste sources. “Moreover, the national government of China made circular economy the national priority in recent years,” added Professor Seeram Ramakrishna, chair of the circular economy taskforce at the National University of Singapore (NUS).  Mr Tan expects to rely on alternative markets for the next three to five years, after which he believes the company has to start turning scrap into pellets. LHT Holdings’ Mr Teo said re-routing the plastic to other countries is unsustainable as they are also trying to implement a similar ban. “They also want to improve their image as a clean city,” he explained. “They also face strong environmental regulations in their countries on their own plastic waste, and concerns about the actual non-recyclable plastic waste that is being imported.” RECYCLING IN OUR OWN BACKYARD? Mr Dave Wong, business development manager at A~Star Plastic Recycling, agreed. “You won’t like your neighbour throwing rubbish in your house,” he said, noting that other countries will eventually follow in China’s footsteps. This is why his company recycles the industrial plastic scrap first rather than just exporting it, he said. “Every country should develop their own recycling capability,” he added. “Then, everybody will take care of their own scrap.” The ban has also given Mr Wong’s business a leg-up, as Chinese companies are forced to buy processed pellets as opposed to scrap. “In the past, we are not able to compete with Chinese recyclers,” he said. “Their operating cost is much lower than in Singapore, so we are not able to sell the recycled resin to China.” Still, Mr Wong said recycling plastic comes with high operating costs and challenges that include contamination and land constraints. He estimated that there are only about five plastic recycling companies left in Singapore, down from 20 in previous years. “Once plastic is contaminated, the cost of recycling will shoot up because you have to do cleaning and sorting,” he explained. “You also need to have a minimum quantity to start a batch process, meaning you need a big space to accumulate all these plastics.” Another challenge, NUS’ Prof Ramakrishna said, is the wide variety and combination of materials used in a growing number of products. For example, one plastic bottle can contain two or three different types of plastic. “Upcycling or recycling plastic requires well-sorted plastics with standardised specifications in required quantities for the potential users,” he explained. “This means investing in technology and automated plants for solid waste handling, separation and quality control.” WHAT NOW FOR RECYCLING? In light of these challenges, NEA said it is trying to develop more sustainable solutions for plastic waste management and improve local recycling capabilities in Singapore. One measure is the Closing the Waste Loop (CTWL) research and development initiative, which encourages institutes of higher learning, research institutes and private sector partners to collaborate and find solutions to increasing waste generation, scarcity of resources and land constraints. “A focus of the CTWL initiative is the development of solutions to enable a more ‘plastic resource efficient’ economy, and to extract value and resources from plastic waste,” NEA said. “The aim is to keep waste plastics as resources in the economic loop for as long as feasible, which will also help to reduce their impact on the environment.” Rather than just focusing on research and development, LHT Holdings’ Mr Teo said the Government should subsidise manufacturers of recycled products and create demand for such products. “This allows their product price to be competitive in the market, so they can be awarded Government projects,” he said. Prof Ramakrishna said Singapore might also need to partner countries in Asia to accumulate sufficient volumes of properly sorted plastic or solid waste. “For an organised waste management sector to be viable, it requires certain economies of scale,” he explained. REDUCE BEFORE RECYCLE But until the recycling sector is fundamentally transformed, reducing consumption seems to be way to go. “The ban places a greater urgency on the need to reduce the plastic waste generated by both individuals and companies,” said Singapore Environment Council executive director Jen Teo. Companies should choose suppliers that show a commitment to reducing packaging waste, she added, while retailers should consider changing the carriers and containers they provide to customers, including offering reusable bags as alternatives. NEA said it is stepping up engagement with stakeholders to avoid the excessive use of plastic disposables and implementing the mandatory packaging reporting framework by 2021. The latter requires businesses to submit reports on the types and amounts of packaging material they place on the market and their packaging waste reduction plans every year. As for individuals, Ms Teo encouraged them to bring their own reusable items, such as containers, bottles, cups and straws when dining out. “Retailers that offer discounts to customers who bring their own utensils will benefit from the patronage of the growing number of ethical green consumers looking to support companies with good environmental practices,” she added. Nevertheless, NTU's Mr Lee said implementing a practical solution would require a “careful analysis of the cost, benefits and consumer or producer behaviour related to plastic products and the reduction of plastic usage”. He added: “I believe this is something that needs to be worked on cohesively by the Government, private sector and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) focusing on consumers and the environment.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/china-bans-plastic-waste-whats-next-for-recycling-in-singapore-10281026"}, {"datetime": "03 Jun 2018 10:37AM", "tags": ["Singapore", "Malaysia", "defence"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore, Malaysia agree to strengthen bilateral defence relationship", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore and Malaysia affirmed warm and long-standing defence relations, as the countries' defence ministers met on Sunday (Jun 3), a press release from Singapore's Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said.

This number is expected to go beyond 100,000 by 2030, as Singapore grapples with a burgeoning ageing population. 100,000 isn’t merely a statistic. Behind this number is a challenging story of the human condition, for stats belie the lives and faces affected by this condition, especially loved ones playing the role of caregivers. Think about the mounting pressure faced by caregivers on a daily basis as they deal with cognitive and psychological symptoms so unpredictable that it is hard to put on a brave front while they watch their loved ones fade away. THE ROAD TO DIAGNOSIS People generally view dementia as a normal part of ageing, that as you age, memory is just an element that fades. On the contrary, as of recent, we see more young-onset cases – more individuals below 65 are being diagnosed with dementia.  It is often hard to grasp the condition of dementia. The brain is a complex matter. It is something we cannot touch or see physically.  The early signs of dementia are often misread as signs of depression. My father was on anti-depressants for over two years. It was not until he had a momentary lapse in memory and went missing on a business trip, that we realised it was more than just depression.  He was always staying at the same hotel and would meet his colleagues when he arrived. However, this time, he was nowhere to be found. His colleagues combed the area looking for him and eventually found him in a different hotel on the opposite end of the street.  He could recall that he needed to be on that street, but not where the exact hotel was, even though it was a routine business trip that he had went on for years. Consequently, we sent him to get tests and scans done before the doctors diagnosed him with young-onset dementia. As a family, it was imperative that we took note of the signs and symptoms. More importantly, we learnt to trust our instincts. Likewise, it is absolutely vital for families who are affected to muster the courage to have conversations within the family about sensitive topics such as changes in a loved one’s memory or behaviour.  As soon as early signs become apparent, a timely diagnosis should be conducted. This is often a difficult step for a family to take because dementia can be a frightening word most of us never want to hear associated with our loved ones. But an early diagnosis will give the family time to come to terms with the condition, plan and discuss the options on how to care for a loved one. Start bringing topics like the Mental Capacity Act and the appointment of a Lasting Power of Attorney to the table early. Discuss how your loved one would like to be cared for when they can no longer make decisions on their own. Don’t wait until the signs become too extreme to be ignored, as that can also mean that the condition has progressed. DEMENTIA AND CAREGIVING ISN’T STRAIGHTFORWARD When the issue of dementia hits home, families are often at a loss. Emotional stress might be exacerbated by a lack of clarity of a loved one’s condition, a lack of knowledge on finding credible information, or a lack of guidance on who to speak to for support. Caregiving is hard work and can have psychosocial and physical health effects. Caring for a loved one with dementia is a 24-7 duty. It requires constant deciphering of new and sometimes challenging behaviours exhibited by the individual they are caring for. In addition to the primary stressors of caring such as the patient characteristics and care situation, work interference, financial strain, and sometimes family conflicts can add on as secondary stressors as well. There is a certain stigma to being labelled a caregiver. Many individuals equate it to added responsibilities and the pressure to deliver based on their role. But caregiving is not tagged to a single person. Every individual in the family plays a role in the journey of caring - no matter big or small. As a family member, one may be the bearer of information or solutions while another may be involved in the physical part of caring. We all play an integral role in the family structure to support one another in this caregiving journey. HUMANISATION OF DEMENTIA AND A CAREGIVER’S JOURNEY With dementia, there is an even greater need to shift toward a person-centred care approach. We cannot apply a one-size fits all solution because every individual is different. For instance, character, preference, income level, and speed of progression differs from person to person. One may have different ways to address their emotional stress. Hence, caregiving has to be tailored according to an individual’s needs and preferences to establish a meaningful connection with a loved one. Despite the lack of recreational services for persons with dementia, there are creative options. We have heard of families sending their parents living with dementia for drumming classes because they used to enjoy drumming at a younger age. Some have also engaged with their father through Poker cards because that was what he enjoyed in his 20s - although he has not touched poker in the last 30 years. The opportunities to connect are endless but only possible if you understand your loved one well. Towards the later stages of my dad’s condition, we would often find him sitting and staring into space with the TV running in the background. He was there physically, but it felt like he was no longer present with us. I thought that having to sit through the day listening to television advertisements must be painful. So, I created a mixtape and started playing all his favourite tunes - a combination of The Carpenters, The Beatles, and Elvis Presley. We saw him light up. He wasn’t able to articulate the lyrics but was able to shake his hands and feet to the tune. Capturing that moment of clarity was beautiful, to know he was still there. All we needed to do was to find the right forms of engagement. As caregivers, we can get caught up in the process of caring that we sometimes forget to take notice of the condition’s progression over time and how we can adapt our caregiving methods to those changes. We don’t know what we don’t know. Researching feasible solutions that match what we need may often seem like a never-ending task. Sometimes, all we need is for someone to hold our hand, and point us to the right tools, methods, services, or activities. STIGMA AND SUPPORT Society's mindset is very fixated on the last stages of the condition. When you think of dementia, you often associate its features with the end stage. You think of an individual wandering and going missing, or someone who isn’t able to engage because of his cognitive decline. We need to realise that people with dementia can live well, often for years. They are able to retain a sense of self-awareness and should not be defined exclusively by the condition. If we can change the way people look at dementia, patient caregiving, and talk openly about these growing issues, we can make a big difference in people’s lives. At the end of the day, it really is about being a more gracious society. It is about increasing awareness and empathy so that if you meet someone in the community who needs help, you aren’t afraid to step up to offer that extra hand.

It was seen as a profession of folks who could not get on in life, ex-cons or people who are jobless, drug addicts and all that. “There were gangster stories about how hawkers were fighting with the authorities as they were cleaning up the streets.” However, he saw them quite differently as he was growing up. “I’m not perfect also and I believe in what people do, not what they did and if somebody can put out that perfect platter of pleasure for the masses, something has to be right about that person.” Today, the 56-year-old food consultant, photographer, writer and television host, who is best known for creating the popular hawker food guide Makansutra in 1998, promotes food culture through specialised events such as The World Street Food Congress that have garnered him international fame in culinary circles.  To listen to the full interview, click here.  The New York Times hails him as a “food guide maven” and CNN calls him the “Guru of Grub”.  He is also the owner and operator of Makansutra Gluttons Bay which offers Singapore’s favourite street food in one location. As more and more pioneer hawkers retire or pass on without passing on their skills, Mr Seetoh is growing increasingly worried. He sees hawker food as the most important aspect of Singapore's identity. “The migrant generation came and created it because they had to survive and ingenuity made this food culture of ours.” There's a faraway look in his eyes as he proceeds to speak passionately about the early years of Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. “Back in Hainan, everybody served poached chicken with rice and a ginger dip.” He explains how this evolved here into rice cooked with chicken stock that boasts an intense flavour. The chilli sauce that goes along with it “is non-existent in Hainan”, he points out. Today, he says, Singapore’s Hainananese chicken rice is being “re-exported” to Hainan and it’s something to be proud of. “I’VE NEVER FOLLOWED THE RULES” Over the years, he has sought to showcase hawkers who are often underrated through several TV programmes such as Makansutra Raw and The Food Surprise that have made him a household name in Singapore and other parts of Asia. His signature irreverent presentation style has made him stand out among other food show hosts. He confesses that he has never been “normal”. “I’ve never followed the rules. I always take the other fork in the road.” One could say he’s been this way since childhood. He went to what are considered prestigious schools - St Michael’s Primary and St Joseph's Institution - before going to a vocational institute. “I was supposed to go to college, university and all that, but I struggled with studies. I’m one of those for whom learning what one plus one equals, doesn’t do it. It just didn’t feel right. But I thought there must be something right about me.” He embarked on creative pursuits at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute. He learnt graphic design, photography and advertising. “The creative side of my mind could settle in and I enjoyed it.” I ask him if the stigma of studying in a vocational institute, especially in the late 70s or early 80s, bothered him. “Yeah, there was a stigma, but I didn’t see it like that. I had very, very good years there. I played football there, I had friends who were like-minded.” The first job he was offered was as a graphic designer, but he rejected it to work as a photojournalist at a local newspaper. “That job really shaped my thinking. Every day, we were out seeing, touching, hearing, photographing things.” It made him realise that experiencing things was the best way to learn. “In schools today, they say they want to do away with rote learning. But have they really put it to action? Implementation is the hardest. You’ve got to let students out in the real world. You’ve got to release these fish from their cosy cages and let them touch and see the real world. Let them get an idea of what the real tomorrow is going to be because what you learn today is irrelevant tomorrow. Don’t teach them how to change. Let them decide how they want to change. That’s how teaching should be.” CHAR KWAY TEOW IS A “PORTAL”, “NOT JUST A DISH” While he encourages unconventional approaches to education, when it comes to food, he seems like a traditionalist. It was this that ignited his fire to advocate the preservation of Singapore’s culinary heritage. “It just clicked for me one day. I looked at a plate of char kway teow and I realised that it’s a portal. It’s not just a dish. That plate of char kway teow is actually a portal into a world of education, culture, tourism, entrepreneurial opportunities, all in one plate. “If you’ve mastered cooking that dish, you can be an entrepreneur. Through that dish, you can learn about the Teochews. I learnt about the “Silk Road of char kway teow” because it has a version in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. That’s history and culture. In terms of tourism, it’s obvious. Don’t we enjoy taking our friends from around the world to eat a plate of char kway teow when they’re here?” It was this realisation that made him want to dedicate his life to food. But he is well aware of the possibility that such food may not exist in the near future. Recently, the death of Hill Street Fried Kway Teow founder, Mr Ng Chang Siang, was on his mind. “Do you know how many people Mr Ng has pleased over the decades? People just went there without thinking, ate it and felt comforted by his char kway teow. It’s an unspoken culture in our food. It’s good that his son has taken over he was actually quite reluctant at first.” According to Mr Seetoh, it was years of encouragement that led to the younger Mr Ng, Yeow Kiat’s decision to embrace the profession. “I was telling him he had to continue as his father was getting old and sick. Then people came, started giving him feedback, started giving him recognition. We invited them to do the Singapore Day in London events. Recognition is very important.” THE YOUNG GIVE UP TOO EASILY But few want to do this job because it is seen as a hard slog. Also, over the years, many more attractive and higher-status job opportunities in other sectors have opened up for Singaporeans, He remarks that even among those who do enter the business, many unrealistically expect instant recognition. “Some of them think, “Maybe Gordon Ramsay will come and eat at my stall and I will be famous.’ They’ll tell me, ‘I am the son of so-and-so and I’m taking over. Can you tell all your bloggers, writers and influencer friends to come?’ When they are not spun into the sparkling limelight, they give up. They quit within three months.” He claims he has seen this happen too many times. But he has met a few who are genuine and patiently put in the work. “They say, ‘It’s what I want to do. I ditched my degree, I ditched my previous job to do this'.\" I ask him what he thinks can be done to encourage more to commit to the business. It’s an issue that is receiving the Government’s attention too. In fact, a few years ago, the Government convened a Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee which came up with a list of recommendations to attract more to the hawker trade. The National Environment Agency (NEA) and the People’s Association have introduced the Hawker Fare Series of culinary classes with each class conducted by veteran hawkers. The NEA and Institute of Technical Education jointly developed the Introduction to Managing a Hawker Business course.   A One-Stop Information and Service Centre which provides information such as the various types of equipment that can help in food preparation and contacts for suppliers of raw ingredients, was also set up. One of the most important initiatives is the Incubation Stall Programme for aspiring hawkers. They would have to attend the Introduction to Managing a Hawker Business course or equivalent courses, submit a business plan to the NEA and undergo a food tasting evaluation before they qualify. Under the programme, they are offered a stall for six months at half of the assessed market rent. The stalls also come pre-fitted with basic equipment so that applicants’ start-up costs are greatly reduced. “THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STAY OUT OF THIS” One would think such efforts to keep the hawker trade alive would be lauded by advocates like Mr Seetoh. I’m surprised when he says otherwise. “I think the Government should stay out of this. They are not fit. They are not qualified,” he says definitively. I ask him to explain his statements. “Because they’re only throwing money at you. Hawker work is tough. Just because the Government wants to incubate you, doesn’t mean this job is easy.  You have to cook well, know how to reach people, know how to cook a hundred portions an hour and so on. A short course is not enough and pumping money into the industry to fire this up may not be helpful. It gives people the impression that it is so easy. They say, ‘Let's go and do a ‘try, try’ thing’. It’s easy to walk out when you are funded by somebody else’s money, but if it’s your own and you realise that this is good, this is what you really want to do, it’s a different story.” I suggest that if the Government stopped these initiatives, it would be even harder to keep the trade going. Even the ones who currently try may not consider it. “Let’s attract the real ones. I'd rather encourage you to come out on your own because that will be more organic and you will be in it not because you got funding. It’s your own money. It’s your own belief. Go and learn as an apprentice. Go and work for a hawker for one year. The hawker may or may not teach you everything, but if you have slightly more than half a brain, you will be able to figure out the entire story and do it on your own later.  \"If you just take some funding and go for some Government programmes, you will still wind up with not much. The more successful newer-generation hawkers are those who came out on their own and they are still around despite the failures. They took time to learn. They didn’t fall the minute they came across the first wall.\" What would he suggest to encourage more such hawkers then? “It’s the same story as in the past. People went into the hawker business back in the day because they were desperate. Today, I think there’s more reason for you to be desperate again. A lot of jobs are going to the machines, the computers and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Maybe food is something AI cannot fully take over because people are spoilt with the pleasure of artisanal food.” But even though consumers enjoy hawker food, in some quarters, being a hawker is still seen as a profession that lacks status. “If we enjoy food, we can’t see it that way. It’s a very noble profession today. If you can think about it: ‘Wow, hey, maybe I like to dredge up this food that I believe in and love and I know that I’ve got a story to tell about this food and I want to sell and tell. And I want to go out and do it because it makes me happy and  because I know I can generate some money from this'.\" “LET THIS FOOD CULTURE DIE” I’m sceptical about whether enough people will realise this on their own, but he reiterates the Government should “stay out of this”. \"Just give people very good, reasonable rents and tell them where to get their supplies. Let them figure out on their own how to be good, how to be better.\" Often, the issue of rent is raised as a hurdle to hawkers’ success. However, the NEA has taken a few measures to stabilise rents. This includes disallowing subletting and not setting a reserve rent when tendering out vacant stalls. In July last year, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said that rental rates at NEA hawker centres remain in check. The average successful tender bid for cooked food stalls over the three years leading up to her statement had been $1,370 per month, with bids ranging from S$1 to S$4,888. Mr Seetoh believes that more can be done to ensure even lower rents. If even under the right conditions, the traditional hawker food scene doesn’t flourish, “so be it”, he says. \"If it doesn’t happen organically, then let this food culture die. Then let the soil rot and let new shoots come out. Burn the whole forest down. Right now, the future looks bleak, but I still believe down the road there will be some kind of a sub-culture coming up. Somebody will realise that it’s not just about running a food stall. You can become the world's best one-dish entrepreneur and your hawker store concept can go worldwide.\" In the meantime, he offers would-be hawkers something to aspire to. “I will tell you how to get into it, who you can meet, who you can talk to and get into it because you love the food culture that you grew up with. It is very sexy.  I just came back from New York and one of the biggest food markets, street food players down there who has hawker stores, pop-up hawkers – he’s the only vendor in the entire United  States who’s been given permission to set up pop-up stores in the heart of Times Square. 20 to 30 million people traverse that area and that guy was saying, ‘I would love to have some Singapore hawkers.’ Imagine you are selling chicken rice balls in Times Square or nasi lemak packs and people talk about you. Those are very, very worthwhile goals.\" He’s quick to urge patience though. “Don’t expect success overnight.” \"HIPSTER FOOD IS NOT FOOD\" As more hawker centres are built to cater to changing tastes, Mr Seetoh cautions against going overboard. While he laud efforts to automate certain functions, such as dishwashing, to keep manpower costs down in newer hawker centres, he doesn’t agree with the hipster feel that some have and other initiatives to inject vibrancy into the centres through events such as musical performances, digital art showcase, interactive games and art and music workshops. “It’s irritating. When I eat, please shut up. I’ll give you S$5 for you to shut up. “I feel hawker centres should be comfortable, but there's no need to be fancy or hipster in terms of design. This takes away from the fact that you are selling food. It also shows desperation when you put on concerts and talks to attract people.  Make sure the food is good and ventilate the hawker centre well, make it more comfortable. That’s all people want.” He also attacks the many young hawkers who have started serving up hipster cuisine. “Hipster food is not food,\" he declares.  \"With hipster food, you target the millennials who are not loyal. They will come once or twice, take a nice picture, post it on instagram and they won’t come back. You have to remember that millennials are people too and all people ultimately love good food. The traditional fare, if done well, will keep them and everyone else coming back. Focus on the food. “Hipster food like putting curry in a waffle cone is also not going to attract tourists. The tourists want to eat char kway teow, hokkien mee, bak chor mee - stuff they can’t pronounce. If you always focus on new, new, new, I think the Singapore food culture will die within 10 years.” When I remark that he might be too much of a purist, he clarifies that he doesn’t object to traditional food being infused with new elements. “If you start putting giant prawns or lobster in your noodles, I wouldn’t fault you. Because you are still expressing who you are and if you are using fancier produce, you’re placing it nicely, serving it in a nicer environment, I won’t fault you because you’re still expressing who you are.” A COMMITMENT TO TEACHING AND LEARNING In order to keep this going, veteran hawkers have to be willing to teach. He claims he has heard that many of them are reluctant to do so fully even when they are paid to do so. “The full recipes are not taught.” But should we expect veteran hawkers to give their recipes away so easily? “Yeah, we shouldn’t, but at least teach them the thinking behind the recipe, the taste notes, tell them about the techniques that go into the cooking and inspire the younger ones to come up with even better things.” The younger ones, on their part, need to be patient and inquisitive when learning, he says. Hawkers tell him it can take several years to perfect a dish. “Beyond that, you need to know how to design a stall, how to promote, how to scale, how to trend. All these are very, very important. Also, if you want to expand, who do you look for when you go overseas.” He used to conduct such programmes to help would-be hawkers, and intends to do so again in the near future. In the meantime, he continues to spread the stories of Singapore’s heritage cuisine far and wide and gain exposure for Singapore’s hawkers through special events. I ask him if he has ever considered cooking for a living. It’s something that has crossed his mind, but he loves what he’s doing today and intends to continue. “I still have some energy left to do what I love doing. So one day, maybe as a retirement project, I will come out and be the next hipster hawker,” he says with a raucous laugh.  When forced to get serious, he says he “will go back to tradition”. “I think in 10 years, old food will be new again and put on a nicer plate maybe. I’ll sell you char kway teow and chicken rice with fancier cuts of meat and better ingredients.” Today, his focus on preventing the death of Singapore hawker cuisine remains unstinting as he encourages younger hawkers to continue our traditions. “I want to make people realise that the pleasure of eating is not just a function. It is about who we are. The pleasure of eating can be heightened if we realise this and I want to help people enjoy this journey a whole lot more.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/kf-seetoh-makansutra-singapore-hawker-food-on-the-record-10299626"}, {"datetime": "03 Jun 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["Ramadan", "migrant workers", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Ray Yeh", "title": "'My heart cries': Muslim migrant workers ache for family, but find support from bosses this Ramadan", "content": " SINGAPORE: When Kadir Mohammad Abdul first arrived in Singapore seven years ago, he spent his nights crying. Then 26, the young father would call his family in Bangladesh in the evening, but make no mention of his misery to his parents, wife or children.  Though once the calls ended, tears flowed. “Why did I come to Singapore?” was the question he repeatedly asked himself. Like the thousands of migrant labourers who come to Singapore each year, life as a construction worker in the city state was not what he had expected it to be. Before he left home, friends and relatives who had worked in Singapore told of a dream city where the roads were clean, people were friendly, and everyone followed the law.  Above all, they spoke of a better life with better-paying jobs. Although all of those things turned out to be somewhat true, it was what they had failed to bring up that was Kadir’s grievance. “Singapore really is a dream country. But for workers, it is different,” he said. “Workers wake up at 6am to go to work. Come back at 11pm (after working overtime). After showering, praying and makan, it’s midnight. It means six hours of rest.  “That’s why we are not feeling the dream.” SIX RAMADANS AWAY FROM HOME Other than the long hours and physical demands, Kadir - who has a master’s degree in Islamic Studies - also feared going to work because he could not understand some supervisors who, as a result of miscommunication, often got mad at him for not following instructions. “My previous company was a Chinese company,” he explained. “I spoke English and Bengali, they didn’t understand. When they talked in Chinese, I didn’t understand. Supervisors sometimes got very angry. My life was very difficult.” Language complications are commonly faced by many newly-arrived migrant workers. To end his misery, Kadir harboured thoughts of going home, even though he knew it wasn't really an option. Farming jobs in Comilla where he came from would not earn him enough to support a growing family. And on top of that, he had debts to clear. To secure a job in Singapore, workers like Kadir who had no referral have to go through recruitment agencies in Bangladesh that typically charge between S$5,000 and S$10,000 in fees. To pay those agents, workers borrow large sums from banks or acquaintances. Their earnings from the first year or two in Singapore go towards repaying those loans. Fortunately for Kadir, the situation at work improved as he learnt the ropes. He even approached a manager who could speak English and suggested: “My understanding is a big problem. You can teach me how to say things in Mandarin. Then I can translate for you (to other workers).” Kadir’s newfound confidence and industry gradually earned him the trust of his managers and coworkers. He rose through the ranks and is now a senior worker. But there is one thing he still constantly yearns for: His family. When he left home in 2012, his son was only three years old and his daughter, one. His wife gave birth to their third child six months after he moved to Singapore. Now, his children are aged 10, eight and six. Daily calls home make him miss them more. And these feelings of homesickness only intensify during occasions like Ramadan and Hari Raya Puasa. It has been six long years since he last celebrated Ramadan with his family. This Eid al-Fitr, he will once again remain in Singapore, away from his wife and children. WATCH: Of sacrifices, faith and brotherhood (7:55)  FAMILY OF BROTHERS At the intersection of Bukit Timah Expressway and Mandai Road, not far from Mandai Hill Army Camp and the Singapore Zoo, is Mandai Lodge 1. This gated dormitory is where Kadir and almost 2,000 other construction workers retire after a long day at work. Each dorm room houses 12 workers. These men from Bangladesh, India and China share facilities such as TV rooms, a laundry room, a gym and a basketball court. There is also a canteen, a grocery store and a barbershop. But at the heart of their communal experience is the two-storey cookhouse. Rows of gas stoves and sinks cater to the cooking needs of all the hungry labourers.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This is where most days start and end for Kadir and his coworkers, especially during Ramadan. They typically have breakfast here at around 6am, their meals usually consisting of rice and fish or chicken curry. By 6.30am, they would be on the company shuttle to the work site.  Their labour ends at 7pm or 10pm, depending on whether there is urgent work to be done. And when they return to the dormitory, they cook. Kadir moved to Mandai Lodge 1 last year after he joined Chian Teck Realty, a local SME. At 33, he is the big brother to a small group of mostly younger Bangladeshi coworkers. “There are people from different districts here, but we feel like we are from the same family,” said Hosen Sahadat, 28, who has lived in Singapore for five years. The youngest of the lot is Abul Hosen, 26. He came to Singapore three years ago and is currently a general worker. Junior workers like him typically take home about S$800 a month; Abul says he sends home about S$600. His dream is to send his parents on the pilgrimage to Mecca. “Many times when I lie in bed at night, I remember my parents back home,” he said. “I feel really bad especially when I think of my mother, but there is nothing I can do.” As someone who has gone through it all, Kadir often uses himself as an example to spur his younger friends on. “I show them that I work hard, and that’s why I now have my position. If you follow me, you can also have your dream position. Everybody can do it,” he stressed. At Chian Teck, Kadir works as a safety coordinator. He was asked to join the company last year by Xu Tian Cheng, one of its project managers who'd met Kadir two years ago on another project and thought him a \"very responsible guy\". Tian Cheng recalled the incident that made him decide to hire Kadir. “At construction sites, we have waste bins that get counted by the trip, so whether you fill them up 70 or 100 per cent, they charge you one trip,” he explained. “Even though Kadir was in charge of safety, he made sure his colleagues filled up the bins totally. That’s what I saw, and that’s why I thought he was the right guy for us.\" SAFETY FIRST, ESPECIALLY WHILE FASTING The team is currently working on Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ), a mixed development by property developer Lendlease that consists of office towers, a shopping mall and a condominium.  As the safety lead at one of the PLQ plots, Kadir is dead serious when it comes to his duties. “I want everybody to go back the same - meaning two hands, two legs and two eyes. If anyone does unsafe work, immediately we stop them.  I remind them that their father, mother and children are waiting for them.  \"Or if they are single, I ask them how they are going to get married with only one hand or one eye. Cannot, right?” he laughed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the fasting month of Ramadan, extra precautions are put in place by Lendlease to ensure the health and safety of Muslim workers at PLQ. They make up over 70 per cent of the workforce on site. “There’s a heightened awareness for us for this period, when there are risks associated with being in a very hot working environment and not eating or drinking throughout,” says Richard Paine, managing director of PLQ. Workers always work in pairs during this period so that they can keep a look out for each other.  They also wear helmets with stickers that state \"I’m fasting\", so that supervisors can easily identify them and assign them less strenuous tasks. Where possible, workers can also request to work night shifts to avoid doing laborious tasks while on fast. On a personal level, if conditions get tough, some workers do break their fast and make up for it on another day. “On the second day of Ramadan, I couldn’t fast, it was difficult,” said Islam Shohidul, who has been in the country for four years. “I work with panels. When I cut them, they release dust that goes into the nose and it makes me feel very thirsty.\" But while Ramadan is often associated with the physical discomfort of hunger and thirst, the rewards it brings to those who observe the faith are seen as fulfilling. Kadir especially enjoys breaking fast on site at sundown with fellow Muslim workers and non-Muslim colleagues. Iftar meals during this period are provided by Chian Teck. “Our company culture is like this. Boss said, last time our company was very small. But when we come here to work and support the company, the company also takes care of us,” Kadir said.  We are one contractor, one family, that’s why we eat together and work together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “PAPA, WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?” Indeed, for Kadir and men like him, their Singapore family consists of coworkers with whom they spend almost every waking hour. Many of them also have blood relatives - brothers, cousins, uncles - who work in other parts of Singapore, and together they form the extended family. Sunday is when these families gather, usually at Little India where they feel most at ease. During Ramadan, they can seen breaking fast together, picnic style, on pavements around the precinct. After the meal, they pray before they go shopping at Mustafa. But even when he is surrounded by his Singapore family, his parents, wife and children back in Bangladesh are never far from Kadir’s mind. “Now I have money. But I go shopping by myself,” he said. “In my country, during Ramadan, whole family goes to the shopping mall together. My father, mother, my wife and baby children, my brother and my best friend, everybody in one car.  When I think of this, my heart cries. Kadir was planning to go home for Eid this year, but had to reschedule due to unfinished work at PLQ - which is due to be completed in phases from the second half of this year. “When I called my small baby, she said, ‘Papa, when are you coming back? I’m waiting for you.’ And then they sometimes cry. “They would ask me, ‘Another uncle is coming back, why are you not coming home?’ I would tell them, ‘I already sent you money, you can go shopping with your mother.’ They’d say, ‘No, I’m not happy with mother, I want you.’  “When they talk like this, it really pains my heart. I cannot tahan.” Kadir said he plans to head home for good when he hits the 10-year mark in Singapore. “For me, money is not the most important thing. I’ve seen other men return to Bangladesh when they are old, and they are too weak to enjoy the time with their family. I don’t want to be like that,” he said.

Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said it is “particularly appropriate” that the MOU was signed this year, given the historical ties both countries share and that Singapore is gearing up to mark the 200th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles’ landing on the island. Dr Ng also noted the “warm and long-standing” bilateral defence relationship.  Earlier on Saturday, Dr Ng signed an enhanced defence cooperation agreement with German's Federal Minister of Defence Dr Ursula von der Leyen.  It builds on the existing pact signed in 2005, and paves the way for future cooperation in non-conventional security areas like cybersecurity and hybrid attacks.  “We signed the first DCA (Defence Cooperation Agreement) between Singapore and Germany in 2005.

Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran, who unveiled the blueprint on Saturday (Jun 2), said the document comprises of strategies and recommendations made by the Digital Readiness Workgroup, which was convened last year. The 16-strong workgroup was led by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport, and included officers from MCI, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, as well as private sector executives from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and DBS Bank. Representatives from Singapore Polytechnic, SG Enable and Touch Community Services round off the group. “This blueprint … contains recommendations around providing widespread access to technology, driving digital literacy, encouraging everyone to play a part in strengthening digital readiness and hardcoding digital inclusion into the design of all processes and services,” Dr Janil said in the foreword of the document. The 10 recommendations by the workgroup are: VERNACULAR LANGUAGES FOR MORE DIGITAL SERVICES In a multiracial, multilingual society like Singapore, the workgroup pointed out that “language can sometimes be one of the key barriers to the understanding, acceptance and adoption of anything, including technology”. As such, it stressed that relevant services, whether it is an app, a workshop or publicity materials, should be communicated and implemented in vernacular languages to reach out to non-English-speaking Singaporeans, especially the elderly. Machine translation could also be used where possible to make apps more usable to those who speak only vernacular languages, it added. The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) had in November last year unveiled the National Speech Corpus, an example of an artificial intelligence (AI) library, to “support and enhance the accuracy of speech recognition engines” here. While the effort to offer vernacular languages is not new, the workgroup stressed that Singaporeans should be given the option of transacting and using digital services in their mother tongue languages, particularly for common tools like communication apps and more regularly used digital government services.  HELPING “DIGITAL NON-NATIVES” As for the one-on-one assistance recommendation, the workgroup said they see a need to provide greater support for “digital non-natives” on the use of such devices or services. The IMDA and National Library Board (NLB) have some initiatives today to assist seniors and mature adults in navigating the technology landscape. MCI had, for instance, mentioned in this year’s Committee of Supply debates that under IMDA’s Silver Infocomm Initiative, digital clinics and experiential learning journeys will be made available to the elderly to try their hand at technology. In tandem with these, the workgroup recommended a “dedicated and regular avenue through which the public can obtain one-on-one concierge-type assistance” on the use of digital devices or services. This can be offered at common social gathering points like community clubs, public libraries and senior activity centres, and staff there can help impart basic digital skills, it added. A MCI spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that the intention for this recommended assistance is intended to be a permanent avenue in the long term, and the operational model is being discussed by the relevant agencies. It will be piloted at selected community clubs by the fourth quarter of this year, the spokesperson added. It also suggested that more emphasis be placed on helping citizens living in mature estates that have higher proportions of seniors. Madam Saw Geok Choo, an 80-year-old who does not live with her family, was held up as an example in the blueprint. She received a new smartphone from her daughter, but did not have anyone to easily turn to for help in using the device and did not want to trouble others to find out more. She later learnt about IMDA’s digital clinic from her friend and attended one in May this year, which proved useful as she learnt how to check for bus arrival timings and transfer photos from her old phone to the new. What, then, is the end goal now that the blueprint is revealed? The Government said its digital readiness efforts are directed at ensuring four “strategic outcomes”: That every Singaporean has the means to transact digitally, has the skills, confidence and motivation to use technology, makes use of technology to achieve a better quality of life and every digital product or service is designed for easy and intuitive use. \"The heart of the nation is our people,\" Mr Iswaran said.  \"And we want to ensure that all Singaporeans can thrive and lead fulfilling lives in a digital era, using technology as a critical enabler.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-launches-first-digital-readiness-blueprint-with-10312390"}, {"datetime": "02 Jun 2018 12:55PM", "tags": ["media literacy", "digital readiness blueprint", "deliberate online falsehoods"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "New framework mooted to combat online scams, misinformation in Singapore", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new common framework to incorporate the various information and media literacy initiatives currently available is being developed to build up Singaporeans’ resilience against online scams and deliberate online falsehoods.  This was announced by Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran on Saturday (Jun 2) when he unveiled Singapore's first Digital Readiness Blueprint. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) told Channel NewsAsia separately that a national info and media literacy framework will bring together existing programmes by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), National Library Board (NLB), Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the Media Literacy Council (MLC). These programmes include the Better Internet Campaign, Cyber Awareness Campaign and SURE (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate). This common framework will help guide public education efforts as well as to ensure consistency in public messaging and communications, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added: “The digital age offers both tremendous opportunities and also risks, as can be seen with the proliferation of fake news, videos and so on. Public education has been identified as a bulwark to tackle the issue, and part of that will involve stepping up efforts to bolster information and media literacy skills. “We hope that through a concerted approach, we will contribute towards raising scepticism of misinformation in the short to intermediate term and a more informed and resilient community against such online falsehoods in the longer term,” the spokesperson said. The framework is being developed by MCI in collaboration with IMDA, NLB and CSA. On Saturday, Mr Iswaran unveiled the country's first Digital Readiness Blueprint that addressed the issue of information and media literacy and contained other strategies and recommendations made by the Digital Readiness Workgroup. One of the recommendations called for the provision of customised resources including how to discern online falsehoods. “These resources should be made readily accessible, and carry information that is easily understood,” the document stated. “This includes making sure that the resources are made available in Singapore’s four main languages to reach out to non-English speakers too.” The issue of deliberate online falsehoods was put under the microscope earlier this year when a Select Committee led by Deputy Speaker Charles Chong was convened and a host of experts and industry stakeholders were invited to give their views in writing as well as during the eight-day public hearing.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-framework-mooted-to-combat-online-scams-misinformation-in-10312838"}, {"datetime": "02 Jun 2018 12:36PM", "tags": ["North Korea", "defence"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "South Korea says US-North Korea summit a 'precious opportunity' for global peace and prosperity", "content": " SINGAPORE: The potential success of the upcoming United States-North Korea summit in Singapore is a “precious opportunity” for peace and prosperity in the world, South Korea Defence Minister Song Young-moo said on Saturday (Jun 2). “If the upcoming summit is a success, then we will have a precious opportunity for peace and prosperity in Asia-Pacific and the world,” he said. Mr Song was speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore hours after US President Donald Trump confirmed that the historic summit was back on. Mr Trump had announced this following a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s right-hand man at the White House on Friday, only a week after he abruptly cancelled the summit in a sharply worded letter. Nevertheless, Mr Song said the international community had high praise for Mr Trump’s effort in organising the summit, as he hoped for a positive outcome from the meeting scheduled for Jun 12. “I hope President Trump and Chairman Kim come to a historical agreement for complete denuclearisation and complete peace on the Korean Peninsula,” he said. “On multiple occasions, Chairman Kim has declared a desire for complete denuclearisation, and President Trump to end hostilities and achieve economic cooperation.” RARE OPPORTUNITY Mr Song compared the US-North Korea meeting to the Malta Summit in 1989, which marked an end to the Cold War between US and the former Soviet Union. “This is a rare opportunity and we must be successful this time,” he said. The defence chief acknowledged that international efforts to achieve denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula had failed before, as he pledged to spare no effort and learn from past mistakes. “To achieve more tangible results, what we need is an honest dialogue to find a rational solution between the leaders of the US and North Korea,” he added. Beyond that, the success of the summit is also dependent on “consistent support” from the international community, Mr Song said. “We urge them to stand united in our diplomatic efforts to ensure North Korea advances on the path of denuclearisation.” However, Japan’s Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera took a far more cautious approach to the summit, as he warned of Pyongyang’s history of reneging on promises. “In light of how North Korea behaved in the past, it’s important not to reward North Korea solely for having dialogue,” he told delegates after Mr Song’s speech. “The only way for peace is ensuring they take concrete action.” To that end, Mr Onodera said the international community must continue to maintain “maximum pressure” on North Korea to ensure it dismantles all weapons of mass destruction, repeating a phrase Mr Trump used after initially cancelling the summit. These weapons include all ranges of ballistic missiles, chemical and biological weapons, Mr Onodera added, highlighting how Pyongyang’s missile tests have often put Japan under threat. And even if North Korea shows it is taking concrete steps to denuclearise, Mr Onodera said the international community must take subsequent inspections and verifications seriously. “Defence authorities need to remain wary,” he stated. A NEW ERA While Mr Song admitted that Pyongyang has fooled Seoul before, he said continued suspicion means “we will never come to an agreement”. “Our new leaders are looking to open a new era,” he said in a question-and-answer session afterwards. “Please understand that.” Mr Song said Seoul dreams of a peaceful Korean Peninsula without war, noting that a nuclearised peninsula is a “grave and pressing concern” for the regional security environment. “We ask for close cooperation from the international community to realise this dream,” he added. “We know the path will not be an easy one, but we just want to make full use of this precious opportunity to achieve our outcome.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/south-korea-says-trump-kim--summit-opportunity-for-peace-10329590"}, {"datetime": "02 Jun 2018 12:10PM", "tags": [], "author": "", "title": "Japan, South Korea spar on engaging Kim Jong Un in dialogue", "content": " SINGAPORE: Japan's Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said on Saturday (Jun 2) it was important not to reward North Korea for only agreeing to dialogue and it must take concrete action to dismantle all of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His South Korean counterpart urged support for dialogue to help North Korea join the international community, saying its leader Kim Jong Un must be given the benefit of the doubt. The apparent divergence of views between the US allies come ahead of a planned summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump on Jun 12 in Singapore to discuss ending the North's nuclear weapons program. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue security forum in Singapore, Onodera said North Korea had entered into agreements to end its nuclear program in the past only to conduct more activities to further their weapons development. \"In light of how North Korea behaved in the past, it is important not to reward it for agreeing to have dialogue,\" Onodera said. The only way to bring peace was to ensure North Korea takes concrete action to end all nuclear programs and the development of ballistic missiles of all ranges, he said. North Korea in 1994 and 2005 signed agreements to end its nuclear weapons program in return for diplomatic and economic rewards, but it went on to conduct the first of its six nuclear tests in 2006, bringing about a series of UN sanctions. The South Korean government of liberal President Moon Jae-in has made it a top priority to engage the North in dialogue to resolve decades-old animosity and bring lasting peace, publicly pledging it would never pursue the collapse of its neighbor. South Korea's defense minister, Song Young-moo, said he recognized there was debate about the extent of the nuclear disarmament that Kim should be made to agree to, but if the focus was on disagreement and not on the way forward, dialogue would never make progress. \"But there must be CVID (complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement), and it must be enforced, and I believe Kim Jong Un will embrace it,\" Song told the forum. \"If you continue to doubt Kim Jong Un's motives, that will only come as an obstacle to dialogue and progress.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/japan-south-korea-spar-on-engaging-kim-jong-un-in-dialogue-10329580"}, {"datetime": "02 Jun 2018 06:48AM", "tags": ["terrorism", "Islamic State", "Shangri-La Dialogue", "ASEAN"], "author": "Muhammad Faizal Abdul Rahman", "title": "Commentary: Blurred lines and new means - terrorism’s alarming new dimensions", "content": " SINGAPORE: Terrorism remains high on the agenda of defence and security organisations worldwide. Indeed, the ongoing Shangri-La Dialogue 2018 in Singapore brings together defence officials to unpack the new dimensions of terrorism and counter-terrorism in its plenary sessions. The dialogue is crucial as current developments attest to the intractable nature of the problem. The annual spring offensive by the Taliban underscores how terrorist groups continue to be a destabilising force in Afghanistan. The war in Yemen and recent launch of the jihadi propaganda outlet “Al-Badr”, named after a fabled battle in AD 624, highlight the longevity of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Suicide attacks committed by jihadi families and the Depok prison riot caused by inmates - both linked to the Islamic State (IS) - in Indonesia in May 2018 demonstrates how IS is far from defeated and evolving from a caliphate into a transnational terrorist movement similar to Al Qaeda. STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN TERRORISM New dimensions of terrorism, the theme of a plenary at the Shangri-La Dialogue, is a pertinent theme because the resilience of jihadi terrorist groups is one of the primary reasons why the world is still struggling to contain the problem 18 years after the 9/11 attacks. For example, the shift in IS’ focus from its diminished position in the Levant to the wider world - cities in non-conflict zones and other restive regions – may reek of desperation but more importantly highlights how IS adapts to counter-terrorism efforts by framing a battlespace that is unencumbered by national borders. This puts more pressure on the approaches that nations currently take to coordinate operations and share intelligence at the international level while upholding their sovereign interests. The interaction of military and civilian targets in the urban environment, given the need for soldiers to support police officers in joint operations to deter and disrupt terrorist attacks, may blur the lines between targets. Furthermore, any public concerns arising from certain socio-political sensitivities over the separation of functions between the military and police may influence counter-terrorism strategies. Geopolitical developments such as the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem has inflamed sentiments of Palestinian victimhood, and by extension sentiments of Muslim victimhood. This risks reinvigorating jihadi narratives, which terrorist groups could espouse to galvanise their supporters and justify domestic attacks against the West, their allies and their interests overseas.  DIFFICULTIES UNFOLD Closer to home, Southeast Asia is seeing new dimensions of terrorism unfolding with no clear solutions in sight.  The ongoing humanitarian crisis in Rakhine state risks engulfing the region in an endless cycle of disenfranchisement that regional terrorist groups could capitalise on to radicalise individuals. The crisis complicates regional security (and humanitarian) cooperation as, firstly, some soldiers there have been accused of abuses, secondly the violence there has given rise to non-jihadi militancy among hardline Buddhist groups, and thirdly whether the crisis is domestic or regional has become a divisive issue. The battle of Marawi may have ended but it revealed how the military may be underprepared for an Aleppo scenario – urban takeover – happening beyond Middle East. Furthermore, Marawi has seen how terrorists can leverage new technologies – consumer drones – to match the capabilities of security forces; and the city is now seeing how rehabilitation – a key effort of counter-terrorism - is potentially becoming an issue of geopolitical rivalry given concerns over the involvement of Chinese construction firms even as the US provides military aid. The series of suicide attacks by jihadi families in Indonesia demonstrates the operational difficulty of gathering intelligence on and intercepting numerous foreign fighters and their radicalised families returning home from the frontlines.  This by extension may give rise to the risk of these individuals surreptitiously crossing the borders to launch attacks in neighbouring countries. Furthermore, security forces would need to gird for increased public scrutiny especially if the use of necessary force to neutralise attackers who are women and children risk inflaming anti-government sentiments, which terrorists could then capitalise on. ASEAN – MULTILATERALISM IS KEY The current trajectory of terrorism increasingly blurs the lines between domestic and international security. For example, IS foreign fighters are combatants that the military must neutralise in the Levant. However, they also constitute social and security challenges when they return home as well as pose a cross-border security threat if they travel through other countries. The situation in Syria shows how big power rivalry between Russia and US may impede counter-terrorism actions at the frontlines, and even feed the terrorist narratives. These issues, if not addressed, would only perpetuate terrorism and frustrate counter-terrorism efforts. These issues cannot be resolved unilaterally or bilaterally, but best addressed through neutral multilateral platforms that facilitate international cooperation in an open and inclusive way. ASEAN is the key regional architecture in East Asia and beyond a “talk shop”; it plays a central role in enabling multilateral platforms that facilitate international counter-terrorism cooperation particularly in raising awareness of emerging terror threats and reducing disparities in counter-terrorism capacity among member countries. Within ASEAN, the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) and ADMM-Plus are key to maintaining good relations that underpin strong defence cooperation in various areas; and engaging external partners such as China and US to build confidence and lower the risk of miscalculations at the frontlines. The ASEAN Political-Security Community, through its Convention on Counter-Terrorism helps strategically in coordinating counter-terrorism policies in the region. It operationally supports counter-terrorism efforts by police forces through better information sharing on its enhanced database and its partnership with other regional police organisations such as EUROPOL. ASEAN member countries should stay united to ensure that the architecture continues to work well and not be blindsided by new dimensions of terrorism. Southeast Asia is high on the jihadi terrorist groups’ agenda given the region’s history of terrorist threats such as Jemaah Islamiyah and Al Qaeda, and more currently groups that are associated with IS. These groups seek to radicalise, manipulate, and divide the Muslim communities here, which make up about 65 per cent of the global Muslim population. Member countries should ensure that the state of their counter-terrorism cooperation keeps pace with the trajectory of terrorism. This would require reviewing existing multilateral initiatives – strategic and operational - and adapting them to suit new dimensions of terrorism. SINGAPORE – NAVIGATING THE WAY FORWARD As the current chair of ASEAN in 2018, Singapore is in a good position to advocate deeper cooperation at the strategic and operational levels among the member countries to keep pace with the new dimensions of terrorism. This position also stems from Singapore’s strong defence relations with its neighbours and external partners, commitment to a rules-based international order; and credibility in the form of a strong Armed Forces (SAF) and effective homeland security organisations. For example, the professional exchange on Urban Operations between the SAF and Philippine Army at the Murai Urban Training Facility in December 2017 marks the blending of Singapore’s state-of-the-art urban operation capabilities and Phillipines’ deep experience in combatting terrorists at the frontlines. Moving forward, ASEAN member states and external partners should work closely with Singapore to sustain good bilateral and multilateral relations, and build confidence among themselves. This would pave the way for deeper counter-terrorism cooperation that is essential to first countering transnational terrorist threats that do not respect national borders, and second adapting existing strategic and operational CT initiatives to suit the changing terrorism landscape.

It replaces UberEats, which the ride-hailing giant had acquired when it took over Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, and will go head-to-head with a slew of food delivery apps.  Among them include foodpanda and Deliveroo, which entered Singapore in 2012 and 2016, respectively.  While the growing food delivery scene has seen various new entrants over the years, Grab’s market stature and deep pockets “will definitely shake up” the industry, said associate professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.  “It is coming from a totally different vantage point,” he explained. “Once Grab is in, the market’s competitive dynamics won’t be the same anymore.”  Echoing that, Mr Samuel Tan, a retail management expert from Temasek Polytechnic’s (TP) School of Business, said Grab is supported by competitive advantages derived from the acquisition of UberEats and its domination of the on-demand transportation market.  “They are building on the large customer base of existing Grab services and UberEats. Food and beverage vendors will be eager to come on board given the established set-up … Additionally, in terms of technological advantages, Grab has its own expertise on top of that from the merger with UberEats.”  Grab also seems “serious about getting a stronghold in the food delivery business” as it steers itself towards the goal of becoming an “everyday app”, said Assoc Prof Loh.  “To be able to attract so many restaurants within two months says something … This is just the beginning and I don’t think they will stop here.” PRICE WAR BREWING? Price will likely be the first battleground for the eager new player aiming for a slice of the market pie and incumbents defending their turfs, experts told Channel NewsAsia.  This boils down to how price-sensitive customers are and the low switching costs involved. “An alternative option is just an app away,” said Assoc Prof Loh.  Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) associate professor Momin Zafar Abdulmajid reckoned “a price war is imminent as Grab looks to build up the size of the business quickly”.  Already, GrabFood has dished out a promo code giving users a S$5 discount for three orders before the end of this week, among other promotions.  When asked if there could be more discount codes in the pipeline, a Grab spokesperson said the company “continually creates new and exciting products, not just on the food delivery front, to ensure that customers always have something new and exciting to look forward it”. Other food delivery players also seem to be gearing up to compete on price.  Apart from a promo code for first-time customers, London-headquartered Deliveroo has sliced its minimum order value from S$18 to S$12 and reduced delivery fees by 50 cents to S$3.  Homegrown online concierge service Honestbee also cut its minimum spend on orders by nearly half to S$8 in April and offers free delivery. “We hope that we’ll be able to entice more customers to try out our food delivery service,” said its Singapore managing director Chris Urban. Over at major player foodpanda, the minimum spend was reduced to S$12 from S$15 in February. When asked if it could do away with that or have promo codes like its rivals, managing director Luc Andreani replied that the company focuses on balancing a long-term business model with “the dynamics of the industry” and is “continuously exploring next steps”. MORE THAN JUST PRICE But market observers were quick to add that while a competition on price could take place in the near term, it would unlikely be sustained as it is a costly undertaking that will ultimately be detrimental to all. “A sustained price war, like what we saw in the ride-hailing scene, will be very bloody,” said Assoc Prof Momin, referring to the bruising battle for market control between Uber and Grab that prioritised aggressive discounts over profits.  Besides, players in the local market still have work to do when it comes to improving efficiency and profitability through the scale of their operations.  “The business is good but to make money, they will need to be of a reasonable size to optimise resources. None of them in Singapore have scaled enough to be that efficient or economical,” said the NTU professor who is experienced in strategy consulting. Food delivery players that Channel NewsAsia spoke to clearly understood that. Mr Andreani stressed that foodpanda’s business philosophy “is not centred around a quick-win burn-based strategy” though being backed by Berlin-based Delivery Hero means that it has “the resources and capabilities to match or better any of the offerings in the market” should it wish to do so.  The oldest player in the food delivery market here said it has signed up more delivery riders and merchants in recent months, as well as replaced UberEats in a rewards programme of e-commerce platform Lazada. Its growth plans also include opening a centralised kitchen with a dine-in concept.  “With the amount of data that we’ve amassed, we are able to successfully predict trends of our users and allows us to better plan for resource allocation to ensure that we operate at an optimal level … With a better understanding, we are able to predict and adjust our promotions accordingly to retain a strong market share and repeat orders.” Growth for the first quarter of 2018 has been a robust 45 per cent, said Mr Andreani. But he declined to reveal specific figures on profitability and would only say that operations in Singapore are “firmly on a path to profitability” that is expected to materialise early next year.  For Deliveroo, while current priorities in Singapore remain on growth, profitability is equally important.  “In the short term because of the competition, we will have promotions but to build a product that consumers want to continue using, it’s a combination of price, selection and service,” said general manager Siddharth Shanker.  To do so, Deliveroo has invested in technology with the launch of a new business intelligence unit and set up delivery-only central kitchens here. The latter, which runs on leaner cost structures, helps it to “reduce prices more meaningfully and sustainably”.  Deliveroo has also added a “very big number” of 2,000 freelance delivery riders since April, while attracting more than 300 restaurants that were formerly listed on UberEats – boosting its total restaurant-partners to 4,000 and delivery fleet size to 6,000.  “We anticipated that with the re-establishing of a player in the market, there will be uncertainty and it will be an opportunity for us to get market share … so we put together a plan months ago and once the merger happened, we started work on it,” said Mr Shanker.  While Grab declined to reveal the exact number of restaurants it is partnering, it said a majority were from UberEats.  “Our priority was to ensure that they come on board as quickly as possible in order to continue having a platform for delivery for their F&B business,” said a spokesperson, who added that these merchants enjoyed a waiver of an onboarding fee.  Noting that there are about 4,000 restaurants and 12,000 hawker stalls that remain untapped by food delivery apps, Grab said that it “will bring more food vendors online to offer the widest selection of cuisines and local delights for consumers, and more revenue opportunities for merchants.”  SMALLER PLAYERS SEE CONSOLIDATION? As the battle for food-delivery supremacy plays out, experts said smaller players may lose out and face consolidation.  “If the smaller rivals can’t match the deals offered to customers and partners, they might lose out. If Grab’s partner restaurants base is very large, the smaller players might lose out as well,” said associate professor Nitin Pangarkar from the NUS Business School.  However, some experts like TP’s Mr Tan said having a niche target market may help smaller players to stay afloat. Tie-ups with selected F&B outlets or diversification in the range of delivery services may also help, he suggested.  While there may be some short-term impact, Fastbee’s founder Khoo Kar Kiat said he remains confident that his business \"fills an unique niche\" and customers will return once the promotion campaigns wane.  Fastbee is an online portal for people to make lunch orders and later pick up their food from designated vending machines. Founded last year, the start-up focuses on delivering hawker food and targets workers at various industrial and business parks in the West.  “To keep our business sustainable, Fastbee has been continually refining our business processes in order to reduce our business cost even further,” he said.  For restaurants, the myriad of food delivery apps has been a boost to sales and brand visibility, with most preferring to team up with several platforms.  Bismillah Biryani Restaurant, for instance, is available on at least five, including GrabFood.  With the additional exposure likely to bring in more sales orders, Ms Zara Salahuddin, who manages the restaurant’s delivery business, said “there’s nothing to lose” even as terms and conditions offered by GrabFood remained the same as UberEats.  Despite that, the restauranteur said she will be watching the competition in the online food delivery scene closely.  Noting the possibility of a price war that could translate into perks for customers and restauranteurs, she said: “Who wouldn’t want lower commission rates or promo codes? But I think it’s also important that they don’t lower so much that it affects other parts of their business. That would be the worst-case scenario for all of us.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/promo-codes-lower-minimum-orders-is-a-price-war-brewing-among-10295802"}, {"datetime": "02 Jun 2018 06:44AM", "tags": ["runs", "races", "marathons", "waste"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "'See the number of cups thrown': Can the waste produced during marathons be reduced?", "content": " SINGAPORE: When avid runner Anjali Sharma started taking part in major running events in Singapore six years ago, she was shocked by the sheer amount of waste they produce. “You see the number of cups that are thrown and you just think, oh my god,” the 38-year-old, who runs a communications consulting firm, told Channel NewsAsia. “You open the race pack and you want to vomit, because there’s that much paper inside.” Ms Anjali, who grew up in India and ran competitively before moving to Singapore, participates in an average of five runs a year. This includes the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) and Great Eastern Women’s Run. And at each of her races, she tries to go waste-free by always carrying her own water bottle and giving up her race pack, medal and finisher’s tee. “I repeat my tees,” she said. “What are you going to do with the medal? You finish the 21km in two hours, you get a medal; you finish it in four hours, you get a medal.” “The amount of paper in the race packs – I get a vision of a factory line preparing these bags, and they’re literally picking up paper after paper and just dumping it inside the bag,” she added. While there are no statistics on how much waste is produced by the annual marathons here, Singapore Environment Council (SEC) executive director Jen Teo told Channel NewsAsia it is a matter for concern. “There’s a lot of litter found after these events, be it this type of race or National Day. It’s not just the litter, people dump their plastic bottles and it means a lot of waste out there to be cleared,” she explained. According to organisers, last year's OSIM Sundown Marathon – which attracted some 27,000 runners – produced almost 22,000kg of waste, just slightly less than the weight of two buses. The waste came from 39,700 banana peels, 18,075 packs of energy gels, paper cups and water bottles. Ms Teo said there’s “definitely an increase” in the amount of waste produced by such runs over the years, given how organisers try to offer more freebies to “get people excited or interested”. “Seriously, how much of all these do you use? It’s another goodie bag, T-shirt or medal that you collect,” she said. “But people are much more aware now in terms of what they can do to generate less waste by taking less, consuming less.” And these people, like Ms Anjali, are jumping at the opportunity to sign up for races with an eco-friendly slant. ZERO WASTE RUNNERS At this year’s Income Eco Run, which took place on Apr 29 and attracted 9,000 participants, a total of 1,974 runners participated as zero waste runners, which means they gave up their medal and finisher’s tee. This figure, according to an SEC audit released in May, is a 30 per cent jump from last year. Some 2,000 runners also opted out of getting race packs. This means organisers saved about 1,400kg of material including metal from medals, polyester from finisher’s tees and fabric from race packs, the audit showed. This figure is an 80 per cent increase from last year. While the audit indicated that each runner generated 0.1kg of waste, 26 per cent more than last year, the overall recycling rate also went up from 63 per cent to 94 per cent. This came as organisers used recyclable cups with 50 per cent less plastic lining as compared to standard paper cups, which cannot be recycled. On top of that, banana peels were composted and plastic bottles and cans recycled. Runners were also encouraged to carpool, use public transport or take provided shuttles to the event, meaning the race produced 30 per cent less carbon emissions as compared to last year. Ms Teo said the measures proved to be “significant”. “They have been very conscious about ensuring that at every step of the way, where they acquire the applicants, they also educate them on what they can do in terms of adopting an eco race,” she said. Ms Anjali, who participated in the Income Eco Run, said organisers made it simple for runners to reduce waste. “A lot of people want to be good people and help the environment,” she said. “So if I can just tick a button to choose to be a zero waste runner, then it just becomes so much easier.” To that end, she added, organisers made use of the thousands of runners, or “captive audiences”, to make an environmental difference on a larger scale. “Races should all do what Eco Run is doing,” she stated. “You’ve got those people, do something with it.” WHAT ARE OTHER RACES DOING? IRONMAN Asia, which organises the SCSM taking place on Dec 8 and 9, said it deploys ambassadors on its race route to encourage runners to recycle and sort trash into the correct bins. It did not say how much waste last year's race produced. A clean-up team will also comb through the route post-event to ensure all waste, including recyclable materials and gel packets, are recycled and disposed properly, it said. “The team has also increased the number of waste and recycle bins throughout the marathon route,” it added, pointing out that trash disposal was made fun by having basketball-themed bins to aim at. HiVelocity, which organises the OSIM Sundown Marathon, said it encourages runners to bring their own bottles through pre-event announcements on social media, and places signs along the route to remind runners to dispose trash responsibly. It also stretches water point areas by adding more but smaller disposal points, while placing larger disposal areas near the finish line. For this year's race, which took place on May 19 and 20 and attracted 25,500 runners, more recycling bins and signs were set up, organisers added, while ambassadors spread the message on-site through signs and pledges. Channel NewsAsia has contacted the organisers of the 2XU Compression Run, SAFRA Singapore Bay Run and Army Half Marathon, and Great Eastern Women’s Run for comment. MORE CAN BE DONE Nevertheless, Ms Teo feels that more organisers can follow suit. “There’s a lot more out there that can be done,” she said. “You’re talking about at least a hundred of these events in a year. And these are just sports events.” However, she acknowledged that organisers face logistical challenges when planning ahead and providing an option to give up freebies. Ms Rima Chai, an experienced runner who has since 2006 been lobbying race organisers to go green, said some are hesitant as they fear it might affect their brand. “People like free things,” the 48-year-old said. “Have you noticed how runners put up pictures of their goodie bag on their blogs and compare them with other races?” As for the runners, Ms Chai said some care more about their personal best timings. “It is another egotistical badge to have an excuse for not being mindful,” she said. For Ms Anjali, reducing waste during runs has not affected her experience “in any way”. “I didn’t lose out on anything,” she said.  “What I do think is that you would always have a section of society who would not opt for it. But you have to go with the fact that there’s a certain section of society that opts for it, and that’s what I am going to work with.” The pair also encouraged fellow runners to start by bringing their own bottle. “Learn to care,” Ms Chai said, highlighting how volunteers picked up 3.5kg of trash – including gel packs and shoe soles – along a 5km stretch of East Coast Park after last year’s SCSM. Ms Anjali added: “Go with whatever is easy for you to do, but do something.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/waste-produced-marathons-runs-races-organisers-go-green-10257948"}, {"datetime": "02 Jun 2018 06:44AM", "tags": ["inequality", "education", "university", "poverty", "low-income households"], "author": "Linda Lim", "title": "Commentary: Can education fix inequality in Singapore? If not, what can?", "content": " SINGAPORE: Combating inequality has been declared a “national priority” in Singapore.  This makes sense, given the pernicious effects that persistently high inequality can have on economic growth, political stability, social cohesion, quality of life, and even national security. The 2016 Brexit and Trump votes occurred in the two major developed countries with the greatest income inequality — the UK and US respectively. Studies suggest that socio-cultural as well as economic divides resulting from inequality contributed to these electoral results, which have since led to populist and protectionist policy proposals that will slow growth in the long run. Inequality itself also directly lowers economic growth through under-realisation of scarce talent, and weaker consumption demand — both are of particular concern to Singapore given our small labour force and market size.  As an already mature, high-income and thus slow-growing economy, we can also no longer expect rapid growth to mask the economic effects and social challenges of rising inequality, as it did in previous decades. Instead we need to boldly confront the root causes of inequality, which lie in how our economic and social institutions actually work. Focusing on education policy as the main solution can actually worsen inequality. HOW DOES EDUCATION CONTRIBUTE TO INEQUALITY?  In developed economies like the UK, US and Singapore, income inequality increases with average incomes because growth increasingly derives from the application of capital and skills, rather than labour, to production, as comparative advantage and technology shift in a capital- and skills-biased direction. This raises the returns to capital (profits and rents) and skills (PMET salaries) more than it does the returns to labour (wages). Education, especially university education, contributes to the widening skills premium (excess of skilled over unskilled labour income), and parents and students naturally clamour for more of it. This is where education and inequality are mutually reinforcing. Higher-income families invest more in private tuition for academic subjects, extracurricular enrichment activities, and parental attention.  This enhances their children’s school performance and chances of getting into “good” (elite, brand-name) schools and universities, thus achieving credentials that employers value and reward with “good jobs” and high salaries.  Employers are known to use educational certification and school reputation as “screening devices” that differentiate between job candidates, and as proxies for behavioral characteristics and social networks they believe enhance employees’ contribution to the enterprise. Expansion of higher education has been accompanied by a widening “college premium” — or gap between graduate and non-graduate incomes — even as the supply of graduates increases. Recent studies in the US and UK suggest that this is due to losses to non-graduates, as well as gains to graduates, as employers start requiring degrees for work that did not need it 30 years ago. And as university degrees become more common, institutional reputation becomes more important, intensifying competition for places at the most selective institutions, and widening their graduates’ salary premium over graduates of less selective institutions.

CAN EDUCATION REFORMS REDUCE INEQUALITY?  Policy-makers in developed countries have focused on reforms in education to reduce inequality. In some countries, particularly the US, unequal resource allocation between “rich” and “poor” school districts is a major factor contributing to unequal educational, employment and income outcomes.  This is less of a problem in Singapore, given the Ministry of Education’s worthy efforts to equalise the allocation of resources — including the “best” teachers and administrators — between “neighbourhood” and “elite” schools.  But it is hard to improve already high-performing, well-resourced schools. More importantly, as we noted in the New Nation in 1976: ”The effect of any school variable which can be manipulated by decision-makers is small relative to other determinants of student performance … Family background is a very important variable affecting educational performance and earnings of individuals ... changes within the school system itself will not necessarily bring about more equal performance of students in school or greater income equality among them when they are employed.” Recent, separate research by NTU associate professor of sociology Teo You Yenn, and NUS associate professor of social work Irene Ng, confirms the dominant impact of family circumstances on student performance in Singapore today. The PISA test which we regularly top shows that 15-year-old students in Singapore on average perform better than those in OECD countries, but here the gap between the top and bottom scorers is wider and the dependence on parents' socio-economic status higher. Another popular policy is to increase lower-income students’ access to more selective schools, including through priority admissions, as Singapore plans to do in Primary One and post-PSLE student assignments to elite schools. But at best this can cater to only a small subset of low-income students, probably those already best qualified. This could widen the student performance gap between elite and neighbourhood schools, and subject more families to “exam stress”.  Since school performance is heavily dependent on family resources, lower-income children could underperform relative to higher-income classmates in elite schools, reinforcing stigmatisation from priority admission, and lowering self-esteem which research shows is a major determinant of individual performance. Priority admission for lower-income children would also intensify competition among higher-income students for “fewer” elite school places, thus worsening the “education arms race”.  In the US, such competition has worsened inequality and increased social stratification by increasing home values (hence family wealth) in residential neighbourhoods in the top public school districts.   Tweaking Singapore’s education system will not reduce inequality because it does not change the underlying unequal socio-economic structure to whose incentives families of all income levels rationally respond. Parents naturally seek for their children entry into secure, well-paid employment in large corporate and government bureaucracies, and cartelised high-earning professions, which still use traditional academic credentials to screen candidates and remunerate employees.   READ: Is there an education arms race? A commentary. READ: Are we missing the point of education? A commentary. OUR ECONOMIC MODEL GENERATES HIGH INEQUALITY  Despite Singapore’s rapid growth in economic output and average incomes, income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient has increased since the late 1970s, and is high relative to other developed countries, before taxes and transfers. The Gini also counts only income from work, which in Singapore is under half of national income, a very low ratio by international standards. It does not consider wealth or property, which everywhere is more unequally distributed than income, especially in expensive dense cities. High inequality reflects several features of our economic development over the decades.  Most significantly, increased output has come mainly from factor accumulation, the employment of more capital and labour, rather than from productivity growth, which has been relatively low, and is necessary for labour incomes to rise.  The long and heavy reliance by business on cheap foreign labour, facilitated by government policy, has depressed wages of the low-skilled. The rapid increase in population necessary to propel this input-intensive growth model has also raised returns to owners of the scarcest factor in Singapore, land, thereby increasing the inequality that derives from residential home values and monopoly rents. Compared to other high-income countries, Singapore also has a relatively weak social safety net, lacking public provision for unemployment insurance and guaranteed social security (retirement income) that is almost universally provided elsewhere. THE IMPACT OF MERITOCRACY  The Singaporean ideology that we are a “meritocracy” where economic success based on hard work and the right academic credentials justifies unequal returns, poses two problems.  First, it entrenches hierarchy, and hence a systemic inequality to which social mobility can at best contribute slightly more diverse members at each level of the pyramid. Overall inequality does not decline, and at worst, those who fail to “make it” up the ladder are considered to “deserve” their inferior position on the social as well as income scale. Beginning with the competitive “streaming” of students by exam results at an early age, such stratification has stigmatising and demotivating effects which limit educational attainment and reduce intergenerational mobility.   Second, in the post-industrial society to which Singapore is inevitably transitioning, a laddered meritocracy and the social divide it subtends impede further economic progress. Innovation, and response to the disruption it causes, increasingly hinge on entrepreneurship rather than bureaucracy, risk-taking rather than risk-avoidance, diversity rather than similarity, collaboration rather than competition, imagination rather than instruction, contestation rather than conformity, and bottom-up rather than top-down initiative. In short, meritocracy as currently construed in Singapore, and served by the educational system, is arguably the problem, not the solution, for both economic development and inequality, as it is in other highly unequal rich societies.   A UK study shows that students from higher-income families are more likely to go to university, and to more selective universities. They also earn more than students from lower-income families who graduate from the same institutions in the same subjects, and with similar other characteristics.  In the US, Yale Law School professor Daniel Markovits has said American meritocracy has become ... a mechanism for the dynastic transmission of wealth and privilege across generations. Meritocracy now constitutes a modern-day aristocracy. REDUCING INEQUALITY THROUGH REDISTRIBUTION NEED NOT HARM GROWTH  We need to look outside the education system for policies that do work to reduce income and wealth disparities. They include higher tax rates on high income earners, levies on capital gains, estates and inheritance, and a stronger social safety net — all of which Singapore has eschewed, believing these would reduce the incentive to work hard, save and invest, and thus harm economic growth.  But high-income Scandinavian countries, Switzerland and Germany, have reduced inequality over decades through progressive universal tax-and-transfer systems that included labour market policies, spending on healthcare and social protection while growing at respectable rates and ranking high on productivity and innovation indices — some even while maintaining budget surpluses and strong currencies.   Some high earners may resent high tax rates, but all citizens benefit from subsidised public services, including health and education, and receive unemployment insurance and retirement pensions.  Besides reducing economic and social divides, these policies may also encourage savings for growth-enhancing investments in business enterprises (rather than housing consumption, as in Singapore). Recent improvement in Singapore’s still-high Gini coefficient also results not from educational policy, but from increased social transfers to vulnerable groups — subsidies for low-wage workers, the elderly and elderly poor. But these have been insufficient to narrow the cumulative wide income and wealth gaps created by past policies and market forces. Our post-tax-and-transfers Gini still ranks with the highest among developed countries (lower than the US but similar to the UK), is much higher than those of other small high-income economies (in Scandinavia), and is unlikely to be fiscally sustainable. However, we have run large budget and current account surpluses for decades, piling up huge foreign exchange reserves that have been well-invested by our sovereign wealth funds. More of these could be converted into social spending that could both increase productivity and reduce inequality. Reforming the education system — by equalising resources, eliminating streaming, increasing curricular flexibility and minimising social segregation — can reduce inequality and social stratification, and foster the innovation and entrepreneurship required for post-industrial economic growth, only if the deep-seated institutional roots of inequality are addressed.  The political will to do this is what matters in the struggle for a more just and equal society that will benefit all of us.

Gross, but that’s food of the future", "content": " SINGAPORE: Betting that eating insects will become mainstream one day, a home-grown venture capital (VC) firm is going big on bugs – by investing in grasshoppers as a food source. Managing director of Sirius Venture Capital Eugene Wong explained: “A piece of steak only gives you about 40 per cent in protein source. Grasshoppers, on the other hand, gives you about 70 per cent protein with no fats and is healthy.” With global demand on the rise but resources thinning out, there’s been a revolutionary hunt for more sustainable food sources, as the programme Money Mind discovers (watch episode here). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Together with a Dutch investment fund, Sirius led a US$600,000 (S$803,000) round of seed funding in Hargol FoodTech, an Israeli start-up that farms grasshoppers on a commercially viable scale. CREEPY CRAWLIES ARE THE FUTURE With one able to potentially farm grasshoppers in large quantities, investing in this insect – not a typical investment vehicle for VCs - does make financial sense. “Grasshopper has about 15 per cent more protein than cricket. So for the same amount of so-called food feed, you get better yield in terms of protein,” said Mr Wong. The company is not missing out on the cricket trend either – it also has a strategic placement in Chapul, a US-based maker of cricket protein bars. “There is a revolution going on to change the way we produce food, to change the traditional ingredients of food and make sure that the food supply is sustainable into the future,” he added. WATCH: What the future tastes like (2:53)  The United Nations has warned that the Western taste for diets rich in meat and dairy products is unsustainable as the global population moves towards a predicted 9.1 billion people by 2050. “General disposable income is growing. As people grow richer, they want to have protein, they want to have more food. And because of that, we are in need to feed the world,” said Mr Wong. Eating insects may be a solution – in fact, about two billion people worldwide, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, eat insects, estimated the United Nations Food and Agriculture Office. Professor William Chen, director of the Food Science & Technology Programme at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), pointed out that the nutrition profile of an insect is very similar to other animal sources in terms of protein content, lipid content, micronutrient and vitamins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But not much is known about the long term impact of insect protein on consumers. “Much more studies need to be done to establish whether there is any toxic effect on human health,” said Prof Chen. GROW MEAT INSTEAD An alternative protein source may lie in plants where 100 per cent plant-based meat products such as burgers are concocted in laboratories. Some of these “beef” burgers are made of natural ingredients such as wheat protein, coconut oil, heme – and tastes like the real McCoy. Beyond Meat, for example, successfully launched its Beyond Burger in 2016. Impossible Foods also introduced its plant-based meat burgers to restaurants in 2016. (Read: In Singapore soon? The 'impossible' burger that's meatier than real meat) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n However, not all plants are able to provide all the amino acids that one needs, said Mr Wong. “For protein to be recognised as a good protein, you need nine amino acids. Only soya or chia seeds and certain plants give you that full range of ingredients,” he pointed out.  Another way is to grow meat in the laboratory where cells are painlessly extracted from an animal and grown to “edible” size in cell cultures. So, instead of slaughtering livestock for the meat, we may end up with “meat-making” factories. Memphis Meats has already successfully produced beef, chicken and duck from animal cells, while Israeli clean-meat start-up SuperMeat hopes to replicate that success by growing real chicken meat in the lab. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The latter is confident it will have a product on the shelves in three years - it recently raised US$3 million in seed funding from investors which include Germany’s PHW, one of Europe’s largest poultry producers, and Sirius Venture Capital. But, there are challenges such as costs and the issue of consumer acceptance. A few years ago, the cost of a stem cell-based burger was US$30,000 a piece, recounted Prof Chen. Although it’s promising, how (can one) scale it up while reducing the cost such that it will be something that consumer can afford? Mr Wong acknowledged that for some, growing meat in a laboratory is pretty revolutionary. “When you get a cut and your muscle gets injured, actually your muscle grows. So conceptually, growing meat in a lab may not be that scary,” he countered. \"We all remembered the time when we had bird flu. And this kind of alternative technology actually helps us in times of crisis.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n BUILDING RESISTANCE Research is also being done to produce food that is higher yielding, has better quality and is resistant to diseases and climate change. Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) has come up with enhanced selective breeding techniques where genetic markers are used to identify young fish with desired traits that they want for cross-breeding. This is done by taking samples from the fish skin, examining the molecular markers, and determining if these fish have the traits that they want for cross-breeding, said Dr Azlinda Anwar, assistant director (Grants & IP Admin) at TLL. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The process is entirely natural and different from genetic modification where one alters the genes of the organism or adds to it. “So this is absolutely not a genetically modified organism because we do not alter the genome of the fish. We simply enhance selection of a natural process,” she explained. Using this method, TLL has been able to grow a more hardy variety of rice, Temasek Rice, that is already commercially available. It has also applied the same process to develop its own variant of the Asian sea bass which is commercially available at seafood retail boutiques and selected restaurants. The laboratory has identified markers that they want for this sea bass - fast growth, good quality meat and resistance to diseases. “We combine this molecular breeding with selective breeding. And from one hundred mass-crossing events, we come up with lead lines of fish that grows faster – with 30 to 50 per cent faster harvesting time compared to normal fish - and are resilient to diseases,” she added. “So they therefore they survive better and have more meat.” Watch the episode here.

During his speech, which was partly delivered in Chinese, Mr Heng said that there was big potential for both countries to develop AI.  “For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has a financial technology (Fintech) sandbox for companies to develop new financial solutions before launching them in the market,” said Mr Heng, who is also in China for a series of meetings.  Sandboxes are platforms that allow software to be securely tested in an environment where legal and regulatory requirements are relaxed. The Land Transport Authority is also testing driverless vehicle systems in such sandboxes in Singapore, Mr Heng said.  “We welcome businesses and entrepreneurs from China to testbed your solutions in our regulatory sandboxes,\" he said.  Mr Heng explained that AI can be used in many sectors to improve lives.  In law enforcement, AI and facial recognition technology can help police apprehend suspects. In healthcare, radiographers can use AI to read radiographs in a far more accurate and speedier manner.  Instant voice recognition and live translation technology were used during Mr Heng's speech to demonstrate the benefits of AI.  Mr Heng also said that Singapore has been investing heavily in the technology - and the National Research Foundation will invest up to S$150 million in AI over five years.  “Today, based on field-weighted citation impact, Singapore is ranked first in the world for research quality in AI,” Mr Heng said, referring to a metric that measures citations received by publications.  Using AI to raise productivity in Singapore and China, where there is an ageing population and slowing labour force, is especially important, Mr Heng said.  China has the most number of smart cities in the world, with about 500 cities that have rolled out pilot projects, he added.  In his speech, Mr Heng highlighted tie-ups in AI between Singapore and China thus far, including the Joint Research Programme that was established in 1999, as well as a joint grant call programme between the national science institutions of both countries in 2015.

The football team failed to make the list of athletes that got the nod from the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) selection committee to compete in the upcoming Asian Games.  SNOC confirmed to Channel NewsAsia in an email on Thursday (May 31) that the team were not selected as \"they did not meet the selection criteria\". \"National Sports Associations who are keen to submit new results for the committee's consideration may do so before Jun 15, 2018,\" said SNOC secretary-general Chris Chan. To be included in the Singapore contingent, the team have to match the top-six result at a previous Asian Games, or beat opponents ranked at least sixth in Asia. The FAS had been in this situation before. The football team were omitted in the previous edition of the Games in 2014, but were included after the under-23s beat Bahrain 3-2. This time, however, the clock is ticking for the FAS to mount a successful appeal as it is struggling to find opponents for a friendly match.  \"We had reached out to other associations for friendly matches as early as six or seven months ago,\" FAS' head of national teams management Eric Ong told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday. \"Most of them said that they were unable to play outside of the FIFA international window. That's the challenge we are facing and we have limited options.\" Associations are unable to call up players outside of the FIFA international window, explained Mr Ong, which means that most countries will be unable to form a team. He added that FAS has reached out to at least seven associations whose teams fit the criteria set by SNOC.  In the first FIFA international window this year, the Singapore U-23 team played against Indonesia and lost 3-0. The next window falls only in September because of the World Cup. \"We will see if we can arrange something in the next couple of weeks (before the Jun 15 deadline). But it may well be after that. If that happens, we will go back to the SNOC and inform them that we have something on the table,\" said Mr Ong. LOOK AT DEVELOPMENT, NOT JUST RESULTS Should the FAS fail to find a suitable team for a friendly match, Mr Ong is hoping that SNOC will look past the selection criteria and see the improvements that the football team have been making in the last few months.  \"We are looking at how the team have developed since the start of the year. It is a marked improvement compared to the Young Lions in the last few years,\" said Mr Ong, pointing out that the Young Lions are now in the top four of the Singapore Premier League (SPL).  The Young Lions finished bottom of the table in the previous two seasons of what was then known as the S.League. This year, the revamped league requires the local clubs to have at least six under-23 footballers in their squad, with a minimum of three to feature in the starting 11 in every game. \"They have showed the fighting spirit and determination,\" added Mr Ong. \"We went to the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy, made it to the semi-finals and came in joint-third.  \"In terms of friendly matches, we are playing without overaged players. We are able to bring three of them for the Asian Games and those players in key positions will make a big difference.\" In 2014, the Young Lions were eliminated at the group stage after losing narrowly to Tajikistan, holding Oman to a draw and beating Palestine.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/fas-struggling-to-find-opponents-to-justify-asian-games-10299616"}, {"datetime": "01 Jun 2018 06:20AM", "tags": ["North Korea", "Shangri-La Dialogue", "Six Party Talks", "Kim Jong Un", "South Korea", "United States"], "author": "Steven Borowiec", "title": "Commentary: Many helping hands to the North Korea headache begin work this weekend – in Singapore", "content": " SEOUL: The planned Jun 12 summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is shaping up to be a bigger affair than just a meeting between two countries seeking an answer to the old, vexing question of how to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. This week, South Korea confirmed that President Moon Jae-in is considering a trip to Singapore to turn the summit into a three-way meeting. There are also rumours that Chinese President Xi Jinping could appear. While this may sound like too many cooks in a hot, stuffy kitchen, the fact is that the main item on the summit agenda is a big, complicated issue that requires a multifaceted approach and the involvement of many actors. For years, that was how the relevant countries approached the North Korea question – collectively instead of individually. Through a framework dubbed the Six Party Talks, the two Koreas, the US, China, Japan and Russia held six rounds of meetings from 2003-2007. Having petered out with no major results – with North Korea having a much more advanced nuclear arsenal now than before the meetings started – the talks are mostly remembered as a failure and a testament to Pyongyang's determination to become a nuclear power. A REVIVAL OF MULTILATERALISM IN SINGAPORE THIS WEEKEND This kind of multilateral approach to the North Korea issue may see a revival in Singapore, and in the time leading up to the summit.  Another factor making Singapore a hotbed for policymakers is this weekend's Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual forum that brings together defense officials from around the region. The title of the session on North Korea, decided months ago, hones in on the need to \"deescalate crisis\" in North Korea. The diplomatic movements of recent months have meant that, at the current moment, goals have become far more ambitious than ratcheting down crisis.  South Korea's defence minister will be in attendance and will be able to update contemporaries from elsewhere in Asia on how Seoul is evolving in its defence posture. The changed tenor of the Shangri-La summit is a sign of how, at the very least, having gotten out of crisis mode is a positive step. INVOLVE MOON JAE-IN AND XI JINPING But the more consequential questions will be addressed at the summit and there is still a ways to go. First, it makes sense for Moon to take part in the summit. Slightly more than a year into his presidency, Moon has shown himself to be uncommonly adept at walking the diplomatic tightrope that presents every South Korean leader with their most daunting foreign policy challenge: How to work towards peace with North Korea while also maintaining strong, productive ties with the United States, Seoul's main ally. As president, Moon has skillfully developed relationships with both Trump and Kim, meeting with both men more than once each.  At least from the outside, Moon seems to have convinced both the US and North Korea that he has good intentions and is earnestly seeking a peaceful solution to the befuddling issue of denuclearisation and formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War. If Moon is on the ground in Singapore, he could act as a bridge between Trump and Kim, and if talks hit a snag, could remind his counterparts of the importance of the gathering and the need to work toward a meaningful result. Moon displayed this propensity for putting out fires when, after Trump abruptly called off the summit, he held an unannounced second summit with Kim to demonstrate his commitment to dialogue.  It is likely that Moon's calm influence had something to do with North Korea's uncharacteristically accommodative response to Trump's cancellation. Also, due to China's important role in Korean Peninsula affairs, Xi's presence, or some form of off-stage involvement by Beijing, would be a boon to the proceedings. This year, Kim has traveled twice to China for meetings with Xi in what were his first international trips since taking power in early 2012, strong signs that the two countries are mending ties after years of frosty relations caused mostly by China's frustration with the North's continued provocations and dogged pursuit of nuclear armament. That Xi is on board with efforts to get North Korea to denuclearise means he can act in concert with Trump and Moon. That China is still the North's closest ally means Xi has leverage in dealing with Kim that neither Trump nor Moon can match. That then leaves Japan and Russia. JAPAN AND RUSSIA AWAITING Japan is a major US ally and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to coordinate closely with Trump before the summit, possibly on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada in early June. Seeing as Japan is located within range of much of North Korea's military arsenal, Tokyo has long been especially eager to see North Korea take a turn toward peace and away from weapons development. Even Russia is in on the diplomatic flurry. This week Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov travelled to North Korea for talks that follow a trip to Moscow by North Korea's top diplomat. How Russia fits into the bigger picture is a tricky question, as Vladimir Putin is, at a time when his country's foreign policy priorities are closer to home, unlikely to invest much effort in a far-away matter in which Russia would be a minor player. But Russia enjoys growing relations with South Korea, and at least would not want to be seen as hindering efforts toward peace. STARS ALIGNING Less than two weeks before the summit, the stars are aligning in a way not seen since the Six Party Talks were last held more than a decade ago. The six countries still have their differences, but may be able to cooperate on this particular matter. But, as with so much when it comes to North Korea, the ultimate success of their efforts will be determined by North Korea's willingness, or lack thereof, to denuclearize. Pyongyang still holds the trump card, and multilateral cooperation isn't necessarily enough to convince Kim of anything. We could be witnessing the early stages of a new era of cooperation, or just the latest in a long series of disappointments.

With the new online portal Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) completely rolled out to all schools, from primary to junior college level, Mr Ong said that students are able to access the resources that the Ministry of Education (MOE) has built up. “It’s a great leveller,” said Mr Ong. “Just as we all have our handphones and devices, which serve as a great leveller, all of us have the same access to the same Internet pages, knowledge and videos.” The use of technology aside, he said that efforts to tackle the widening social stratification in Singapore must continue - an issue he had touched on in Parliament earlier this month.  “It is unfinished business. We have done so much to bring about a more equal and socially mobile society,” he said. “Our situation is very different from many developed countries. We read (about) many developed countries’ problems, which is stagnation, underclass and the inability to move up. “In our case, a great majority has been moving up. But that in itself created some problems, and I think we need to zoom in on those problems.” NURTURING DIGITAL LEARNERS Mr Ong was speaking on the sidelines of the 6th International Conference on Teaching and Learning with Technology (iCTLT), which is being held at the Resorts World Convention Centre from May 31 to Jun 1. The conference’s theme this year focussed on the role educators play in nurturing digital learners. It was the first time iCTLT included speakers and panellists from sectors beyond education, such as IT and social and family development. More than 1,500 local and overseas educators came together to share ideas, with 100 exhibits showcased. Woodlands Ring Secondary School was one of 353 schools at the event. It showcased a Virtual Reality tool to teach art and literature. Since 2017, the school has been using the technology’s interactive and kinetic capabilities to give students a spatial experience of art forms and move beyond non-digital media such as painting, sculpture and ceramics. Students were able to create 3D art and apply the technique to create non-digital art forms. Art teacher Deborah Ong said her students enjoyed the classes and were always actively finding different ways to use the tool. \"Most of them take to it like fish to water because they are already digital natives, and they often spend hours on their set making their artworks,” said Ms Ong. The school is in the midst of training more teachers to use the tool and hopes to roll it out to other subjects such as mathematics and science.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/efforts-tackle-widening-class-divide-must-continue-ong-ye-kung-10300212"}, {"datetime": "31 May 2018 09:02PM", "tags": ["Sembcorp Industries"], "author": "", "title": "Sembcorp Industries to buy UK Power Reserve for US$288 million", "content": " LONDON: Integrated energy group Sembcorp Industries has agreed to buy UK Power Reserve, Britain's largest flexible power generator, for an equity value of 216 million pounds (US$288 million).

This was up from 40 reports received in 2016, they said in a joint advisory. The two agencies said they had received an increasing number of complaints from members of the public about losses from unregulated online trading platforms over the past year, and warned the public to exercise \"extreme caution\" when dealing with such platforms.  \"These unregulated trading platforms allow investors to trade a wide range of products, such as foreign exchange, shares, commodities and binary options,\" said the advisory. Most of these platforms tend to be located outside Singapore, making it harder to verify the credibility of the platform's operations and posing greater fraud risk to consumers, it said. It is also challenging for investors to pursue claims against operators based overseas. In addition, investors are often instructed by operators of such platforms to transfer money to overseas bank accounts which are held in the names of people different from the platform operators, said the advisory. \"This makes it very difficult for investors to recover their monies when things go wrong,\" it said. These platforms may also require investors to pay for their trades or fund their trading accounts using credit or debit cards, exposing them to a further risk of unauthorised transactions on their cards. \"There is no regulatory safeguard for investors who choose to transact on unregulated trading platforms,\" said Mr Lee Boon Ngiap, Assistant Managing Director (Capital Markets), MAS. \"There is greater risk of fraud when investors transact on platforms operated by unregulated entities whose backgrounds and operations cannot be easily verified.\" He urged consumers to always \"ask, check, confirm\" before committing to an investment, to avoid potential scams. “Consumers should always be cautious when they come across an investment opportunity that promises high returns with assurances of little or no risks,\" said Mr David Chew Siong Tai, CAD director. \"These are likely to be a scam; if it sounds too good to be true, it most probably is.” Anyone with information on fraudulent activities taking place on unlicensed online trading platforms can submit information at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness, or lodge a police report via the Electronic Police Centre at www.police.gov.sg/e-services or at any Neighbourhood Police Centre/Post.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/total-of-s-7-8m-lost-from-trading-on-unlicensed-platforms-in-10296258"}, {"datetime": "31 May 2018 05:59PM", "tags": ["drugs", "drug enforcement"], "author": "", "title": "More than S$65,000 worth of drugs seized, 7 suspects arrested ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Drugs worth more than S$65,000 were seized and seven suspected drug offenders were arrested on Wednesday (May 30), in two separate operations conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).

The recommendation, proposed for companies that enjoyed productivity gains in 2017, was agreed upon after intense “negotiations into the early morning”, said members of NWC. The council is made up of representatives from employers, trade unions and the Government.  Dr Robert Yap, president of Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), said that there were proposals for the payment to be much higher than the S$300 to S$600.  \"But the whole idea behind this kind of a one-time productivity [payment] is the sustainability of it. We want to ensure that it is something that is manageable and will allow us to sustain rather than something that is one-off and then we regret,\" Dr Yap said.  Mr Yong added: “But we all agree that the message we want to send is that when there are productivity improvements, we want to make sure that we share the productivity gains with the workers and to tell the workers … that we will work harder in the coming year to continue to strive for productivity improvements. “Only with productivity improvements can we have sustainable annual wage growth.” Firms can look to their own productivity measures to determine if they have achieved productivity gains, said Permanent Secretary for Manpower Aubeck Kam. This can be a sale per person or an efficiency-related measure.  While NWC's recommendations also encourage companies that have done well in productivity growth to share the gains with all workers regardless of wage level, through a one-off special payment, it does not specify a figure or range unlike the case for low-wage workers.  NWC member Laurence Chin, governor of the American Chamber of Commerce, said that firms will appreciate the flexibility to give such bonuses as they like. \"The key point from a lot of companies is the flexibility to make decisions. ... There's a wide variance in terms of industries and how to calculate productivity and different companies they decide what particular key indication or qualities are considered important,\" Mr Chin added.  NWC chairman Peter Seah said that this is the first time a lump sum quantum has been proposed for productivity gains and it signals the council’s emphasis on productivity, especially because last year's productivity growth was \"very commendable\".  The Government and various tripartite stakeholders have accepted the NWC's recommendations. Apart from the one-off payment, the council also recommended a wage increment of between S$50 and S$70 for workers earning up to S$1,300. Representing the Government, Mr Kam said that the higher quantum of this year’s wage increase range reflects the improvement in general business conditions, while maintaining the flexibility for employers to provide wage increases. \"The Government supports the NWC's move to build upon the success of earlier tripartite efforts to raise the wage threshold and cover more low-wage workers,\" Mr Kam said. With all 23 Industry Transformation Maps launched, NWC said that employers should continue or start to operationalise the blueprints to spur more productivity and transformation.  Dr Yap said that employers should tap on programmes and initiatives launched by tripartite partners to upskill workers and to develop an agile workforce to support their business transformation.  \"The productivity gain in 2017 is terrific and we must ride on the momentum to press on with our productivity efforts. ... Successful industry transformation will create better quality jobs, raise skills, pay better, sustainable wages as well as grow the economic pie,' Dr Yap said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/special-bonus-low-wage-workers-share-productivity-gains-10296116"}, {"datetime": "31 May 2018 05:30PM", "tags": ["employment", "wages", "economy"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "National Wages Council suggests S$50-S$70 pay hike, one-off bonus for low-wage workers", "content": " SINGAPORE: Amid the pick-up in economic conditions, the National Wages Council (NWC) on Thursday (May 31) recommended that low-wage workers earning a basic monthly salary of up to S$1,300 receive a pay increase of S$50 to S$70. This is higher than last year’s recommendation of S$45 to S$60 for low-wage workers earning up to S$1,200. This is the third time that NWC is proposing a pay hike range and an increase in the basic monthly wage threshold for low-wage workers. The increase in the wage threshold last year covered more low-wage workers and led to improvements in their wage outcome, NWC said. The proportion of full-time resident employees earning a basic monthly wage of up to S$1,200 has also fallen from an estimated 8.1 per cent in 2016 to 7.7 per cent in 2017. Building on the progress made, the NWC said that it is useful to continue to provide quantitative guidelines for low-wage workers and to further raise the basic wage threshold. But NWC also noted that the adoption rate of its quantitative guidelines for low-wage workers in outsourced work fell from 49 per cent in 2016 to 44 per cent in 2017. For employers who did not provide wage increases, the top reasons cited were that they were constrained by contractual agreements or were already paying the market rate, it said. NWC urged service providers to adopt the same wage recommendations for outsourced low-wage workers and to factor in wage increases into their bid prices, particularly for the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors. ONE-OFF BONUS For companies that have achieved productivity gains in 2017, NWC suggested that they provide an additional one-off special payment of S$300 to S$600 to low-wage workers earning up to S$1,300. This can be paid to the employees in a lump sum or over several payments. MOM’s annual report on wage practices released on Wednesday showed that the number of companies that adopted the NWC’s recommendations for low-wage workers rose significantly from 21 per cent in 2016 to 48 per cent in 2017, the highest since 2013. Overall, 62 per cent of establishments with low-wage workers gave their workers a wage increase in 2017, up from 40 per cent in 2016. Industries such as accommodation and food services, community, social and personal services, and wholesale and retail trade were most proactive in adopting the pay increment recommendation. Industries such as construction, transportation and storage and manufacturing gave less. Establishments that did not grant wage increases to low-wage workers cited reasons such as poor business and already paying the market rate. There were also some concerns over the impact on business and wage costs, as well as poor employee performance.

It is estimated that there are more than 150 million tonnes of plastic in the world's oceans, with 8 million tonnes ending up there every year. This plastic can get broken down into smaller pieces and eaten by marine animals that mistake them for food. The NUS research team looked at smaller pieces of plastic - nanoplastics - using barnacles and their larvae to understand how nanoplastics could impact marine organisms. As barnacle larvae are transparent until they mature, feeding them with fluorescent, non-toxic nanoplastics meant the researchers could easily spot these under the microscope. \"Their short life cycle and transparent bodies made it easy to track and visualise the movement of nanoplastics in their bodies within a short span of time,\" said Mr Samarth Bhargava, a Chemistry PhD student who contributed to the research paper. The team demonstrated for the first time that nanoplastics consumed during the larval stage are retained and accumulated inside the barnacle larvae until they reach adulthood.  This was the case even when the organisms were exposed to a high concentration of nanoplastics for just three hours.  \"It's worrying, because this suggests that the organisms have a problem excreting and removing the nanoplastics, which increases the risk of bioaccummulation in the organisms, and subsequently into the rest of the food chain,\" said Dr Serena Teo, a Senior Research Fellow from the NUS Tropical Marine Science Institute who co-supervised the research.  The nanoplastics were found to have spread all over the larvae's bodies. According to the researchers, this was because the nanoplastics - which are about 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller than the larvae - are small enough to enter the organisms' bloodstreams and infiltrate cell walls. These nanoplastics can absorb pollutants and chemicals from the water.  “Barnacles may be at the lower levels of the food chain, but what they consume will be transferred to the organisms that eat them,\" said one of the authors of paper's authors, marine biologist Dr Neo Mei Lin from the Tropical Marine Science Institute at NUS. \"In addition, plastics are capable of absorbing pollutants and chemicals from the water.\" \"These toxins may be transferred to the organisms if the particles of plastics are consumed, and can cause further damage to marine ecosystems and human health.\" Associate Professor Suresh Valiyaveettil, who also supervised the research, said that plastic waste is a big concern. \"The lifespan and fate of plastic waste materials in marine environment is a big concern at the moment, owing to the large amounts of plastic waste and its potential impact on marine ecosystem and food security around the world,\" he said. However plastics are so prevalent in modern life that we cannot really get rid of them, said Dr Teo. Instead, she said the study emphasises the importance of waste management - not letting the plastics get into the ocean in the first place.  \"It also opens the doors for a lot of ways in how we shall now design new advanced materials,\" she added, giving the example of green plastics that degrade into inert molecules.  The next step for these researchers is to understand how nanoplastics affect other marine organisms such as tubeworms and sea urchins and, ultimately, how they impact human beings. The team’s research findings were first published online in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering in March 2018.

The site at Sims Drive is for residential purposes and the site at Tampines Avenue 10 is slated for an HDB executive condominium.  The 99-year leasehold can yield a total of about 1,880 residential units, with about 500 housing units at Dairy Farm Road, 680 at Sims Drive and up to 700 at Tampines Avenue 10. The Dairy Farm Road land parcel, opposite Dairy Farm Nature Park, is more than 19,000 sq m in size and has a permissible gross floor area (GFA) of about 41,000 sq m. It is expected to attract \"a healthy level of competition\" from developers due to its proximity to the Hillview MRT station and easy access to the Pan Island Expressway and Bukit Timah Expressway, said real estate firm JLL. \"Homes on this land parcel will enjoy good rental demand from expatriates as it is sited just adjacent to the soon-to-be completed international school (the German European School Singapore),\" said JLL's head of research and consultancy Tay Huey Ying.

With the food delivery scene heating up, industry players such as foodpanda and Deliveroo — which capture the lion’s share of the market — are increasingly tapping on data analytics to better compete and cater to customer tastes. According to managing director of foodpanda Singapore, Mr Luc Andreani, data currently drive about 90 per cent of its decisions, such as its rider-order allocation system. The platform has shifted from manual to automated processes as it scaled up over time. “At the very the beginning, we recruited riders and allocated them to a given order. So an order would come and manually we'd decide, OK this order goes to this rider,” Mr Andreani said.  “We fully switched a few years ago to a fully automated system, which is based on an algorithm that … calculates tens of thousands of operations every second.\" The system helps to \"optimise the supply on one hand – meaning the riders on the street – and demand on the other hand – meaning the location of the customers\", showing the best path for the rider to follow, said Mr Andreani. This has helped shave delivery time by half to around 30 minutes, and tripled manpower efficiency, enabling its fleet of 3,000 riders to deliver three orders per hour on average. Since foodpanda launched its central kitchen and dine-in space in Woodlands in March, the platform has shared weekly data reports with restaurant partners, including recommendations for under-performing brands. The Berlin-based player also has plans to launch a new app feature in the second quarter of this year, offering users a customised list of restaurants based on past orders. Another major player to incorporate data insights is Deliveroo, which set up its second kitchen concept, dubbed Deliveroo Editions, in Lavender in April. APPS SERVE UP DATA TO RESTAURANTS \"We've taken a look at the data of customers within this neighbourhood and adjacent neighbourhoods, to determine what are the most popular cuisines, and also which cuisines we should add to the area,\" said Deliveroo CEO Will Shu.  \"So in that case, restaurants know ahead of time if what they produce is something customers will really like.\" The Deliveroo Editions 2 site also has a \"click and collect\" option to help improve delivery efficiency. In a worldwide first for the London-based platform, customers can place their orders online and pick up their meals without having to pay a delivery fee. Data collection and algorithms are also used to provide real-time feedback to restaurant partners, including key peak times, to help improve delivery efficiency. The platform is also partnering seven restaurant vendors at its Editions sites to create virtual brands and exclusive menus based on data analytics.  One of them is VIOS by Blu Kouzina, a virtual spin-off from Greek restaurant Blu Kouzina. Since its launch in 2017, the virtual brand has made use of daily order reports to help cut down food wastage by up to 15 per cent and tripled its revenue. It also cross-shares around 65 per cent of its ingredients between its two menus, which has made its operations more \"effective and efficient\", said its co-founder Dennis Tsakiris.  \"The two menus side-by-side complement one other – if there's a dip we could use in the Blu Kouzina menu, let's say a yoghurt dip sauce, that could also be used as a small portion also in the VIOS menu.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/foodpanda-deliveroo-food-delivery-apps-ride-on-power-of-data-10288562"}, {"datetime": "30 May 2018 10:14PM", "tags": ["police", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "23 arrested for gambling, online sex advertising, other offences in joint operation", "content": " SINGAPORE: Eight women and 15 men, aged between 27 and 41, were arrested for various offences during a week-long joint enforcement operation, said the Singapore Police Force in a news release on Wednesday (May 30).  The operation, which was supported by Centreal Narcotics Bureau, was conducted between May 21 and May 27.  The police said that about 700 people at more than 70 residential and commercial units at Yishun, Ang Mo Kio and Sengkang were checked during the operation.  The eight women, arrested under the Women's Charter, were believed to be advertising sexual services online and operated within residential areas.  A total of S$730 in cash and 10 handphones were also seized, said the police.  Meanwhile, 14 of the men, aged between 23 and 51, were arrested for offences under the Common Gaming House Act.  Preliminary investigations revealed that four of the men were operating a gambling den while the 10 others were participating in the games.  A 44-year-old man was also arrested at a roadblock for drink-driving, said the police.  Investigation are ongoing, added the police. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/23-arrested-for-gambling-online-sex-advertising-other-offences-10290020"}, {"datetime": "30 May 2018 08:32PM", "tags": ["SNOC", "Asian Games", "Team Singapore"], "author": "", "title": "Team Singapore set to send largest contingent to Asian Games", "content": " SINGAPORE: Team Singapore is set to send its largest contingent to the upcoming Asian Games this year, with 246 athletes from 22 sports making the first cut on Wednesday (May 30), the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) announced.  The number could grow, with athletes who have yet to meet the qualifying mark given until Jun 15 to meet the selection criteria, said SNOC.

The three former Cabinet ministers stepped down as the minister for Communications and Information, Manpower and Trade and Industry, respectively, this May as part of a leadership renewal that has resulted in younger ministers heading two-thirds of ministries. Mr Lee added that political renewal has always been a key priority for the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and, given most of the third generation ministers – him included – are already in their sixties, they must renew the team “while we are still vigorous and on top of our game”. “We cannot wait until our generation runs out of steam before handing over the reins to the next generation,” he reiterated. “CHANGES PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT” On a personal note, Mr Lee said making these changes is difficult for him as it is “not like moving pieces on a chessboard” but it involves colleagues, comrades and close friends.

In fact, he joined the Cabinet at a crucial time after the Sep 11 terrorist attacks and, as Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, provided “crucial leadership” for the Malay-Muslim community during a moment of anxiety and uncertainty. He also pointed to the fact that during Dr Yaacob’s farewell lunch at MCI, the first group of people he thanked was the cleaning staff. “This speaks to the kind of leader and the kind of person Yaacob is,” Mr Lee said.  As for Mr Lim Swee Say, the prime minister said he had known him since their days in the Singapore Armed Forces. He had brought him into politics because of many suitable qualities: “Practical, persuasive and effective” as well as being “a little unconventional and irreverent”. Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once wrote that Mr Lim was a “natural” as Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress, Mr Lee recounted, and one of the many reasons why is because he is a “gifted communicator”. Pointing to the “vivid slogans” the former minister coined, including “Upturn the downturn”, “Cheaper, better, faster” and “Better, betterer, betterest”, Mr Lee said these “punchy, folksy and effective” slogans brought home key points to Singaporeans. In his tribute to Mr Lim Hng Kiang, the prime minister said he knew him the longest - since their days as contemporaries studying in Cambridge 45 years ago. During his time in politics, Mr Lim had played key roles in major crises like the SARS outbreak in 2003 as Health Minister and the global financial crisis of 2008, and he had been a “steady, absolutely reliable hand” overseeing Singapore’s economy in the last 14 years at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. “He knows when to let things be, and allow the free market to make our economy competitive and efficient,” said the prime minister. “At the same time, he also knows how to step in when the market is not working, to achieve political or social objectives with just the right policy measure.\" He added that while Mr Lim is a “laconic” man – “perhaps the only part of him that is unusual for a politician” - his point of view is always rational and incisive and his proposals are always pragmatic and with a human touch. “That is why I always listen to his views very carefully.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-political-leaders-in-sync-current-generation-10289770"}, {"datetime": "30 May 2018 07:31PM", "tags": ["Apple", "Singtel", "music streaming", "Spotify"], "author": "", "title": "Singtel to offer Apple Music without mobile data constraints", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singtel is partnering Apple to offer the latter’s Apple Music streaming service at a monthly fee that would not eat into customer’s existing mobile data limit - an offering the telco is touting as the first such tie-up in Singapore.

Building the substation underground will free up three hectares - or more than three football fields of space - of land. SP Group will construct the 230kV underground substation, which will have a commercial development sitting on top of it, on the site of the former Pasir Panjang Power District, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (May 30), at the launch of an exhibition showcasing Singapore’s underground projects. “We are in the process of drawing up plans to rejuvenate the area so that additional space that’s freed up by pushing the substation underground means there are more opportunities for redevelopment,” said Mr Wong.  “This is just for one substation. And we have many more substations, storage facilities and transport infrastructure all over Singapore.  \"So if you combine all of that, and progressively locate many of these facilities underground, there is tremendous potential for us to start thinking about the possibilities for future developments.” The new development will sit on the same compound as the Pasir Panjang Power Station, which was decommissioned in 1987. NO PLANS TO HOUSE RESIDENTIAL SPACES UNDERGROUND A 3D Underground Master Plan is also being developed by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and will be unveiled for selected pilot areas by 2019. The master plan will allow the authorities to plan for both “aboveground and underground possibilities, to ensure that they are compatible and seamless”. “The map will show what is already there in the ground, what we plan to build in the future, and the regulations and requirements for industry,” said Mr Wong. “All this can be updated whenever things change on the ground.” He also emphasised that the Government has no plans to build homes underground. “Some people have asked if we're planning for homes to be located underground in the future. Let me be very clear that we have no intention of putting residential homes underground,” said Mr Wong. Instead, the master plan’s priority will be to locate supporting infrastructure underground, such as utilities, storage facilities and transport infrastructure. The Government is also “actively looking” to have common services tunnels in growth areas such as the Jurong Lake District, Mr Wong said. CENTRALISED PLATFORM FOR UNDERGROUND PLANNING To provide more accurate data to facilitate underground development, a centralised platform collating different types of information for underground planning will also be made available.

Mohd Firdaus Abdullah, one of five men arrested in connection with the death of Satheesh Kumar Manogaran at St James Power Station, provided shelter for two fellow gang members, Muhammad Khalid Kamarudin, 22, and Muhammad Faizal Md Jamal, 23,  at his brother’s flat in Aljunied, the court heard. The alleged murder happened on Mar 12 last year. Firdaus was then a full-time police national serviceman attached to the Special Operations Command, according to court documents. The court earlier heard that the incident started with an argument between another gang member, Shawalludin Sa'adon, who was a waiter at Postbar at St James Power Station, and the man who died. Shawalludin, a co-accused, claimed that Satheesh tried to punch him. While the argument did not escalate at the time, Shawalludin asked a fellow gang member to rally \"back-up\" for a fight. Mr Satheesh was then fatally stabbed and another man was injured. After the attack, Khalid called Firdaus seeking shelter and Firdaus gave his brother's address.  Firdaus offered shelter to Khalid and Faizal with the intention to shield them from legal punishment, \"despite the knowledge that Khalid had committed murder\", according to court documents. After they arrived at about 6.15am, Firdaus provided clean clothes and a bandage for a wound. He also offered beer to his fellow members from the Sio Kun Tong gang, and the three of them sat at the corridor outside the flat and chatted. Firdaus then bought breakfast for them. Later that day, the trio went to a flat in Yishun, where co-accused Muhammad Hisham Hassan was living. They were arrested there at about 8pm on Mar 13, 2017. Hisham was in January sentenced to 18 months' jail for harbouring Khalid in the flat for 31 hours. Other than harbouring a suspected murderer, Firdaus was also convicted of being absent without leave from his full-time police national service duties and for trafficking, consuming and possessing drugs. He did not turn up at the Special Operations Command on Mar 29 last year, and was arrested about five months later on suspicion of drug-related offences. Other offences taken into consideration include criminal intimidation and harassment of a woman and the theft of a mobile phone belonging to the same woman at Nanyang Polytechnic, and being armed with dangerous weapons.  For the harbouring charge, he could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined.

And as pet owners become increasingly willing to spend on their dogs, they are also happier to mark birthdays or adoption days with occasion cakes that both dog and owner can enjoy.  For these dogs’ doting owners, it’s worth spending upwards of S$70 on a pretty treat that’s made with premium, organic, human-grade ingredients, since only the best will do for Fido. That’s especially true if the dog has special dietary restrictions, allergies or age-related conditions. And it’s not just for birthdays – many are also ordering cakes and tarts as special treats to share with their ailing dogs before it’s sadly time to say goodbye. Whatever the occasion, the doggie cake trend is gaining momentum, as we found when we visited three doggie bakeries specialising in all-natural treats. At Barking Good, founder Sim Dionne said that demand for their cakes has tripled in the last year or so. As for Gwen Tan of Superdog Kitchen, a home business specialising in doggie tarts, she now sees about 15 per cent more orders, compared to a year ago. Even the cost of the ingredients has risen with demand, said The Barkery’s Ann Marie Chua, adding that they do try their best to keep products affordable for their customers. Still, it seems dog owners are happy to spend top dollar on their fur kids. These treats aren’t your basic pupcakes – they’re carefully engineered works of art. And because they are made only with natural ingredients, hoomans can partake in the feast. To be able to share the same cake with your canine bestie on a special occasion and know that it’s a healthy yet delicious treat – well, to a pawrent, that’s worth all the licks on the face in the world. THE BARKERY Years ago, when Ann Marie Chua, 29, got her golden retriever Toby, the runt of the litter with digestive problems, she realised that there was a growing awareness and demand amongst dog owners for better food for their dogs. Since Toby responded well to her aunt’s home recipes, they decided to open the gourmet dog bakery The Barkery in 2011. “Dogs don’t have a choice in what they’re fed. And the majority of commercially produced pet food is full of fillers, artificial preservatives, additives, flavouring and colouring,\" said Chua.  \"So, it’s very important that our products are made from all-natural, premium, human-grade ingredients. We don’t use fondant, sugar or colouring. It’s very important for us to produce something that is good for them, and that, just as importantly, they enjoy eating,\" she said. One of The Barkery’s best-selling designs is their Burger Cake, which consists of a real beef patty sandwiched between meatloaf buns. The accoutrements are made from potato coloured with natural ingredients. For instance, the “cheese” is coloured yellow with turmeric, the “lettuce” is coloured green with spirulina and the “ketchup” is coloured red using beetroot. The single-patty burger cake costs S$68 for a 1kg cake. They also customise cakes according to customers’ requests – and there have been some unusual ones.  “There was a request for a cake to be made entirely of pure durian, and in the shape of a trophy because the dog had just won an agility competition, and durian was his favourite food. We managed to do it and that was an accomplishment,” Chua said.  “We also have requests from customers whose dogs have extreme allergies and can’t eat most proteins. We have made cakes out of crocodile meat, kangaroo meat and even frog meat.” sgbarkery.com BARKING GOOD Sim Dionne, 25, who was motivated by the desire to give her malti-poo Noodles more wholesome treats, opened Barking Good in 2014. “When we come up with new cakes or treats, we make sure that the dog’s experience is at the forefront of our minds. It has to taste and smell good,” she said.   One of Barking Good’s most popular designs, the Nigiri Sushi Cake, comprises a hand-shaped meat patty covered in what looks like grains of rice. These are actually made of potato and each grain is rolled by hand.  The slab of “salmon” on top is made from sweet potato and decorated with potato to create the marbling effect. Other ingredients include carrot, broccoli, beet, carob, spirulina, rosemary and even activated charcoal, which is used for the “seaweed”. A 1kg Nigiri Sushi Cake costs between S$150 and S$200, depending on the type of meat selected for the filling. “We use only all-natural ingredients in our cakes and goodies. The colours in the cakes are derived from plants or fruits,” Sim said.  This natural approach has created issues when customers want cakes with fancy colours, such as neon ones. \"We always explain our philosophy of using only natural ingredients, and we work out a design that looks good and is healthy for the pets.” It can get emotional in the kitchen when a cake is meant for a dog’s last birthday or last meal – when owners request for the cake to say \"Goodbye, we love you\", she said.  “At the same time, we are very honoured to be part of the journey of saying goodbye to a beloved pet.” barkinggood.sg SUPERDOG KITCHEN Superdog Kitchen, which specialises in doggie tarts, was born in 2012 when Gwen Tan, 33, started baking for her golden retriever, which had developed irritable bowel disease at the age of four. Back then, all the ingredients had to be imported. But in recent years, and with growing awareness, the former makeup artist has been able to find and work with local suppliers. Many of Tan's customers have dogs with allergies and sensitive stomachs. It isn’t easy, she said, to concoct something they can eat and “still make it look like a celebration”. Superdog Kitchen’s Aloha Summer tart certainly fits the bill. The eye-catching confection is topped with mango, papaya, kiwi, apple, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries. The organic fruits are personally selected by Tan from her wet market suppliers.  The nine-inch Aloha Summer tart costs S$85, while a tart of the same size with just one type of fruit, such as strawberry or mango, costs S$70. Mini tarts, sold in threes, are also available for small dogs. All are handmade from scratch by Tan herself. Each tart’s pastry is made with chickpea flour, which is free of wheat, gluten, soy and corn; olive oil instead of butter or shortening; and cage-free eggs. It’s then baked and filled with doggie ice cream, which is hand-churned from organic Greek yoghurt and flavoured with manuka honey, organic vanilla beans or pure durian. The durian flavour, Tan said, is the most popular – customers can choose between D24 and Mao Shan Wang. She also makes cheesecakes – including durian cheesecakes – quiches and meat tarts. None of the treats contain sugar, salt, preservatives or colouring. “Although there is no seasoning, it’s still very tasty because I always make sure the flavours pair well,” she said. It all comes from a desire to enjoy experiences together with her dogs. “For me, cooking has always been about love and family, and dogs are family,” she said.  That is why, even though Tan has been approached by investors, she prefers to keep the business small. “If my hands are full, I won’t accept more orders, and I won’t accept last-minute orders because that would compromise the quality. Nothing good comes out of rushing things.” Tan also makes tarts for dogs, who are nearing the end of their lives, as their final treats. Flavours are especially important to whet their appetite. \"That’s very special for me because dogs don’t have very long lives, and my customers are dog owners who care about their dogs,\" she said. facebook.com/superdogkitchen", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/birthday-cakes-for-dogs-natural-human-grade-organic-diet-10286254"}, {"datetime": "30 May 2018 03:31PM", "tags": ["Pedra Branca", "Malaysia"], "author": "", "title": "Malaysia drops challenge to ICJ ruling on Pedra Branca", "content": " SINGAPORE: Malaysia has discontinued proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) relating to the court's 2008 judgment, which awarded sovereignty of Pedra Branca to Singapore.  In a press statement on Wednesday (May 30), Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it had been informed by the ICJ of Malaysia's decision to drop two cases to revise and to interpret the judgment.

The 161-seat flights to Newark Liberty International Airport on the new Airbus A350-900ULR will cover about 15,329km, and travelling time will be up to 18 hours and 45 minutes.  These will eclipse the 14,525km Qatar Airways flights from Doha to Auckland as the world's longest, according to airline data provider OAG. The Singapore-Newark flight marks the return of a popular route for Singapore Airlines. The carrier had flown the marathon flights until 2013, when high fuel prices made the use of four-engine Airbus SE A340-500 jets uneconomic. It has since flown to New York's JFK Airport via Frankfurt. For a start, the Singapore-Newark flight will operate three times a week from Changi Airport on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Daily operations will start from Oct 18 when an additional aircraft comes into service. The aircraft will have two cabin classes - Business and Premium Economy. Tickets will be made available for sale progressively across various booking channels starting from Thursday, said SIA. “We are pleased to be leading the way with these new non-stop flights using the latest-technology, ultralong-range Airbus A350-900ULR,” said SIA CEO Goh Choon Phong. The new Airbus range features higher ceilings, larger windows and better air quality, said SIA. It is the world's first customer for the new A350-900ULR, an ultra-long range version of the fuel-efficient twin-engine A350 jet, and SIA expects the first aircraft to be delivered in September. Seven more such aircraft are due for delivery by the end of the year. Changi Airport Group (CAG) welcomed this announcement as well on Wednesday, noting that the new service is Southeast Asia’s only non-stop connection to the North American east coast. \"With the advent of ultra long range aircraft, non-stop long haul routes are now more efficient and viable,\" said CAG’s managing director, air hub development, Mr Lim Ching Kiat. \"I’m confident it will be well-received by Changi Airport’s passengers, especially time-pressed business travellers. \"With strong traffic growth between the North America and Southeast Asia regions, there are growth opportunities to be tapped,\" he added. With the new Singapore-Newark service, there will be 72 weekly passenger services between Changi Airport and the United States, said CAG. It added that there were 692,800 passenger movements recorded on direct flights between Singapore and the United States last year. There are also plans for non-stop Singapore-Los Angeles flights that will be announced later, said SIA. Aside from Singapore Airlines, other airlines including Qantas Airways and United Airlines are adding ultra-long haul flights that can capture an airfare premium of around 20 per cent versus flights involving one or more stops. Qantas has said it is considering the purchase of the A350-900ULR or Boeing Co's 777X to allow it to fly non-stop from Sydney to London from 2022, an even longer 17,038km journey.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sia-new-york-world-longest-commercial-flights-airbus-a350-oct-11-10288258"}, {"datetime": "30 May 2018 11:45AM", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "Singapore Airlines", "Sri Lanka", "Colombo", "conservation", "United Nations"], "author": "", "title": "Endangered whale shark fins found in Singapore Airlines shipment to Hong Kong", "content": " HONG KONG: Shark fins from endangered species including the giant, placid whale shark were found in a Singapore Airlines shipment to Hong Kong in May, highlighting the widespread challenges the Chinese territory faces in regulating the trade. In videos provided by Sea Shepherd Global, bags of shark fins tagged with Singapore Airlines Cargo labels were seen in front of a dried seafood store in Hong Kong. The 980kg shipment of assorted fins came from Colombo, Sri Lanka via Singapore. Singapore Airlines, which bans shark fin cargo, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday (May 30) that the shipment had been labelled as \"dry seafood\". Hong Kong permits imports of shark fins, viewed as a delicacy, but shark species listed by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) must be accompanied by a permit. Hong Kong is the world's largest trading hub for shark fins and has moved to stop illegal trading. On the fringes of the former British colony's industrial Western district where the Singapore Airlines shipment was sent to, warehouses brim with bags of shark fins while dried seafood stores are stacked high with the product. Gary Stokes, Asia director at Sea Shepherd, who discovered the endangered fins within the shipment, said: \"This is another case of misleading and deceiving. The shipment came declared as 'dried seafood' so didn't flag any alarms.\"  Singapo​​​​​​​re Airlines said it had sent out a reminder to all its stations to immediately conduct sampling checks on shipments labelled \"dried seafood\" and had blacklisted the shipper. The airline was not able to provide further details. A Sea Shepherd investigation last year revealed that Maersk, Cathay Pacific and Virgin Australia Cargo, which ban transport of shark fins, were targets of shark fin smuggling including those from endangered species. Viewed as a status symbol, shark fin is typically consumed in a shredded jelly like soup believed to have nourishing benefits. Restaurants across Hong Kong serve the delicacy, including one of the biggest chains, Maxims, which is half-owned by a unit of conglomerate Jardine Matheson Group. Over 70 million sharks are killed annually, pushing over a quarter of species into extinction according to WWF.

At 3.8 per cent, nominal wage increase was higher than the year (3.1 per cent) before but higher inflation meant real wage growth was moderated, said the Report on Wage Practices 2017 released by MOM's manpower research and statistics department. After accounting for the change in inflation, which was negative 0.5 per cent in 2016 and 0.6 per cent in 2017, real total wage growth was 3.2 per cent last year, slightly lower than the 3.6 per cent seen in 2016. Last year, 65 per cent of companies raised their workers' wages and more workers had salary increases, MOM added. This was higher than 2016's 58 per cent. Overall, there was an increase in the proportion of employees who worked in profitable establishments. The proportion of establishments that cut total wages also fell, from 17 per cent in 2016 to 12 per cent in 2017. As a result, the proportion of employees who received wage increases also rose slightly from 75 per cent in 2016 to 78 per cent in 2017.  The average wage increase for this group of employees was 5.1 per cent, higher than 2016's 4.9 per cent. The percentage of employees who received wage cuts dipped from 13 per cent in 2016 to 10 per cent in 2017. The average wage cut for this group of workers was 3.9 per cent, lower than the 5 per cent cut in 2016. More companies (62 per cent) with low-wage employees earning a monthly basic wage of up to S$1,200 gave raises to these employees in 2017, up from 40 per cent in 2016. The basic wage increase for low-wage employees was 8.9 per cent, MOM said.

The home-grown company, its executive director Or Toh Wat, project engineer Wong Kiew Hai, project director Yee Chee Keong, professional engineer from CPG Consultants Robert Arianto Tjandra, and accredited checker from another company Leong Sow Hon were accused of several offences under the Building Control Act and the Workplace, Safety and Health Act.  All of them were represented in court. Chinese national Chen Yinchuan, 31, was killed in the Jul 14 incident while 10 others were hurt.  A multi-agency probe into the collapse found that corbels - brackets that help support beams - had given way. Cracks were also found in the areas supporting 11 other parts of the viaduct. The charges faced by the company include failing to conduct an adequate risk assessment of the corbels when it became aware of cracks that appeared on them and failing to stop all works that were taking place on the viaduct section where fresh cracks had appeared. Or, 50, faced similar charges.  In addition, Or was charged with carrying out unauthorised strengthening works without the approval of the Commissioner of Building Control. Tjandra, 44, Wong, 30, and Yee, 48, were charged with \"recklessly doing an act which endangered the safety of others\".  Tjandra, a qualified person engaged to design the viaduct and supervise the carrying out of the building works for the construction, was charged with putting up structural plans without checking on the design assumptions made for the corbels that cracked and omitting to carry out the necessary remedial works to rectify the inadequate design. He faces five charges. Wong and Yee allegedly failed to stop all works on the viaduct section when they discovered cracks on the corbels of piers that were supporting a viaduct section. Yee faces three charges while Wong faces two.  Tjandra was offered a bail of S$15,000 while Wong and Yee were offered S$20,000 bail. Leong, 60, was charged with failing to evaluate, analyse and review the structural design in the plans and perform original calculations for the permanent corbels. OKP Contractors was awarded the project despite being assessed to have a “low performance score”, it was revealed in Parliament in August last year. Just days before the accident the contractor had been convicted over a separate fatality at another work site in 2015. As OKP has been previously convicted, it faces a maximum fine of S$1 million. Leong faces a fine of up to S$100,000, up to two years in jail or both, while the other four individuals face a maximum fine of S$200,000, up to two years in jail, or both.  In a media statement on Wednesday, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it will be studying its options carefully and reviewing the viaduct project with OKP. The project was scheduled for completion in 2020. LTA said it has appointed an independent professional engineer to assess the structural integrity of the viaduct under construction. \"Any other sections, which are assessed to be unsafe by the independent professional engineer will be demolished,\" LTA said. It added that all the crossheads will be demolished as a safety precaution following the earlier discovery of cracks on corbels at the incident site. \"After the accident, propping was extended to the parts of the viaduct where cracks were discovered at the corbel area. This was to ensure that there would be no safety risks,\" an LTA spokesperson said in a follow-up statement clarifying the scope of the demolition work. \"Since the accident, there has been a stop-work order on the viaduct.

Current employees who want to progress in their careers, as well as those who want to join the industry can use the framework to see where they can go, and then attend relevant training programmes to improve their skills and prepare themselves for the desired jobs.  The training programmes under the new framework include some focus on emerging skills in the industry, such as data analytics, cybersecurity, robotics and automation, the agencies said.  Employers can also tap on the framework to identify gaps in skills and send their workers for upgrading, they said, adding that grants and subsidies will be available.  The Industry Transformation Map aims to create an innovative industry enabled by technology and a highly competent workforce by 2030.  As part of the roadmap, LTA is looking to create 8,000 new public transport jobs by 2030 and is investing S$25 million in funding for mobility-related innovation and technology, it previously stated.  \"KEEPING PEOPLE IN THE LOOP\" Speaking at the launch of the skills framework, Dr Janil said that while the public transport sector is facing disruption from new technologies such as autonomous vehicles, “keeping people in the loop” will be very crucial.  “A human is there partly to ensure the operations work well, to ensure the safety and security of passengers. But frankly, at this point of time, also to troubleshoot when the automated systems don’t quite work as expected,\" said Dr Janil.  The most important ingredient for the skills framework to take off, according to Dr Janil, will be the mindset of workers to continue to upgrade and upskill themselves.   The skills framework will be reviewed at least every two years, he said, adding that it is focused on rail and bus operations and maintenance as these are where there are “pressing needs” given Singapore’s plans for expansion.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-skills-framework-smrt-sbstransit-rail-bus-jobs-to-support-10288042"}, {"datetime": "30 May 2018 08:28AM", "tags": ["cryptocurrency", "bitcoin", "initial coin offering", "MAS"], "author": "Emir Hrnjic", "title": "Commentary: Deciphering the cryptic world of Initial Coin Offerings", "content": " SINGAPORE: In the frenzied, rollercoaster world of cryptocurrencies, a new term has been grabbing investors’ attention: Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs. Last year, according to Forbes magazine, ICOs raised almost US$5 billion - a huge leap from just US$101 million in 2016. In 2018, some analysts expect upwards of US$18 billion to be ploughed into ICOs, with Singapore fast becoming a leading Asian ICO market. To the uninitiated, ICOs might sound like IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) – but they are vastly different. Despite the massive funds being channelled and the feverish interest surrounding them, most retail investors have little understanding of this innovative fundraising method. The ICO process typically begins with issuers publishing a white paper describing the product or service they promise to build. Investors then buy coins or tokens which promise access to this product or service. Unlike IPOs, ICOs take place at a very early point in the life cycle of the company. While the vast majority of IPOs are issued by well-established, profitable corporations (notable exceptions being during the Internet bubble of the late 1990s), ICO projects are in the development phase and have not made any profit. Moreover, ICO white papers generally do not reveal company financials and tend to be inconsistent and unreliable. IPO prospectuses on the other hand contain carefully audited financial statements and follow well-established regulatory procedure. As a consequence, the due diligence process with ICOs is simpler and shorter, without the armies of bankers, lawyers, and auditors typical of IPOs.  This, however, is a double-edged sword as ICOs also have less transparency, less regulation, and offer essentially nothing in the way of protection for investors. While shares in IPOs represent equity in the firm and votes to shareholders, ICOs generally represent tokens sold at a discount and are an asset rather than a security. ICO entrepreneurs maintain full control over the venture. Furthermore, while IPOs involve listing on an exchange - meaning companies need to satisfy various requirements including issuing audited quarterly financial statements and other disclosure - ICO listing requirements are almost non-existent. READ: The secret sauce behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a commentary. SUBSTITUTE FOR VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING? There are several other differences, but in short ICOs are much riskier than IPOs. That does not mean however that they should be dismissed outright. Misleading names notwithstanding, it could be argued that ICOs are a useful substitute for Venture Capital (VC) funding due to similarities in the stage of company’s life cycle and risk profiles. This brings with it a different set of implications. The key function of the VC industry is funding start-ups, the overwhelming majority of which fail. It is a high-risk business, yet those few that do succeed often do so spectacularly and more than compensate for the many failures – think of Facebook, Google or Amazon. Famously, SoftBank’s US$20 million VC investment in a start-up named Alibaba in 2000 grew to roughly US$58 billion at its IPO fourteen years later – a mind-boggling 300,000 per cent return. So why should these spectacular returns be reserved only for rich VC companies? Shouldn’t a regular guy get a shot? The answer is more complex than it seems. First, ICOs generally do not have a working product, making them even riskier than a regular start-up. VCs typically demand a “proof of concept” and a knowledgeable, experienced management team. Second, VCs often get a seat on the board in return for their investment, allowing them to advise as well as monitor the company. They also provide much-needed connections to ambitious and energetic - but often inexperienced - entrepreneurs. ICO companies however do not entitle investors to any input in governance, even though they provide cheaper and quicker funds compared to VC investors. Finally, unlike illiquid VC investment, ICO tokens are typically liquid, which provides an easy exit strategy for ICO investors. However, this liquidity can also lead to short-termism as investors may pressure firms to focus on short-term results at the cost of more significant long-term benefits. ATTRACTED BILLIONS IN FUNDING ICO disadvantages notwithstanding, fueled by rapid advances in technology and headlines about exceptional returns, hundreds of promising crypto-related products have attracted billions of dollars via ICO funding. As a case in point, Ethereum’s ICO raised around US$20 million in 2014 and has since evolved into the platform of choice for other ICOs. Meanwhile its market capitalisation has reached US$60 billion. More recently, a WhatsApp–like chat platform, Telegram, raised a record US$1.7 billion via ICO. However, as billions of dollars have poured in ICOs and scores of novice investors entered the ICO arena, so too have fraudsters, scammers and charlatans eager to exploit naïve investors. Perhaps the ultimate example of investors gullibility is PonziCoin, which was launched as “the world’s first transparent, decentralised Ponzi scheme built on the blockchain.” Yet even this obvious parody attracted inexperienced investors. According to a recent survey, regulators most commonly identified ICOs and cryptocurrencies as high risk. Furthermore, while millennials were deemed most likely to use fintech products they were also most at risk of fraud from fintech products. Since millennials have the highest cryptocurrency ownership rate among different age groups, they seem most likely at risk from cryptocurrencies as well. DRIVING INNOVATION A recent academic study from NUS Business School found that several common factors lead to more innovations in companies, the most important of which is access to capital. Since many ICO ventures would not be able to raise comparable amounts via traditional sources, ICO funded start-ups will likely lead to more innovations with potential benefits to economy and society. While ICOs differ dramatically from IPOs or VC investments, there is an emerging role they play in helping fund projects that would not have received financial support from traditional sources. In turn, there is a case for expecting that the access to capital they offer will likely lead to more innovations benefitting economy and society. Indeed, as more funds pour in crypto-related products and blockchain technology’s acceptance continues to spread, we can expect to see the proliferation of innovative blockchain applications. However, recent reports found that almost half of ICO projects have already failed, while cryptocurrencies recently plummeted, thus, renewing concerns about overvaluation. Additionally, regulators have ramped up warnings about suspicious ICO projects, while some ICOs have become targets of class action lawsuits. Indeed, the Monetary Authority of Singapore recently directed an ICO issuer to cease offering digital tokens and warned eight exchanges in Singapore to stop trading in digital tokens that resemble securities. These negative developments may potentially cool off exuberant investors and deflate the hype over ICO and, most likely, increase due diligence of ICO backed projects. As competition heats up and investors become more selective, we will witness a further evolution of the process, which will likely include standardisation of carefully vetted and better organised white papers including more comprehensive risk disclaimers. Retail investors however should still be aware that despite the headlines and the hype, investing in ICOs at present is opaque, high risk, and offers little to nothing in the way of protection.

A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. SENIOR VISIT If his trip is confirmed, Kim Yong Chol would be the most senior North Korean official to meet with top officials in the United States since Jo Myong Rok, a marshal, met with then-President Bill Clinton at the White House in 2000. A former military spy chief, Kim Yong Chol has been a central player in the recent thaw in relations between North Korea and South Korea, as well as the United States. Kim joined Kim Jong Un in both of his two meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April and May, and hosted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when his visited Pyongyang most recently early this month. The United States and South Korea blacklisted Kim Yong Chol for supporting the North's nuclear and missile programmes in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Due to sanctions against him, Kim Yong Chol is banned from visiting the United States normally. Any visit to the United States would indicate a waiver was granted. During his tenure as a senior intelligence official, Kim was accused by South Korea of masterminding deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010, and was linked by US intelligence to a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014. North Korea denied any involvement in the attack on the ship and on Sony Pictures. DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS In a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend, Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a surprise meeting on Saturday at the border village of Panmunjom, during which they agreed the North Korea-US summit must be held. And on Sunday, the US State Department said American and North Korean officials had met at Panmunjom. Sung Kim, the former US ambassador to South Korea and current ambassador to the Philippines, led that American delegation, an American official told Reuters. Moon said Monday there could be more impromptu talks between the two Koreas in the lead-up to the summit. In Kim and Moon's first, upbeat meeting on Apr 27, they agreed to seek the \"complete denuclearisation\" of the Korean peninsula - but didn't define what that meant, or how that would proceed. Since then, North Korea has rejected US demands for it to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons programme that experts say could threaten the United States. Analysts believe Washington is trying to determine whether North Korea is willing to agree on sufficient steps towards denuclearisation to allow a summit to take place. North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programmes as a deterrent against perceived aggression by the United States, which keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. It has long said it is open to eventually giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and ends its “nuclear umbrella” alliance with Seoul.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/top-aide-to-north-korean-leader-lands-in-singapore-as-summit-10285756"}, {"datetime": "29 May 2018 10:51AM", "tags": ["Ministry of Manpower", "foreign workers"], "author": "", "title": "Construction company fined for housing foreign workers in cramped, filthy conditions", "content": " SINGAPORE: A construction company was fined S$352,500 last Thursday (May 24) for housing its foreign workers in overcrowded, filthy and unsafe conditions, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday.  Keong Hong Construction had also been barred from employing foreign workers, according to a press release by the Manpower Ministry.  The company was the operator of a construction site temporary quarters at Sembawang Crescent, which had an approved occupancy of 182 foreign workers.  MOM officers, however, found 207 foreign workers living there during an inspection on Mar 8 last year.  Aside from its own workers, Keong Hong was also found guilty of abetting 17 other employers to house their foreign workers in the same quarters, the Manpower Ministry said.  The living space was cramped, with areas for sleeping simultaneously used for drying of laundry and improper storage of food, MOM said.  The foreign workers stayed in 31 makeshift rooms which were \"untidy and filthy\" with poor ventilation and inadequate lighting which were exacerbated by the overcrowded conditions, according to the ministry.  The rooms were also constructed from zinc sheets and plywood, which did not meet fire safety regulations, it said, adding that bulk and discarded items in the sleeping areas posed a fire hazard to workers.  In addition, the quarters had inadequate and poorly maintained toilet facilities, and there was just one communal bath for more than 200 workers to share in a makeshift bathroom.  \"The living conditions compromised the safety and well-being of the workers,\" MOM said in the press release.  The ministry said that after the inspection, the dormitory operator was ordered to rectify the poor living conditions and comply with the occupancy limit, with the excess foreign workers relocated to other approved accommodations. In total, Keong Hong pleaded guilty to 47 of 207 charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, with the remaining 160 charges taken into consideration for sentencing.  Ms Jeanette Har, MOM's Director of Well-Being Department, said that while the ministry has seen an improvement in the foreign worker housing landscape, some employers and operators continue to have little regard for workers’ safety and well-being.  \"MOM will take stern action against those who fall short of their legal responsibilities towards their foreign workers,\" she stated.  Foreign workers who have issues with their housing conditions should first bring the matter to the attention of their employers, MOM said.  If their employers fail to make improvements to the living conditions, they can seek advice from the Migrant Workers’ Centre by calling +65 6536 2692 or report the matter to MOM at +65 6438 5122.

Amid news that Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing easing production cuts, the global benchmark for oil pulled back to last trade around US$75 on Monday.  “Pump prices in Singapore have risen given the uptick in oil prices,” said OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan, while adding that the absence of petrol subsidies in Singapore translated into a strong correlation between the two.  “Hence, the uptick in oil prices and its effect on refined oil would likely be translated into the final pump prices.”  Agreeing, OANDA’s head of Asia-Pacific trade Stephen Innes said pump prices here could be in for more increases, with oil possibly reclaiming the US$80-mark within the next three to six months.  “The market right now is trading on a worst case scenario but I don’t see the OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) disbanding their deal on supply cuts yet.”  With global oil demand supported by robust economic growth, Mr Innes added: “One more supply disruption is all it takes for oil prices to rebound … And with the primary component of petrol being oil, if the price for that component goes up, petrol prices will naturally go in the same direction.”  To be sure, petrol companies do not use crude oil prices in their cost accounting and pricing decisions for pump petrol. The Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) prices, or wholesale prices of refined oil, is used instead.  Determined by markets research firm S&P Global Platts through market forces, the MOPS price has also been mirroring the increase in Brent crude, said its associate editorial director Jonathan Nonis.  However, motorists may be relieved to know that retail petrol is unlikely to see price increases of the same magnitude as global crude oil.  OCBC’s Mr Gan explained: “Petrol prices are less volatile than crude oil, meaning that a US$1 rise in crude oil prices may not necessarily inject an equal percentage rise in pump prices given sticky price assumption, and other factors such as refinery and distribution costs.”  These other factors also include rental and labour costs, duties, as well as currency differences, said UOB economist Francis Tan. As oil is traded in the US dollars, any strengthening in the greenback against the Singapore dollar will mean higher costs and vice versa.  There is also a “lag effect” to take note of, added Mr Tan.  “Even if oil prices go up this month, it will only be one to two months later when consumers feel the pain. This lag effect is due to how prices at the pumps are based on older inventories bought at a lower price.”  He added: “Pump prices are a function of many things, like the wholesale costs, changes in labour and rental costs. That’s why even if petrol prices are headed in the same direction as oil prices, they are less volatile and will not see the same magnitude of movements.”  PUMP PRICES IN LINE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS: RETAILERS When contacted by Channel NewsAsia, petrol companies that responded said their pricing strategies are driven by a myriad of factors, including competition dynamics, and are in line with market conditions.  SPC said it monitors the market regularly and does periodic adjustments to its pump prices and promotions “to reflect prevailing market conditions”. “SPC has always offered competitive pricing for our petrol and diesel products and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson said.  A spokesman from ExxonMobil said the company offers various discounts and offers, and distinguishes itself through its rewards programme and other promotional activities. “Pump prices at our service station network are in line with prevailing market conditions.”  Over at Chevron, which operates the Caltex brand here, the company said it believes in offering products at “fair, reasonable and competitive prices”. It added that adjustments to pump prices are based on “independent assessment and consideration” of factors, such as government taxes and duties.  Still, some motorists said they can’t help but worry about the increase in petrol prices.  In particular, taxi drivers and private-hire car drivers who clock long hours on the road. The latter may be among those that will feel the biggest pinch as petrol costs make up a significant portion of their expenses and are non-tax-deductible, unlike for cabbies. With spending on petrol coming up to S$800 a month and accounting for nearly 25 per cent of his monthly income, Mr Chan Choon Hock, 52, said he changed to a Toyota Prius last month, partly due to the hybrid car’s low fuel consumption. “So far from what I observe, this car can save me about half of what I usually spend and that is important because every cent adds up,” said the Grab driver.  While Mr Ramesh Arumugam said he has not felt the pinch so far, the 50-year-old cabby-turned-private-hire-driver will be keeping a close eye on petrol prices and discounts made available. “We are on the road most of the time so if prices continue to increase, we will be the ones who will feel the biggest impact,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/with-higher-oil-prices-how-much-more-will-it-cost-to-fill-up-10283062"}, {"datetime": "29 May 2018 06:44AM", "tags": ["inequality", "Singapore", "social mixing", "HDB", "IPS"], "author": "Kelly Ng", "title": "The Big Read: Social stratification — a poison seeping into Singapore’s housing estates and schools", "content": " SINGAPORE: For years, policymakers in Singapore have been focusing on ways to narrow the income gap, as countries around the world seek to mitigate the side effects of globalisation. Social inequality has become a buzz phrase among national discussions, and the issue remains a work in progress. Of late, however, a new phrase has entered the government's lexicon: Social stratification. It refers to an institutionalised system of social inequality — a dire situation that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned about in February, but one which is starting to take root and risks becoming entrenched, as several Cabinet Ministers and other Members of Parliament (MPs) highlighted during the five-day debate on the President's Address earlier this month. \"The issues of mitigating income inequality, ensuring social mobility and enhancing social integration are critical,\" PM Lee had said in a written parliamentary reply. \"If we fail – if widening income inequalities result in a rigid and stratified social system, with each class ignoring the others or pursuing its interests at the expense of others – our politics will turn vicious, our society will fracture and our nation will wither.\" And among the various aspects of social stratification, it is the \"perceptible reduction\" — in Education Minister Ong Ye Kung's words — in social mixing in recent years that has gotten some worried. National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser said: \"The lack of social mixing may translate into a lack of empathy for and understanding of those who hail from disadvantaged families … leading to a reluctance to support policies aimed at improving the lots of the lower classes, and contributing towards their welfare.\" This lack of mutual understanding could also lead to the \"emergence of distrust between classes, even class tension\", said Dr Tan, who co-authored the Institute of Policy Studies' (IPS) Study On Social Capital with IPS deputy director for research Gillian Koh and NUS sociologist Vincent Chua. For generations, social mixing has been a hallmark of Singapore society, thanks to the housing, education and National Service policies which encourage mixing across groups of different race, income and family backgrounds. But at least two of these three policy levers, which have carefully nurtured and reinforced the culture, are not working as well as before — or as they should be. The IPS study, which was supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, found that while there is social mixing between classes, \"there seems to be a gap along two dimensions of social stratification, that of housing and education,\" Dr Tan noted. READ: A commentary on inequality across neighbourhoods in Singapore.  READ: A commentary on bridging the class divide. Among other findings, the study — which was published last December — showed that on average, Singaporeans who live in public housing have fewer than one friend living in private housing. People who study in elite schools also tend to be less close to those in non-elite schools, and vice versa. Make no mistake about it, the issue is receiving attention at the highest level: In a bid to \"deliberately plan for a more equal and inclusive society\", the Housing and Development Board (HDB) has launched three Build-to-Order projects — in Woodlands, Bukit Batok and Sengkang — with rental and sold flats within the same block. The authorities will also continually renew buildings and infrastructure to avoid ending up in a situation \"where certain parts of Singapore are left to degrade and we end up with deteriorated neighbourhoods or towns, inhabited largely by lower-income or elderly residents\", National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament during the debate on the President's Address. Meanwhile, PM Lee told the House last week that the Ministry of Education (MOE) will work with Raffles Institution (RI) and other popular schools so that they never become \"self-perpetuating, closed circles\". The Government has also stressed, on several occasions, the need to level the playing field from preschool in order to tackle inequality. To that end, it is doubling its annual spending on the preschool sector to S$1.7 billion in 2022. HOUSING: RISK OF ENCLAVES Moving into the Ang Mo Kio neighbourhood a decade ago after her divorce, Ms Fadillah Abdul Rahman, 45, was taken aback by the lifestyles of the \"underdogs in Singapore's society\", and was fearful her children might wind up with bad company. She lives with two sons and a daughter in a two-room rental flat in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6. Her eldest daughter has moved out after getting married. True to her fears, her son, now 20, was admitted to a boys' home for several months for disciplinary issues. Still, the single mother wants to give her children the freedom to hang out with kids in the community. She also gives them free rein to manage their studies. Her daughter, 10, attends Ang Mo Kio Primary school, which is about a 20-minute walk or 15-minute bus ride away. Her eldest son, Mohd Zuhairi Zakariya, 21, works as a technician at a company providing wire bonding services in Yishun. From Mondays to Thursdays, he takes night classes at the Institute of Technical Education College Central and is working towards a Higher Nitec degree in mechanical engineering. Ms Fadillah said her daughter often plays at home or the playground in their neighbourhood. Once in a while, she would bring her to playgrounds further away, including those located near condominiums and private estates. But on such occasions, she noticed that there were hardly any children there from families living in the private homes. These children would probably play in the playgrounds located in their condominiums or be cooped up at home, she reckoned. Within the Ang Mo Kio/Yio Chu Kang precinct, a private housing estate at Lentor Street is situated just 2.5km away from the block of rental flats where Ms Fadillah and her children are staying. Homemaker Jacqueline Aw, 39, her husband and two daughters — aged 2 and 6 — are among the families living in the Lentor Street estate. Her elder daughter is enrolled in a NAFA Arts Preschool, the first arts-theme preschool in Singapore. The child also attends various enrichment classes in abacus, gymnastics, athletics, piano, dancing, as well as English and the Chinese language. Her girls do not play in the neighbourhood park, but instead enjoy going to the indoor playground at SAFRA in Toa Payoh and Punggol. Ms Aw, who grew up in a rental flat and knows of friends and family who have lived or are living in such units, said she is happy to visit them if they invite her family. Nevertheless, the former flight stewardess noted that her family does not know anyone living at the rental flats at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6. Acknowledging her children's privileged background, she added that she tries to inculcate the right values in them, such as being grateful for what life has given them. However, some families in Ang Mo Kio whom TODAY interviewed said they would steer clear of the rental flats. One resident, who only gave her name as Madam Tan, said she and her twins, both 7 years old, will avoid going near the rental flats as the people there may be \"less educated\", and the environment looks a bit \"scary\". Madam Tan works in a bank and her family lives in a five-room flat in Yio Chu Kang. The situation and prevailing sentiments among residents in Ang Mo Kio are mirrored across the island in various housing estates. Rental flat residents, for example, said they have few opportunities to interact with Singaporeans from different family backgrounds because their day-to-day activities are often confined within their neighbourhoods. The IPS study found that even though the vast majority of Singaporeans reside in public housing, private-home dwellers had more ties with others who live in private homes than with those who lived in public flats. In 1989, the Government implemented the Ethnic Integration Policy to prevent racial enclaves, by ensuring that each HDB block and estate broadly reflect the Republic's racial proportion. While the measure has largely met its aim, enclaves are now potentially forming along socioeconomic lines, experts said. Prior to the Government's recent announcement, there were no HDB blocks designed to house both rental and sold units. Flats under the public rental scheme are heavily subsidised to cater to needy households, whose total household income falls below S$1,500 per month and have no other housing options. According to the latest General Household Survey in 2015, 1- and 2-room flats are congregated in the Bukit Merah, Kallang and Ang Mo Kio planning areas, while a larger proportion of private houses are found in Bukit Timah, Bedok and Hougang. Figures from the Department of Statistics also show that while the proportion of Singaporeans living in condominiums has surged from 6.5 per cent to 15.6 per cent from 2000 to last year, the proportion living in 1- and 2-roomers has inched up from 5 to 5.8 per cent over the same period. Noting the aspirations of homeowners who desire more privacy for example, Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan said the growing proportion of gated communities could result in \"unintended consequences\", such as fewer chances for social mixing to take place. LIMITS OF 'FORCED MIXING' With a general decline of neighbourliness, more resources should be dedicated to organising community-based events such as block and street parties, in order \"to bring people out of their sanctuary and mix in common spaces\", Prof Straughan suggested. Such community activities go some way in bridging social divides between the rich and the poor, residents and MPs said. Over in the Jalan Kukoh neighbourhood in Bukit Merah, for instance, ground-up initiatives such as ReadAble and Catch Plus (Children and Teen Community Hub Plus) — which are targeted at students from low-income families — are often run by volunteers from more privileged backgrounds. Ms Lyn Razali, who lives in a two-room unit along Jalan Minyak, said Catch Plus has helped her two daughters and herself widen their social networks. The after-school care programme is targeted at students aged seven to 16 from low-income families in the neighbourhood. It focuses on the academic and socio-emotional aspects of their development. \"Through these activities, we have befriended Singaporeans who live in condominiums, and they invite us over to their homes. But ultimately, we are brought together through the community (regardless of) financial status,\" said Ms Razali, 38, whose husband works as a driver. The Catch Plus programme was the brainchild of Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo, who looks after some lower income households in the Jalan Kukoh area. Dr Neo noted that \"forced mixing\" is helpful only if the individuals themselves continue to foster their relationships beyond instituted activities. She added: I feel some people may be more comfortable and at ease sticking with their own groups… We can try out different programmes, but when I leave it to them, would they hang out together? They may or they may not. Some Singaporeans had mixed views on the extent to which social mixing and integration could be instituted. Public relations consultant Oo Gin Lee, 49, reiterated that it is \"only natural\" for people to interact with others with whom they share similar preferences and lifestyles — and these would likely still boil down to their spending powers, added Mr Oo, whose family lives in a condominium in Bukit Timah. Ms Lim Shaw Hui, 45, believes that schools are society's best shot at promoting social mixing from young. The mother of two sons aged 7 and 9 said she made a deliberate decision to enrol her children in a neighbourhood primary school. She added: It is too simplistic to think that hawker centres and playgrounds are sufficient to encourage mixing. SCHOOLS: THE GREAT SOCIAL LEVELLER BEING THREATENED? While Singapore's schools are seen as the most effective social levellers, there is growing concern that so-called elite primary and secondary schools coveted for their academic rigour could be disproportionately attracting students from affluent families. There is a need to relook some of the admission policies, some parents and experts said. Mr Oo pointed out that affiliation schemes which prioritise certain students for admission because their parents are alumni, or because they themselves graduated from primary schools within the same family of schools, widen the divide between institutions. Children whose families are living within a 1 to 2km radius are also given priority under existing policies. With some primary schools such as Henry Park Primary School, Singapore Chinese Girls' School and Methodist Girls' School located in or near a private estate, these schools tend to be \"homogenised\", said Prof Straughan. Such a policy has also created an unintended vicious circle: The high demand for places at prestigious schools drive up prices of nearby homes, with well to do families snapping up these flats. Speaking in Parliament last week, PM Lee cited his recent conversation with Mr Ong, where he was told that RI — which has a strong tradition of accepting students from diverse backgrounds, so long as they make the cut — has become \"less diverse\" over the years. To address this, the new RI principal, Mr Frederick Yeo, has been speaking to parents of potential students in primary schools across Singapore, to encourage them to apply to RI. To the principal's surprise, some of the parents told him they did not want to send their child there, because they feared he would not be able to fit in with other more well-off students, PM Lee said. But PM Lee stressed that the parents' fear was unfounded — in reality, RI students still come from varied backgrounds, with 53 per cent of its students living in public housing, and all the students \"get along confidently and comfortably\". In response to queries, MOE cited co-curricular activities (CCAs), inter-school camps and national school games as examples of opportunities that \"provide common spaces for students from diverse backgrounds to forge friendships\". Eight in 10 schools today have a \"relatively balanced mix\" of students, with at least 5 per cent of students from both the top and bottom socio-economic quintiles. \"MOE is committed to an inclusive education system which ensures that all students regardless of their background and abilities are given opportunities and support to realise their potential,\" said a ministry spokesperson. Several popular schools, including RI, Hwa Chong Institution and Methodist Girls' School, also cited inter-school projects as platforms for students to interact with peers from various backgrounds. However, most of these initiatives involve only a small group of students from each school. Parents who have kids in both an elite school and a neighbourhood school said they have observed a stark difference in their children's social networks. Mr Oo's eldest daughter goes to a popular girls' school in Bukit Timah, while her sister studies at a less well-known school in Telok Blangah. \"Their friends are so different. My second goes to an average school, and you can see that there is greater diversity,\" he said. \"When you look at (my eldest's peers), they are all rich. In the morning, the roads to her school are often congested because a larger majority of the parents drive their kids to this school.\" At the same time, examples abound of children from less affluent families who were able to get into the elite schools — but the feeling among observers is that the odds could be increasingly stacked against those from less privileged backgrounds, and the onus is on school leaders to ensure the pathways remain open to all. A parent, Ms Anne Soh, felt that students' socioeconomic backgrounds have a definite bearing on how well they do in schools. For example, those who are better off are exposed to enrichment classes from a young age, she noted. Both Ms Soh, 47, and her husband work in a church, earning a total of about S$4,000 each month. They live in a four-room flat at Ghim Moh with two sons and a daughter. Their eldest son, who is now 19, graduated from one of the top secondary schools and junior colleges here. Declining to be named, the son, who is a full-time national serviceman, said his friends from school came from \"fairly similar\" socioeconomic backgrounds, in contrast to his peers in the military. He said: In our society, it's hard to ensure mixing in schools when everything is based on academics … Because the richer you are, the more you can afford stuff like tuition. Ms Soh noted that at her second son's school, quite a number of students also come from well-to-do families. However, school leaders have placed a strong focus on taking in students with special needs and learning abilities, she said. They have instilled a culture of service to the community, and students are encouraged to share the values with their family members, she added. For example, the students organise annual community service trips which their fathers are also invited to participate in. Ms Lim suggested that schools conduct CCAs in clusters, based on their geographical locations, so that students with common interests can come together, despite their different backgrounds. Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Zainal Sapari mooted the idea of \"community schools\", which do away with cut-off points and affiliation priorities for admission. These schools could offer both primary and secondary education, he suggested. He said: We need to let our children interact with people not only from different backgrounds, but of various academic aptitudes. Instead, now, we are encouraging social stratification at a young age by streaming them, labelling some as 'gifted'. IT ALL STARTS AT HOME On her decision to enrol both her sons in a neighbourhood school, Ms Lim said she and her husband \"wanted them in an environment where they would get to mix around and widen their social circles\". \"We also did not want to put them in an 'elite' school because of the academic pressure,\" said Ms Lim, a part-time assistant director at Beyond Social Services. Having come from a privileged background herself, Ms Lim said this was why she wanted to ensure her children are exposed to people from all walks of life. Since young, her children would accompany their parents at fundraising events. They also visit and support a family living in a rental flat within their estate in Pasir Ris, said Ms Lim. These monthly visits over the last two years have helped her children forge a strong friendship with the other family's son, she added. Associate Professor Chua pointed out that volunteerism is \"an effective means to narrowing the inequality gap\". \"Networks are conduits for the flow of resources. Mentoring relationships (for instance, free tuition) are one example, they facilitate the sharing of resources, possibilities and synergies,\" he added. Some Singaporeans from lower-income households reiterated that there are sufficient opportunities for people like them to rise from the lower rungs of society, as well as mix with people from different socioeconomic groups. It is up to the individual, they said. Mr Mohd Zuhairi said: \"We are what we are … It is about how you want to change your life. You got to be hardworking and have a positive mindset. There are opportunities, but you must know what you want your life to be.\" Dr Tan stressed that family upbringing is critical: In a situation where a child is raised in a family which has \"socialised him or her to have low aspirations, to not take education seriously, to feel incapable of doing better and to see himself as a victim of circumstances\", the child is less likely to break out of his class background. A SOCIETAL EFFORT In his parliamentary speech, Mr Ong described tackling inequality as an \"unfinished business\". He noted that Singapore, like other nations, had wrestled with the problem of inequality in its early days. But its journey from Third World to First had created new forms of inequalities, said Mr Ong, who also cautioned that social stratification could \"poison\" the society over time. Overall, experts say the situation in Singapore is far from dire, but there are signs of social stratification taking root — and these need to be nipped in the bud. While Singaporeans have enjoyed \"a fairly upward mobility\" in the past, Prof Straughan cautioned against a growing discontent and unhappiness among the younger generation who may feel that it is \"almost impossible for them to reach for the stars\". Agreeing, Dr Tan said that if the \"class boundaries are not permeable\" and the chances of moving up are slim, the lower classes may feel \"a sense of hopelessness, discontentment, and envy\". Given the absence of longitudinal data on the topic, \"it is hard to say whether things are getting worse\", said Dr Tan. Nevertheless, the critical question is whether inequalities are \"systematically entrenched\", Prof Straughan reiterated. Addressing the issue publicly, several national leaders have noted that social stratification is a risk for developed societies. PM Lee, for example, pointed out that \"any society which has been stable for a long time tends to stratify\", citing the entrenched notions of class and caste in the United Kingdom and India. Assoc Prof Chua noted that \"an all-out meritocracy in the latter stages will produce the kinds of divides we are seeing\". To bridge these gaps, government policies are one thing. But the public at large has a role to play as well, in terms of attitudes and mindsets. Ultimately, \"friendships are a combination of context and choice\", Assoc Prof Chua said. \"The important thing would be to complement one's social circles with bridges to others. The best networks are those that are rich in variety,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-social-stratification-a-poison-seeping-into-10283526"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 11:01PM", "tags": ["Hyflux", "companies", "business"], "author": "Brandon Tanoto", "title": "Hyflux's court hearing for debt reorganisation scheduled for Jun 19", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore water treatment firm Hyflux on Monday (May 28) said that a hearing with respect to its application to commence a court-supervised process to reorganise its debt has been scheduled for Jun 19.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad confirmed in a press conference on Monday that Malaysia will drop the project, saying that it will not benefit his country.  Responding to Channel NewsAsia's queries, a Ministry of Transport spokesperson said: \"We had agreed to proceed with the HSR project based on mutual benefits and obligations set out in the HSR bilateral agreement.  \"We will wait for official communication from Malaysia.\" Mahathir had said several times in recent days that his government will review agreements made by the previous administration, including the HSR project, in order to trim a total debt that Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has said exceeds RM1 trillion. In an interview with the Financial Times on Monday, Mahathir said that the project, for which both countries signed an agreement in December 2016, will be dropped so that Malaysia can \"avoid being declared bankrupt\". \"We need to do away with some of the unnecessary projects, for example the high-speed rail, which is going to cost us RM110 billion and will not earn us a single cent,\" he said. This is despite earlier reports stating that the rail link was expected to contribute RM21 billion in gross domestic product to Malaysia and Singapore, as well as create 111,000 jobs by 2060. Mahathir has acknowledged that breaking the agreement will cost Malaysia \"a lot of money\". Mahathir had earlier said that Malaysia was going to look into how it could reduce the cost of any potential exit from the HSR project, and would discuss the matter with Singapore.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-not-received-official-notification-malaysia-hsr-drop-10284740"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 09:25PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "transport", "HSR"], "author": "", "title": "KL-Singapore HSR: What you need to know", "content": " SINGAPORE: Construction for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) line was due to start this year, but the project will now be postponed.  Singapore and Malaysia formally agreed to postpone construction until end-May 2020 on Wednesday (Sep 5). The new agreement was signed by Malaysia's Economic Affairs Minister Azmin Ali and Singapore's Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan at the Prime Minister's Office in Putrajaya, Kuala Lumpur, on Wednesday afternoon.  The signing was witnessed by Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, his Malaysian counterpart Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had announced in May that it would be scrapping the project, and later said in July that it would be deferred instead.  Here's what you need to know: WHAT DOES THE NEW AGREEMENT SAY? Under the new agreement, the express service of the HSR is expected to start by Jan 1, 2031 instead of Dec 31, 2026. Malaysia will also have to pay abortive costs amounting to about S$15 million before the end of January 2019 for suspending the project. Additionally, if Malaysia does not proceed with the project by May 31, 2020, it will also bear the agreed costs incurred by Singapore in fulfilling the HSR Bilateral Agreement, according to a joint statement by both countries on the matter. During the suspension period, both countries will \"continue to discuss on the best way forward for the HSR Project with the aim of reducing costs\", the statement said.  WHAT DOES THE PROJECT ENTAIL? Running for 350km, the planned HSR line has eight stops: Singapore, Iskandar Puteri, Batu Pahat, Muar, Melaka, Seremban, Sepang-Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur. Terminus stations are planned for Kuala Lumpur's Bandar Malaysia and Singapore's Jurong East. The line will host an express service from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, a domestic service from Kuala Lumpur to Iskandar Puteri and a shuttle service from Iskandar Puteri to Jurong East. In addition, co-located Singapore and Malaysia Customs, Immigration and Quarantine facilities are planned at Bandar Malaysia, Iskandar Puteri and Jurong East - meaning that a traveller at the Jurong East terminus could clear Singapore immigration and then Malaysian immigration a few steps later, before boarding the train and getting off in Kuala Lumpur. In Singapore, Raffles Country Club and Jurong Country Club have been acquired by the authorities for the project, with the latter meant to house the HSR terminus. HOW DID THE HSR PROJECT COME ABOUT? The proposed 350km-long HSR line aims to reduce travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to around 90 minutes by train, from the current 11 hours on existing train services. It was first unveiled in February 2013 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Najib at a leaders' retreat. The two countries signed a legally binding bilateral agreement on the project in 2016, paving the way for its implementation. Construction on the project - which was estimated to cost around RM50 billion (S$16.8 billion) to RM60 billion by Malaysia's then-second finance minister - was due to start this year, with the line expected to begin operations in 2026. WHAT WERE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS? Apart from slashing travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, it has been said the rail link is expected to contribute RM21 billion (S$6.7 billion) in gross domestic product to Malaysia and Singapore, as well as create 111,000 jobs by 2060. Separately, an environmental impact assessment report in 2017 had said that the long-term benefits for commuter safety and carbon emissions provide a \"strong justification\" for the project.​​​​​​​ KEEN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST  Under the project, both governments each took responsibility for developing, constructing and maintaining the civil infrastructure and stations within their own countries. Last year, Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced the formation of a wholly owned subsidiary - SG HSR - to implement the project and build, own, fund and maintain the civil infrastructure in Singapore. It would then work with its Malaysian counterpart, MyHSR, to jointly appoint an assets company and an international operator for the project through an open international tender. The project has attracted keen interest globally, with Japan’s ambassador to Malaysia saying earlier this year that the country could offer a “truly holistic” package towards the project. In addition to bidders from Malaysia and Singapore, others who have expressed an interest include firms from China, Japan, South Korea and Europe. WHY DID MALAYSIA SAY IT WOULD PULL OUT EARLIER? Dr Mahathir told reporters in May that the project was \"not beneficial\" to Malaysia, saying that the country would \"make no money at all\" from the arrangement.  In a separate interview with the Financial Times, he said the project would cost Malaysia RM110 billion (US$28 billion) but would not earn the country \"a single cent\".  In July, he then said his government will look to negotiate with Singapore the deferment of the project.  \"When we looked at the financial situation of the country we thought that we couldn't go ahead (with the HSR),\" he told reporters. \"But having studied it and the implication of unilaterally discarding the contract, we decided we may have to do it at a later date, we may have to reduce the price. But reduction of the price is very difficult as far as we can make out. So it has to be deferred.\" WHAT ABOUT THE RTS LINK? Separately, Malaysia and Singapore also have an agreement for a Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link which Prime Minister Lee has said will go on regardless of \"whoever is the government\" on either side. About S$3 billion had been set aside for the RTS Link and the HSR project in the Ministry of Transport's FY18 budget, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said in his Budget speech earlier this year. Editor's note: This story has been updated, following Malaysia's decision to postpone the HSR project. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/kuala-lumpur-singapore-hsr-rail-link-what-to-know-10284406"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 06:45PM", "tags": ["MAS", "securities", "finance"], "author": "", "title": "Investors to report short positions on SGX stocks from October", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore's central bank said on Monday (May 28) it will require investors to report short positions and short sell orders in securities listed on the Singapore Exchange from Oct 1 to improve transparency on such activities. Under the new rules, investors with short positions above the threshold of the lower of 0.2 per cent of total issued shares or S$2 million will have to report the positions to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). MAS said the rule will improve transparency on short selling activities in the market and enable investors to make more informed trading decisions. MAS will publish aggregated short positions of each security on Wednesday of each week. The rule was proposed initially in 2016 amid a growing number of public short-selling campaigns against listed companies in the region. Short selling involves the sale of a security that the seller does not own, or has borrowed, believing that the security's price will decline so that it can be profitably bought back at a lower price. Mr Jimmy Zhu, chief strategist at brokerage firm Fullerton Markets, said he viewed the move as a means to maintain stability in the financial markets. “Such moves from MAS may serve to avoid some unnecessary volatility driven by irrational speculators … We may see possible jitters in the second half of the year when the US Federal Reserve keeps its tightening bias.” Mr Zhu added that he did not think the new rules would have significant implications on investors and brokers. “Take for example, when China took some measures to stablise the forex market a few years ago, the underlying trend did not seem to change.  \"Over the long run, the trend of the benchmark Straits Times Index will still follow key regional markets and US stocks. Plus, short selling isn’t cheap in Singapore compared to other markets.” MAS said the new rules will also provide “statutory backing” to SGX’s trading rules, which already require securities brokers and banks to flag all investor short sell orders to the exchange. There will be no changes to the current arrangement for investors to inform their brokers when they submit short sell orders. The local bourse will continue to consolidate the short sell orders of each security and publish the information daily. However, Mr Jimmy Ho, president of the Society of Remisiers, said the new move could prove “disruptive” to remisiers. “They cannot be on their toes to do this while trading because it’s very interruptive. If there is a need to report any short position, can do so after market closure, let’s say maybe within a 1-hour timeframe, rather than doing it intraday. Maybe there can be a link between the reporting system by MAS and SGX so there is no need for doing double work.” Additional reporting by Brandon Tanoto. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sgx-investors-to-report-short-positions-on-stocks-october-10284352"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["employment", "Ministry of Manpower"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "New tripartite workgroup to study concerns of older workers", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new tripartite workgroup will be set up to look into the concerns of older workers and how to protect their interests as the resident workforce ages.  Announcing this during the Manpower Ministry’s annual workplan seminar, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that about one in three workers in Singapore today is above 50 and they have anxieties about the future, especially as technology disrupts businesses and jobs. Singapore is also facing a “demographic disruption” of an aging population with a shrinking working-age population, she added.  The workgroup will look into four areas: Ensuring older workers are valued, reviewing the retirement and re-employment age; considering Singapore’s next moves on retirement and re-employment age; and examining Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older workers and its impact on retirement adequacy. The workgroup will be chaired by Permanent Secretary for Manpower Aubeck Kam, and comprise National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) chief Ng Chee Meng, Singapore National Employers Federation’s president Robert Yap and Mrs Teo as advisors. Representatives from tripartite partners will also make up the workgroup.  “Should we continue to assume that most people do not work beyond age 64? In fact, brother Chee Meng asked a good question recently. Why should there be an expiry age for people’s desire or willingness to work?” Mrs Teo said at the seminar. “If so many countries will have older populations, how can we turn this into a competitive edge for our economy and society?” The setting up of a committee to better support older workers was first mooted by Mr Ng during his first speech in Parliament as deputy secretary-general of NTUC in response to the President’s Address. He also proposed expanding the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) by the National Trades Union Congress to extend more help to low-wage workers. The programme, which is managed by NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), will be expanded to support more companies in efforts to raise productivity and to make sure they take care of low-wage workers.  Businesses enrolled in the IGP are given incentives to redesign jobs and make technological upgrades, and have to share these productivity gains with low-wage workers. Mrs Teo said that the programme, launched in 2010, has benefitted more than 2,500 employers and 113,000 workers. “The Government fully supports this push. The IGP goes beyond wage improvements but also addresses concerns about the skills development and career progression of low-wage workers. MOM will work with NTUC to enhance IGP and look into other possibilities to ensure that low-wage workers are also part of our nation’s progress,” she said.  NEW SKILLSFUTURE FOR BUSINESSES TO BOOST HUMAN CAPITAL CAPABILITIES A one-year pilot SkillsFuture for Enterprises (SFE) initiative was also announced at the seminar. The initiative aims to help employers build human capital development capabilities. SFE will guide companies in putting in place human resource systems, structures and processes, and help transform existing practices to provide better training and development for their employees. It will be implemented through a network of intermediaries such as trade associations and chambers and HR consultancies. They will provide end-to-end assistance to employers and diagnose their current capabilities.  SNEF will be MOM’s first partner for the initiative, and it hopes to engage 1,000 companies across the 23 Industry Transformation Map sectors.  It will expand to a full roll-out of 10,000 companies over the next five years. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-older-workers-tripartite-workgroup-mom-10284234"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 05:41PM", "tags": ["Malaysia", "HSR", "Mahathir Mohamad"], "author": "", "title": "Mahathir confirms Malaysia will scrap KL-Singapore HSR project", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad confirmed in a press conference on Monday (May 28) that Malaysia will drop the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail project (HSR), saying the project will not benefit his country. \"It is a final decision, but it will take time because we have an agreement with Singapore,\" Dr Mahathir said. \"It's not beneficial.

Speaking at the ministry’s workplan seminar, Ms Teo said: “I want to reassure Swee Say that MOM is firmly committed to do everything we can and work with tripartite partners to keep it special for Singapore.” Mr Lim’s “passion for tripartism” is one of the most memorable qualities about him, said Mrs Teo. “When confronted by hostile companies who resisted unionisation, he did not give up trying to get the Labour movement a foot in the door. He encouraged the companies to get to know the unions through General Branch membership for their staff,” said Mrs Teo. And when Singapore brought in integrated resorts, Mr Lim “systematically built up the Attractions, Resorts and Entertainment Union (AREU), which now has over 12,000 members,” she added. He also championed tripartism overseas. “For example, soon after Singapore’s quick recovery from the global financial crisis, he arranged for a special meeting at International Labour Conference in Geneva in 2010 for participants from all over the world to explain to them how tripartism had helped in our recovery,” she said.  Mrs Teo also said that Mr Lim has a knack for breaking down ideas down to their essence and communicating them in a catchy way. During the global financial crisis, for example, he urged companies not to “cut jobs to save costs” but instead to “cut costs to save jobs”. Mr Lim will also be remembered for his breakthrough approaches to age-old problems, said Mrs Teo. When Mr Lim was secretary-general of NTUC, he pushed for progressive wages instead of minimum wages “so there’s not just a wage floor but a wage ladder”, and advanced the idea of re-employment age, she added.  As Manpower Minister, Mr Lim strengthened the Fair Consideration Framework and talked about local-foreign complementarity. Mrs Teo also joked that Mr Lim used golf to \"terrorise\" employers, and broke many a deadlock on the golf course as it allowed them to build a level of trust. “There is really no way we can thank Swee Say enough for all that he has done for the Labour Movement, Government, tripartism, Singapore’s economic development and water security,” she said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government-is-fully-committed-to-tripartism-josephine-teo-10283992"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 01:32PM", "tags": ["security", "Shangri-La Dialogue"], "author": "", "title": "Tighter security, special traffic arrangements during Shangri-La Dialogue", "content": " SINGAPORE: Expect tighter security around Shangri-La Hotel from Friday (Jun 1) to Sunday in light of the 17th Shangri-La Dialogue taking place at the hotel, said police in news release.

It also said it has outlasted competitors before when asked to comment on Indonesian rival Go-Jek's impending expansion to Singapore and other regional markets. For the Singapore launch of the GrabFood app, the company said it has signed up thousands of merchants to be on its service platform, including A Poke Theory, Hock Lam Beef Noodles, Ji De Chi, McDonald's, Wing Zone and Yum Cha restaurant. Asked to elaborate on the number of merchants and delivery people available, Mr James Ong, head of GrabFood Singapore, said during the media briefing there must be a balance between both. Too few delivery people, and consumers will get their food late, while too many will mean there will not be enough jobs to go around, he explained.  \"As we grow demand, we will grow supply,\" Mr Ong added. He also mentioned that there will be no minimum order requirement for consumers - a feature similar to the now-defunct Uber Eats. This is a \"strong lever\" to shape consumer behaviour but as the service evolves, it could be offered to certain segments of the customer base while others would get other targeted promotions, he explained. GrabFood will also be linked to its GrabRewards loyalty platform, with Grab saying it will offer five GrabRewards points for every dollar spent on a GrabFood order. Other regional markets to have GrabFood include Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, the company added in its press release. INSURANCE FOR DELIVERY STAFF Besides consumers, the company also said it will insure all on-the-job delivery staff at no additional cost to \"protect them in the event of an unfortunate accident\". Those delivering for GrabFood will also not need to pre-book their delivery slots, and all earnings for the day can be cashed out on the same day, the company added. The GrabFood app is available now in beta, which Mr Ong explained is to let users know the company will be making many changes to the app to improve the service based on the feedback it receives. It supersedes the Uber Eats app, which was officially shut off at 11.59pm on Sunday, according to Grab Singapore head Lim Kell Jay during the same briefing.

The committee proposed to enhance the severe disability insurance scheme, which will be renamed CareShield Life and implemented it in 2020, after the Government accepted the committee's recommendations. Speaking on 938NOW's Talkback programme, Mr Mah said CareShield Life will offer higher cash payouts of at least S$600 per month for the rest of an individual's life after a successful claim is made, as compared to just six years under ElderShield. “But based on the statistics we’re seeing, in the future, as many three in 10 of those who suffer disabilities may live longer than 10 years,” he said. “So, if you think about it, if you are disabled and you live for a long time, a lifetime payout is indeed a very significant assurance.\" CareShield Life will be compulsory and, unlike ElderShield, individuals will not be able to opt out. Mr Mah said it is designed to offer basic, universal protection for all Singaporeans, and those who wish to supplement it with further private insurance plans are encouraged to do so. The first cohort of Singaporeans to be automatically covered by CareShield Life — including those with pre-existing disabilities —  are those aged 30 to 40 in 2020. But Mr Mah said the scheme is also open to older Singaporeans born before 1980. CareShield Life does not automatically include older individuals because some of them have opted out of ElderShield, and it would be unfair to force them back in, he said. Moreover, people who join the scheme later in life will have to pay higher premiums. “But, having said that, with the CareShield Life scheme being much more enhanced, we're encouraging everyone to come back on to the scheme,” said Mr Mah. “We're also recommending to the government to help provide some support for this group of people who at some point in time would like to opt back in.” HIGHER PREMIUMS FOR WOMEN Different groups of Singaporeans will be charged different CareShield Life premiums. This is especially the case for women, who will pay higher premiums. ElderShield Review Committee member, Fang Eu-Lin, explained on 938NOW that this is because women tend to live longer, and have a higher chance of requiring long-term care for disabilities. “We debated very much on this topic. In fact, many men in the committee also raised it as a concern,” she said.  “So, we did our research, and found that it’s a mixed bag in other countries. Some have the same premiums for males and females, and some have higher premiums for females. But what is the most important, is to have a fair and inclusive outcome, and females who are not able to afford their premiums will get government support,” said Ms Fang. The committee also addressed concerns about difficult claims processes. “We’re recommending that, for example, people who are suffering from stroke and are clearly disabled, let’s not make it so difficult for them. Don't make them go through annual re-assessment, because they are already permanently disabled,” Mr Mah said. While everyone will have to go through an assessment, he said this should happen only once.  “We’re also recommending to increase the pool of assessors. Right now, the pool is limited to doctors. We’re recommending that we include nurses and occupational therapists as qualified assessors so that the claims process can be much easier.” The committee has also recommended a “one-stop shop”, an agency that is able to keep track of claimants. This way, once the individual’s record is with the agency, the information can be shared across all hospitals, and this should make the claims process easier as well, said Mr Mah. Acknowledging that there are a lot of details in CareShield Life for people to absorb, Ms Fang said one challenge over the next few months would be for greater outreach efforts. “Given that the starting age for CareShield Life is 30, we really want to engage younger Singaporeans, through platforms such as the National Youth Council, the People’s Association, and even workplaces that have many young people,” she said.  “If you look at the overall scheme, it is an improved scheme, compared to ElderShield, in terms of the amount of premium you pay, versus what you’ll get in terms of payouts. So, it’s really about understanding the details.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/careshield-life-eldershield-chaly-mah-lifetime-payouts-assurance-10283188"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 11:04AM", "tags": ["South Korea", "Donald Trump", "Moon Jae-in", "Kim Jong Un"], "author": "", "title": "South Korea's Moon Jae-in may join Trump, Kim for Singapore summit: Report", "content": " SEOUL: South Korean President Moon Jae-in could join US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore for a three-way summit next month.

Moon raised the suggestion again on Sunday, one day after he held a second, surprise meeting with Kim.\"Should the North Korea-US summit succeed, I would like to see efforts to formally end the (Korean) war through a three-way summit of the South, the North and the US,\" Moon told a press briefing. Trump said on Sunday a US team had arrived in North Korea to prepare for a proposed summit between him and Kim, which Trump pulled out of last week before reconsidering. In addition to those talks, the White House said a \"pre-advance team\" left for Singapore - where the summit has been expected to take place - on Sunday morning to work on logistics. Yonhap initially reported that the North Korean official on his way to Singapore was Ri Son Gwon. It later amended its report to say that the official was Kim Chang Son, the de facto chief of staff to Kim, and he is leading the country's delegation to discuss the logistics and security issues for the summit. He arrived in Beijing on Monday and was expected to take a Singapore-bound flight late in the afternoon. A South Korean lawmaker has said that Kim may also stop over in Beijing en route to Singapore. Park Jie-won, an opposition lawmaker, told a radio programme that Kim's private jet appears to have problems flying the distance directly and is likely to stop in China. \"I expect that Kim could meet with Xi again when he stops in China before heading to Singapore,\" Yonhap reported Park as saying. Moon also said on Monday that there could be more impromptu talks with North Korea, including summits between pre-arranged dialogue.  \"What's more important than anything from the latest inter-Korean summit was that the leaders easily got in contact, easily made an appointment and easily met to discuss urgent matters, without complicated procedures and formalities, just like a casual meeting,\" Moon told a meeting with senior secretaries. \"If we could hold working-level, back-to-back talks on both sides of Panmunjom if urgently necessary in addition to formal summits, it would expedite advancement of inter-Korean relations,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/trump-kim--moon-jae-in-north-south-korea-may-join-singapore-10283120"}, {"datetime": "28 May 2018 10:06AM", "tags": ["Trending", "Parenting"], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "From puppet shows to playgrounds: 13 places to bring your kids during the June school holidays", "content": " Follow our new CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: The school holidays are back and this can only mean one thing for parents: For the next few weeks, keeping the young ones busy and occupied is entirely in your hands.

Here are some options on what to do and where to bring them. 1. TAME A DINOSAUR  If the children have dino fever because of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, take them to Universal Studios Singapore’s Jurassic World: Explore & Roar. Besides taking selfies with the “dinosaurs” and prop replicas (remember the Gyrosphere those two kids were in when they were attacked by Indominus Rex?), five- to 12-year-olds can also sign up for Raptor Training School.  The little ones will be thrilled by a live-action show complete with swooping Pteranodons and a T-Rex containment breach. If that’s not enough interaction with the prehistoric world, head for the Jurassic Encounter, where they can see how they’d measure up against Triceratops and other dinosaurs through augmented reality magic.  All special programmes for Jurassic World: Explore & Roar are included with regular admission tickets. Singapore residents can purchase a one-day adult ticket at S$68.  Until Aug 22 at Universal Studios Singapore; rwsentosa.com 2. HAVE FUN AT THE PLAYGROUND  The National Museum of Singapore’s current exhibition looks at the history of Singapore’s playgrounds – and it’s a pretty interactive one that’s perfect for your kids.

Armed with needle and thread, she has enshrined her impressions of everything from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, to the haphazard buildings of Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City and the farmland at her grandparents’ home in Germany, in intricately embroidered pieces. All together, the 27-year-old has more than 40 of these charming travel “snaps” in her ever-growing Sew Wanderlust series. Three years after her works caught the attention of international media, Ms Lim, known by the moniker Teeteeheehee, has scored an impressive list of clients as an embroidery artist. It includes the likes of Gucci, Uniqlo, Melissa Shoes, Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport and even Netflix. SEW FAR, SEW GOOD Speaking to Channel NewsAsia in her workshop in her family HDB maisonette, Ms Lim shared that being an embroidery artist was never the plan for her. The Fashion Design and Textiles graduate from LASALLE College of the Arts said unlike most of her peers, she did not dive into a job search immediately after graduation. Instead, she gave herself a year to focus solely on embroidery, a medium she had picked up in school. “I think that was very important because when you don’t put pressure on yourself. That’s where you grow and understand yourself more. “I wasn’t very sure what I wanted to do, but I was always very sure what I did not want to do,” she said, referring to a corporate job, which she thought was humdrum. As expected, her choice to pursue art as a career was met with scepticism from her parents. While she received well-meaning advice that she might not go far and that she should stick to a more secure job, she was not deterred. “I cannot imagine myself going through life like that. I would rather suffer doing something I like than being safe and not enjoying what I do,” Ms Lim said. And suffer she did. She recalled being financially strapped in her first year, while she was jobless and without a steady income. She did not want to rely on her parents either, in a bid to prove them wrong. When she realised she was down to her last fifty dollars, she decided to start giving lessons on playing the violin, a skill that her mother — a piano teacher — had inspired her to pick up from young. Ms Lim indicated she’s embraced the harsh realities of being an artist in Singapore. “Ultimately, art in Singapore is not mainstream. There is no fixed income. We don’t know when we will get a big project and then nothing for three months,” she said. \"Realistically speaking, when you worry too much about whether you can feed yourself, that can drown out the passion. Once you have that sorted out, you can have the space and mental capacity to create.” Today, she brings home a comfortable income through commissioned works for brands looking for artwork for their campaigns or individuals looking for customised portraits. A basic embroidered portrait is priced at S$250, while more elaborate pieces can cost up to S$550. “When you do something you like, it can only take you to good places. People can see it reflected in your work and naturally people are drawn to it,” Ms Lim said. Today, Ms Lim describes her work as “telling stories” or “capturing moments through thread”. “I like to encourage discussion, but I’m not very good with words, so I let my work speak for itself,” she added. Her first personal project, the Sad Girls Club, was a series of embroidered illustrations depicting the sadness she felt when she went through a breakup. She published her work periodically on Instagram and built up a following, with some people reaching out to tell her that they could relate to her work. From there, Ms Lim’s passion for storytelling emerged. She moved on to address bigger issues in her next series, The Twelve Rooms, after overhearing a group of schoolgirls comparing their bodies to that of perfectly sculpted models on magazine covers. It struck a chord with Ms Lim who remembered feeling that way when she was younger. She also took inspiration from personal stories of some of her followers. Said Ms Lim of the project: “I started this series as a kind of conversation with my younger self. When you’re young, you think nobody understands you so you don’t share much and in the whole process you feel very alone. “What I hope to do is encourage discussion. There is power in knowing that someone who has been through all that is looking back and saying ‘It’s okay to feel this way’.” This year, she is busy with a personal project tackling the issue of excessive plastic use. Inspiration for it came when she realised she could never escape the use of plastics in her daily life, even when she tried to avoid it. She now collects what she terms ‘accidental plastics’ – bits and bobs of plastic items she uses without consciously asking for them. She hopes to incorporate all these plastics into an embroidered piece that depicts the ocean by the end of the year. Asked what the way forward for her is, Ms Lim said: “I always get that question, but I don’t even know what I’m going to do tomorrow. “I will always be embroidering, just that the subject matter or the stories that I tell will evolve. Every year, I am excited to see what I will discover the next year.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teeteeheehee-teresa-lim-embroidery-artist-10277992"}, {"datetime": "27 May 2018 11:26PM", "tags": ["Kim Jong Un", "North Korea", "offbeat"], "author": "", "title": "'Kim Jong Un' poses for selfies in Singapore ahead of Trump summit", "content": " SINGAPORE: Surprised Singaporeans pursued North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Sunday (May 27) before realising the portly man with slick black hair near the Marina Bay Sands hotel was an impersonator. \"It looked like the real Kim Jong Un, but later I realised it's not the real one,\" said Sagar Admuthe who was visiting from Mumbai, India, after several selfies with the doppleganger against a backdrop of the city's bay. \"When you see him, it's very difficult to make out.\" The Australian-Chinese man posing as the North Korean leader calls himself only Howard X and said he was appearing to wish success for a summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to the North's nuclear programme.

Here is what you should know about the enhanced scheme, to be called CareShield Life.  1) It is an enhanced version of ElderShield, a long-term severe disability insurance scheme, and is only available to those born in 1980 and after. MOH plans to implement the plan in 2020.  2) The scheme will include those with pre-existing severe disabilities, and start at the age of 30 instead of 40 under ElderShield. It will be compulsory, unlike ElderShield, which allowed opt-outs.  3) Severely disabled policyholders under CareShield Life will get payouts for their whole lives. The payout will be at least S$600 a month. The potential payout will increase over time, until the policyholder reaches the age of 67, or makes a successful claim. This will come with premiums that also increase over time.  4) The Government will provide three types of premium subsidies - permanent means-tested that will benefit up to two-thirds of households, transitional subsidies for Singaporeans for the first five years amounting to a total of S$250, and additional support for those who cannot afford the premiums even with the other subsidies.  5) The Government will administer CareShield Life, as opposed to private insurers. The cost of the first disability assessment will be waived regardless of outcome. Other than accredited General Practitioners, there will also be additional healthcare professionals who will be able to make the assessment.  6)  Existing ElderShield policyholders can join CareShield Life from 2021.

The enhanced scheme, called CareShield Life, will provide lifetime coverage and higher payouts that increase over time for Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 30 and older who are severely disabled. This will need to be supported by higher premiums, the Ministry of Health said on Friday (May 25). For example, a 40-year-old male will pay S$25 monthly in premiums at the launch of the scheme before subsidies under the enhanced scheme compared to about S$15 under the current ElderShield scheme. The starting premium for a 40-year-old female will be S$30 in monthly premiums under CareShield Life. However, up to two-thirds of households will be eligible for permanent means-tested subsidies of up to 30 per cent. Two criteria will be used for means testing: monthly Per Capita Household Income (PCHI) and annual value (AV) of residence. For example, a Singaporean with a monthly PCHI of S$1,100 and below, will get a 30 per cent subsidy. If he has a PCHI of between S$1,101 and S$1,800, he will get a 25 per cent subsidy, and 20 per cent if the PCHI is between S$1,801 and S$2,600. These rates are based on AV of S$13,000 and less. Permanent Residents will receive half the rate offered to Singaporeans. TRANSITIONAL SUBSIDIES, ADDITIONAL PREMIUM SUPPORT The Government will also give Singaporeans transitional subsidies for the first five years of the scheme.  This will amount to S$250. For the first five years of scheme's implementation, payouts and premiums will both increase by 2 per cent per year. Additional premium support will also be given to those in financial need and unable to pay despite these subsidies. These premiums are fully payable by Medisave. The Government’s support package comes after it accepted recommendations by the ElderShield Review Committee that premiums should be kept affordable and adjusted regularly to account for changes in payout quantum and claims experience. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that the Government will include subsidies and incentives to encourage older cohorts to participate in CareShield Life. “This is an important part of our social safety net for Singaporeans in terms of long term-care needs. This also reflects the inclusive society that we aspire to build,” he said. An independent council will be set up to advise on subsequent payout and premium adjustments. “With these measures, CareShield Life premiums will be affordable for all Singapore residents. No one enrolled in CareShield Life will lose coverage due to financial difficulties,” MOH said. CareShield Life and ElderShield help policyholders who cannot independently perform at least three of six activities of daily living (ADL) - washing, dressing, feeding, using the toilet, moving around and the ability of transferring oneself from a bed to a chair. When asked by reporters why the number of ADLs was not decreased to two to help more people, chairman of the review committee Chaly Mah said that it would increase premium amounts by 30 per cent, making it less affordable. Mr Gan said; \"The Government is committed to ensuring that the premium will always be affordable. It will take into account personal savings, personal wealth, means as well as balance in Medisave, and what subsidies the Government can offer.\". ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government-to-provide-premium-subsidies-for-careshield-life-10281950"}, {"datetime": "27 May 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["ElderShield", "Gan Kim Yong", "CareShield Life"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "Higher, lifetime severe disability payouts for those joining CareShield Life", "content": " SINGAPORE: The severely disabled who join an enhanced ElderShield scheme from 2020 will receive lifetime payouts as long as their condition continues, following recommendations by the scheme’s review committee. This is an improvement over the six-year limit to payouts under the ElderShield scheme, which will continue in its present form for existing policyholders. Under the enhanced scheme, to be called CareShield Life, the severely disabled will also receive higher cash payouts of at least S$600 per month. The monthly payouts that people will be eligible for when they become disabled will increase over time.  This is above the S$300 or S$400 monthly flat amount provided under the ElderShield scheme. The higher monthly payouts that people are eligible for are expected to increase by 2 per cent per year for the period that premiums are being paid, subject to regular review by an independent council. It will be supported by regular premium adjustments to account for inflation.  The increases in potential payouts will, however, end once premium payments stop at the age of 67, or when someone makes a successful claim and starts receiving payments, whichever is earlier. Announcing that the Government has accepted the recommendations made by the committee, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (May 25) that it plans to implement CareShield Life in 2020. Those aged 30 to 40 in 2020 will be the first to join the scheme, which will be compulsory. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that the review of ElderShield is an important step in preparing Singapore for an ageing population. \"They (the committee) have worked very hard and consulted widely and put up a balanced set of recommendations that will significantly enhance ElderShield,\" he said. CareShield Life and ElderShield help policyholders who cannot independently perform at least three of six activities of daily living - washing, dressing, feeding, using the toilet, moving around and movements such as transferring oneself from a bed to a chair. A person under CareShield Life who has paid full premiums and becomes severely disabled at age 67 and remains so for 10 years, would receive a total of S$144,000 in monthly payouts of S$1,200, about 12 times the premiums paid. This is based on payout and premium increase of 2 per cent per year, and  would be better than the S$28,000 that would have been paid under ElderShield. During a media briefing on the committee’s recommendations on Friday, chairman Chaly Mah said that lifetime payouts would give the severely disabled assurance and certainty that they will be taken care of. “When we look at how we take care of those who are severely disabled, there’s a sense that we need to do more for that category,” he said. He also pointed to figures that one in two healthy Singaporeans aged 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime. In deriving the initial payout of S$600, he said the committee looked at whether Singaporeans have enough in their Medisave account, and considered basic long-term care costs in a nursing home and for home and community care, factoring in co-payment. For example he said, fees at nursing homes run by voluntary welfare organisations come up to S$2,400 per month. After Government subsidies and payouts from the enhanced scheme, the claimant or family member would have to pay S$400. His committee’s recommendations, which centre around inclusivity, better protection, affordable premiums and improving administration, came after a review that lasted about 18 months.  Currently, all Singaporeans and PRs with Medisave accounts are automatically enrolled in ElderShield at the age of 40, unless they opt out of the scheme. MOH said that existing ElderShield policy holders can choose to join CareShield Life from 2021, and that the Government is looking into measures to encourage and support them in doing so. A MORE INCLUSIVE SCHEME THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY THE GOVERNMENT Mr Mah had in January this year given an interim update on recommendations. Following the final recommendations that were accepted by the Government, CareShield Life will, in the future, be universal for Singapore residents, starting from the age of 30. This means that CareShield Life will cover everyone in future cohorts, including those with pre-existing severe disabilities. Under the current scheme, those with severe disabilities are not included. The Government will also administer the enhanced scheme on a not-for-profit basis, instead of the three private insurers who administer ElderShield. In addition, the claims and disability assessment processes will be simplified. Instead of navigating the claims process on their own, policyholders can seek advice from staff at hospitals or long-term care providers, the committee said. Disability assessment done by qualified professionals can also be used for the enhanced scheme, and this pool of professionals will be expanded through the inclusion of occupational therapists, physiotherapists and nurses, the committee added. The first-time disability assessment fee will also be waived, regardless of outcome, with fees for subsequent assessment that result in successful claims reimbursed. Dr Loh Yik Hin, chairperson of the claim assessment sub-committee, said that the whole intention of trying to improve the care assessment process was to reduce pain points. “Many of the policyholders didn’t know whether they were covered by ElderShield, and who their insurer was, and they couldn’t find out easily,” he said. The new framework will also give assessors explicit guidance on how to assess the lack of functional ability due to cognitive impairments such as dementia. “The committee’s recommendations will offer better protection and greater assurance for Singapore residents.

In 2015, Mr Justo was jailed in Thailand for blackmailing PetroSaudi International and threatening to make public information gleaned from his time at the company.  STRAITS TIMES SCOOP IN JUL 2015 On Jul 24, 2015, the Straits Times published an exclusive interview by its then Indo-China bureau chief Nirmal Ghosh with Mr Justo, who claimed he was offered US$2 million by a group of people for the data he had obtained from PetroSaudi.  Mr Justo alleged that the group intended to “modify the documents” so that it could “bring down the Malaysian government” of then prime minister Najib Razak.  Mr Justo was never paid, the Straits Times said in its story.  The Edge said this so-called group was principally Sarawak Report editor Clare Rewcastle-Brown, The Edge Media Group chairman Tong Kooi Ong, and CEO and publisher Ho Kay Tat.  “I immediately responded by admitting we did not pay Justo,” Mr Ho wrote in an article in The Edge on Friday as part of a 24-page report on 1MDB. He added that he had denied that the group was involved in a plan to topple Mr Najib’s government by publishing fake news about it.  “I said we were only out to get to the bottom of 1MDB’s financial woes and we had found from what Justo had shown us that a scam had taken place,” he wrote.  HIDDEN HAND?  Mr Ho said he had asked the Straits Times in 2015 if there was a “hidden hand” involved in its story with Mr Justo, as even Malaysian police could not even interview him at the high security prison in Thailand.  “I suggested that the Straits Times bosses find out more from Nirmal about the people who arranged the interview with Justo. Whether they ever did so, I don’t know,” wrote Mr Ho.  On Friday, The Edge reported that Mr Justo said he was told what to say to the Straits Times in order to secure an early release from prison.  “He said after he was arrested and charged for blackmail, he was kept in a lockup with 50 others, and everyone was virtually sleeping on top of each other,” said Mr Ho.  “After a week, he was told he had a choice – either to cooperate or expect to languish in jail for many years. He was also told he would be out in less than a year if he agreed to make confessions that were prepared for him.” Mr Justo named the \"hidden hands\" as PetroSaudi director Patrick Mahony and Paul Finnegan, a UK private detective who disguised himself as a Scotland Yard detective, according to The Edge.  Mr Justo had reportedly said he was handed “a list of 50 questions and answers that (he) was supposed to use” just before his interview with Mr Ghosh.  “Everything I told him was prepared by them (Mahony and Finnegan) and I was also told not to bring up the name Jho Low,” The Edge quoted Mr Justo as saying.  Mr Justo was freed from prison in an amnesty in 2016. He could have faced seven years in jail if he was found guilty of extortion.  “REPORTED HIS REMARKS ACCURATELY”  In response, Mr Ghosh said the story was done in good faith and reported accurately.  “If Justo's new claims are true, they are disappointing,” said Mr Ghosh in a statement printed in the Straits Times.  “I pursued the story as a professional journalist, trying various ways to get details on the case and access to Mr Justo. I put in a request to his Thai lawyer for an interview.  “When I was told by the lawyer I could interview him, I proceeded in good faith and reported his remarks accurately. More often than not, in interviews newsmakers tell their side of the story. This seemed no different. “Whatever deals Mr Justo had made, or what his deeper calculation was, I was unaware of. To verify the claims and as per good journalistic practice, we asked for reactions from key people he named - and we used their reactions as well.\" Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez said the newspaper approached the story in a professional manner.  \"Every news organisation was pursuing this story and trying to get to speak to Justo,” he said in the Straits Times.  “Nirmal managed to get access, and got the story. He did a professional and creditable job. That was our only purpose in running this story.\" Mr Fernandez added: “Our approach to this story was standard and professional.”  JUSTO ASSISTING MACC, MET WITH NEW PM MAHATHIR On Thursday, Mr Justo met with investigators at Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) shortly before Mr Najib gave a second round of statements at the anti-graft agency.  Defeated at the May 9 general election, Mr Najib was summoned to explain suspicious transfers of RM42 million from 1MDB subsidiary SRC International into his bank account.  On May 20, Mr Justo had a surprise meeting with new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.  \"What a great privilege and what an incredible moment!\" he wrote in a Facebook post. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/straits-times-responds-after-1mdb-whistleblower-xavier-justo-10282008"}, {"datetime": "27 May 2018 02:53PM", "tags": ["Education", "PSLE", "Ong Ye Kung", "school", "Heng Swee Keat"], "author": "Ng Chia Wee", "title": "Commentary: Scrap PSLE? The Singapore education system is not a free lunch", "content": " SINGAPORE: In public policy, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Due to limited time and resources, choosing to do something means choosing not to do another. In his speech to Parliament last week, Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung gave his thoughts on various policy suggestions such as the abolition of streaming and the PSLE. The underlying theme was clear: All policy decisions involve trade-offs. Most Singaporeans seem to understand intuitively that there is no such thing as a free lunch in policymaking. At the same time, the way many of us talk about changing the education system seems to suggest that we have unconsciously “exempted” the education system from the idea that there is no free lunch. Mr Ong had remarked that the “voice of the people” offers a diversity of views, conflicting and complex. If I may add to his words, even a single individual can unconsciously hold conflicting views. For example, many of us would like examinations which assess students’ depth of understanding rather than ability to memorise. At the same time, we lament about “strange” questions in national examinations and express our frustration at how it seems to be getting harder to do well in exams. READ: Are we still missing the point of education? A commentary. READ: Can a love for learning be sustained in a competitive education system? A commentary. There is no such thing as a free lunch: Top-level learning outcomes are often related to “difficult” tasks such as analysis and evaluation and the integration of different concepts. Difficult questions are in fact assessing students on genuine depth of understanding. Are we willing to forgo that? The point is, if we want a policy change, we must be able to name and justify what we are trading off. DEEPENING OUR DISCUSSION An inadequate understanding of tradeoffs in the education system is hampering our education discourse. Every policy decision has consequences and every argument proposing major changes can be responded to by simply highlighting the negative consequences. Often, this is where the discourse ends.   It need not be so. If they are serious about their proposals, those who seek major policy changes should respond to critics by substantiating why a certain consequence is justified. This would then prompt those who oppose said changes to review and clarify why it is not justified. This may then lead to a deeper discussion, where we move from merely describing the benefits and costs to resolving why certain trade-offs are worth incurring, and coming to a common consensus on the way forward. As much as policy changes are about what we want (benefits), they are also about what we are willing to forego (costs) and most importantly, why we are willing to forgo them. For any meaningful discourse and constructive policy review to take place, proposers of policy change cannot merely focus on the benefits. They need to consider the consequences arising from the changes they seek and why they are willing to incur them. FOUR CONSTRAINTS In my observations of education policy discourse, it seems the following consequences are often raised in response to new ideas. In other words, the consequences act as fundamental “constraints” on the system, against which any new suggestions should not erode. Think of them as reflecting key pillars of the solid foundation of our system. In general, every new suggestion should not: These constraints are present in most education issues. Just look at the suggestion to abolish PSLE. In his speech last week, Mr Ong remarked that many parents support the PSLE system “because the PSLE experience teaches their children to work hard, and to demonstrate what they have learned throughout their primary school years”.  This argument implicitly invokes the second constraint, since students may be less prepared for the future if a key learning checkpoint is removed and they do not work as hard. Earlier this year, during the Ministry of Education’s Committee of Supply debate, then- Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng remarked that “removing the PSLE and having a through train will only transfer the stress on parents and students elsewhere, such as at the P1 registration”.  He also emphasised that “it will make the O-Level and N-Level exams most stressful – a single exam in the whole career of a child’s life.”  This argument invokes the third constraint, since it implies that there will be more stress overall without the PSLE. If those who want to abolish PSLE still wish to push for it, they must be able to explain why the benefits of doing so outweighs the cost of eroding a key system constraint i.e. why a system which may less actively prepare students for the future or one with more sources of stress is justified. If they now feel the true cost of their proposal is too high a price to pay, then they should consider more suitable, alternative proposals. This is what quality policy discourse should look like – one based on well-thought through ideas, the consideration of trade-offs and a judgment call on what one is willing to forgo. READ: A commentary on a parent's struggle in picking a \"good school\" for their child. READ: With less focus on grades, is PSLE still a necessary checkpoint? A commmentary. IS THAT ENOUGH? A conversation centred on trade-offs can advance our education policy discourse. It can be propelled forward even further if we look deeper into why different people prefer certain trade-offs over others. Before diving into policy discourse, consider this: If policies are means to ends, then disagreements over education policies (means) can reflect disagreements over the aims of education (ends). In education, there can only be one primary aim. Secondary aims must take on a lower priority. Trade-offs must again be made. Thus, before detailed policy discussions, we should all ask ourselves: What is the primary aim of education? To equip the next generation with skills for the future economy? To reduce inequality? To cultivate values and unity? Our answers will show us why we are willing to make the trade-offs we make. If there are vastly differing opinions within the population on the aims of education, then we may also need to have a more fundamental debate on what the primary aim of education in Singapore should be, to get everyone on the same page. Otherwise, our discourse will also still remain hampered. A BETTER DISCOURSE?  Last week, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in Parliament that the 4G leaders will hold a series of discussions to engage Singaporeans on their views. I expect education to feature heavily in these discussions. The success of these discussions can be maximised if all participants are aware of the trade-offs they are willing to make and are explicit about what they feel the primary aim of education is and why other aims are of a lower priority. In other words, understanding that the education system is not a free lunch.

The 40-year-old estate - now emptied of residents - once attracted Instagrammers from far and wide. But shutterbugs and architecture buffs still have plenty of other fun HDB haunts to take in - some Tudor-inspired, some with Mondrian-style accents and others with more than a splash of pop art front and centre.  Over 80 per cent of Singapore's resident population lives in public housing apartments and these distinctive blocks not only stand out among soulless prefab HDB neighbourhoods, they also confer bragging rights on residents. The design of Waterway Terraces I and II at Punggol is characterised by its homage to the cascading terraced rice fields of Asia. The undulating ridges of each level not only provide shade from the elements, they also give the illusion of spaces flowing into each other. Arranged hexagonally, the linked blocks have endless corridors that eventually step down to the waterfront view. Fun fact: In 2016, photos and an article claiming there was a \"roof collapse\" at the Waterway Terraces went viral on social media. It appeared that the author of the article mistook the angled structures atop the buildings as evidence of damage. The Housing and Development Board quickly clarified it was an online hoax but police and the Singapore were spotted on site investigating the claim. The sloping architecture of several blocks at Potong Pasir Avenue 2 is a trademark feature of the 29-year-old town. The slanted roofs - visible from nearby expressways - were part of a move by HDB in the early days of its town planning to give neighbourhoods a distinct look. Many think Block 259 at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2 is a funky private apartment block, but it was actually an architectural experiment by HDB in 1981. Housing authorities had planned to build unique blocks in seven estates to foster a sense of identity and this was one of them.Made out of four combined rotundas, it is Singapore’s only block of circular flats. The round design of the flats meant the bedrooms faced either north or south, while the living rooms and kitchens faced east or west, allowing the flats to stay cool throughout the day. The housing block has since been renamed The Clover @ Kebun Bahru. The Pinnacle@Duxton is no stranger to success, given its status as a multi-award winning public housing marvel. Birthed from an effort to completely utilise an oddly shaped plot of land at Cantonment Road, the structure became the country’s first 50-storey public housing venture, and holds the accolade of being the first in the world to incorporate two sky bridges to connect seven towers.  The lower skybridge boasts a jogging track, senior citizen fitness corner, outdoor gym, playground, community plaza, RC centre and two view decks on its 500-metre expanse. Call it the primary attraction of Teck Whye Avenue. Blocks there recently ditched their graduated yellow to orange colour scheme and teal accents for a look with more artistic appeal. The new paint job appears to be inspired by the iconic work of artist Piet Mondrian and gives the area more than a pop of colour. No need to wait for sunshine after the rain to see this - a cheery block bordering Hougang Avenue 7 stands out with a massive rainbow adorning its exterior. Block 316 is possibly the only remaining HDB block with all the colours of the rainbow splashed across – given that the Eunos Rainbow blocks at Bedok Reservoir road have since been painted over. Did you know the famous rainbow-coloured blocks of Rochor were initially white when they were first built in 1977, and only painted bold colours in 1994? Although the buildings are on the chopping block for the upcoming North-South Expressway, demolition is a slow process and you can still catch a glimpse of it from a high vantage point at Tekka Centre's HDB flats.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/10-instagram-worthy-hdb-blocks-in-singapore-10251758"}, {"datetime": "27 May 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["Sakae Sushi", "Douglas Foo"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Battling high costs, losing friends and thinking big: On the Record with Douglas Foo, Sakae Holdings", "content": " SINGAPORE: In many ways, it would seem that Douglas Foo, founder and executive chairman of Sakae Holdings is going through tough times. The 49-year-old owner of Sakae Sushi, one of Singapore’s leading conveyor belt sushi chains, had to close more than 10 of his 46 local outlets last year. He was also embroiled in a 6-year legal battle against a former Sakae director who he accused of breaching his fiduciary duties. It all started when his friend, Mr Andy Ong invited him to join his property development investment project. Sakae became a minority shareholder in the joint venture real estate investment firm. As Mr Foo sits before me, he looks every bit the well put-together and distinguished businessman but as he talks about the case, it becomes clear that beneath it all, he is still distressed by it. To listen to the full interview, click here.  After all, Mr Ong was a close friend whom he had known since his National Service days. He tells me he still feels “a lot of pain” when he thinks about what happened. “I kept asking myself: What exactly went wrong? Why would anybody do that? And the final conclusion I have is: He was looking for a lot more even though he was making a good amount. It was just not enough for him.” He is cautious about revealing too many details because while a judgment was passed in his favour last year, it has yet to be enforced and that could take “a long time”.  The legal battle cost about S$10 million and according to Mr Foo, had an impact on Sakae’s operations as staff had to spend time tracing documents to facilitate it. I ask him what he has learnt from the episode. “I have not become cynical because of it. I will not, because of one incident, lock everybody out. Maybe just be more cautious.” However, it wasn’t just this that led to the business’s challenges. IS IT WORTH DOING BUSINESS IN SINGAPORE TODAY? “The high cost structure in Singapore has actually evolved quite rapidly over the last couple of years. If you look at the malls today, retail has been impacted. So what happens when retail gets impacted? They all start to get replaced by F&B. The supply is increasing, but what’s happened to demand in the last few years? It’s been very stable. The market is extremely saturated. We’ve not seen growth as compared to the last decade and it tells you exactly what the macroeconomic conditions are and how the cost structure is going to be challenged.” Clearly, rents are an issue, but when I ask him if he thinks the Government should intervene as some other businessmen have suggested, he says he feels otherwise. “I think these are driven by free market forces - demand and supply. Where do you intervene? How do you intervene? At what stage do you intervene? What is a fair intervention approach? Those are very, very challenging, difficult questions to answer. “High rents might be unfair from the perspective of the retailers. But what about the developers? How do you manage that fairness for them? So the best thing to do is to leave it to market forces. The landlords have to do their part to look at whether the rates are reasonable. If it’s not reasonable, market forces will correct that.” It is natural that he would be able to see it from multiple perspectives considering that one of his strategies is to acquire real estate so that he is not constantly at the mercy of landlords. “The likes of Starbucks and McDonald’s actually have a real estate strategy as well. So we, likewise, try to own about 20 to 30 per cent of the units that we operate.” However, he says he has noticed more and more people going into business, but not having thought it through enough to sustain it, which is partly why the market is saturated today. But there is really no way to control this, he concedes.  “There’s never an ideal situation in business. If you never try, you never know. So I think if you are going to start to tell people not to go into this area because it is challenging, it won’t work because there will still be people who want to try it out. Some succeed. Some don’t. That’s part and parcel of life.” While Sakae Sushi outlets in Singapore are dwindling, they are growing across the rest of Southeast Asia. It has 40 in Malaysia and three in Myanmar. It also has 80 associate restaurants in which it holds stakes in the region. Its brands include Sakae Teppanyaki, Sakae Delivery and Hei Sushi. “We want to be a global brand, so we should focus on markets that are ready for our product.That has always been my dream - to have a global brand from Singapore.” I wonder if he feels it might be a better bet to leave Singapore altogether. He confesses that he has been discussing this possibility with his colleagues more often recently. “But my colleagues are very passionate that we are born here, so we should continue to have a presence here.” He clearly feels differently. “I’ve considered leaving. I think there are many markets in the world that are much more easier to operate in and are much more rewarding. Some are really at the beginning phase of having Japanese food. It’s not so common in the market and so it is very easy. We also have good partners that we have been working with for many years now.” But he is careful not to dictate decisions and for now will stay here “while it makes some business sense”. Also, he notes that Singapore has its advantages in terms of a regulatory framework that is clear and business-friendly compared to many other countries.  I raise the possibility that business could also be waning because the quality of the food they serve may not measure up.  \"We have actually been serving a lot of the top hotels and a lot of other enterprises for many, many years now. If they are able to use it in their own establishments, it tells you where we are in terms of the quality of the food,\" he says decisively.   Some critics have said that the reason Sakae is not doing as well as it used to in Singapore is simply because it has not adapted to changing tastes and preferences. When I put this to him, he says he hasn’t been directly involved in running the outlets, but believes his colleagues have been doing what’s right for the business. THE NEXT BIG THING Indeed, it seems his attentions are elsewhere as he tells me about how Sakae Holdings is diversifying its revenue streams so that he can fulfil his dream of having 30,000 F&B outlets worldwide. It’s a figure modelled on other global F&B brands’ success. I ask him why he is so intent on doing this.  \"It's not about money. I don’t need a lot to live my life. But I want my life to be fulfilling, to know that I can leave this world with a smile and knowing that I’ve tried my best in this endeavour to realise a grand dream of bringing something meaningful to the world - affordable and high quality food.\"  He has also been increasingly focussed on ensuring they use sustainable seafood sources.  \"It's important to use the world's resources responsibly,\" he says.  He claims he sees entrepreneurship as a responsibility, not just to customers, but also to the people who work for him.  \"People should feel that working for you is fulfilling to them in terms of not just their financial needs, but personal growth and achievement.\" Sakae has a 40,000 square-foot facility that provides human capital training and development for staff and a leadership centre as well.   But I remark that considering the recent closures, he is clearly far from achieving his dream of a global F&B brand. He concedes that starting from a very small market base has made it harder.  For now, he is banking on discovering the next big thing in order to be able to finance the expansion of the Sakae brand.  There is Sakae Corporate Advisory which provides strategic investor relations services to fast-growing companies in emerging markets. Sakae Fintech made the news recently with Southeast Asia’s first F&B digital token, Bitecoin, which aims to provide reliable and secure peer-to-peer transactions between consumers and merchants. It has partnered e-payment solutions provider Mobile Credit Payment to take this to the next level. The aim is to have a transparent and secure system of record-keeping across the complex F&B value chain that involves suppliers, logistic providers and retail outlets. “Merchants are also using many digital-service systems. That means having separate equipment to cater to various payment methods. Bitecoin is a unified system that can make all this much more efficient,\" he says enthusiastically.  Businesses and consumers will be able to leverage Bitecoin’s ability to amass consumer data when it is paired with a digital wallet. This can help them create targeted marketing tools and help consumers receive personalised promotions that recognize their loyalty and preferences. “This might have a chance of being the next unicorn and when that happens, we will have a lot of financial resources to actually build on the brick-and-mortar business and food delivery business as well. We believe that still has the potential to grow in the region but restaurant returns are quite fixed, so we are using the digital space to get the financial returns to deploy more mergers and acquisitions to build our dream of having a global brand.” They are also developing Sakae Cybersecurity which is aimed at helping small and medium enterprises go digital safely. When I bring up the losses of recent years, he explains that his shareholders have been reassured by their recent efforts. “Because of all the closures we’ve had to write off quite a few losses. When you close, the leases don’t necessarily end and sometimes you even need to negotiate. So this is just a transition phase. We’ve explained this to our shareholders and they have to be in it for the longer term.” He claims they have a group of “good supporters” among their shareholders in spite of the company’s challenges. A LEARNING JOURNEY But Mr Foo is no stranger to challenges. In fact, his first Sakae Sushi outlet was opened in Raffles Place in 1997, during the Asian financial crisis. “I thought about postponing my plans when the crisis hit, but then I thought when really is a good time. It will never be perfect. You just prepare yourself and flow together with the tide because at the end of the day, you can plan all you want but things could still go wrong.” In the beginning, his plan was to open just six outlets. Today, they have surpassed that number. It didn’t always work out so well. They opened an outlet in New York City in 2008 on the ground floor of the Chrysler Building. But the global financial crisis struck shortly after and they closed it in 2009. It's something he accepts as being part of the journey.  \"You can't win every single time,\" he says. Mr Foo claims that as he was growing up, he never thought of becoming an entrepreneur. He grew up, like many Singaporeans at the time, thinking that he would work for a multinational corporation in Singapore and his family encouraged it as well.  His father, an immigrant from China was a mechanical and electrical consultant and taught him the value of money and discipline. He tells me about an incident when he was 10 years old.  He had a fever and called his father, hoping he would come and pick him up. Instead, his dad reprimanded him for wasting 10 cents making the phone call and told him to make his own way home. His monthly allowance was a modest S$50 a month and to supplement it, he would tutor students on weekends. Before his NS enlistment, when he had a few months to kill, he tried out various jobs. He took turbine readings for engineers at the Seraya Power Plant. Then he would go and do relief teaching. He also worked as a baker. “I was hoping to learn some baking skills. At least I could then keep my stomach filled if I ever needed it. Instead I realised I didn’t love to bake, but I did 'bake some love' there,” he says with a laugh. He had no concrete plans to make a career out of any of those jobs. “I took whatever came along. It was not strategic. It was more like a learning journey.” His initial plan was to study engineering in university. “In schools then, all my friends were training to be engineers, technicians, lawyers, accountants to support the MNCs in Singapore. My dad was an engineer, so naturally I applied to be one too and got a place in a local university. But while I was serving National Service in the air force, I was studying about engineering missile systems, defence and electronics. It was fun but I wondered if it was something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I thought about it and I realised that I liked numbers, so why not do something in business and management instead.” He didn’t qualify to get into a business administration course in a local university so, helped by his parents, he went to Australia attain his degree. To help finance his education, he sold shoes at a local market there. BREAKING HIS PIGGY BANK Upon graduation, he wanted to get a job as an investment banker, but as luck would have it, the sector was not hiring at the time. It was the mid-90s and the economy was starting to suffer. “It was the lead-up to the ’97 crisis. What to do? I grabbed the first job that came along. It was a marketing executive position in a Japanese company. I made a lot of Japanese business contacts and from there I started to manufacture clothing in India to be sold in Japan.\" He “broke his piggy bank” to set up a factory in India. It took about S$100,000. The business did well, but as Chinese manufacturers rose, he started to look for alternative paths. “I was at a big risk of being taken out of the whole equation.  So I went back to the drawing board and looked at what to do next. I thought: Everybody needs food. No matter how digitally-connected and virtual things become, you can’t eat virtual food, right?” That and the unavailability of affordable Japanese cuisine in Singapore at the time, led to the genesis of Sakae Sushi. He studied the conveyor-belt restaurants in Japan and Hong Kong and replicated them here. The key to keeping costs low while ensuring quality food, he says, is the technology. “The conveyor belt concept helped us cut down on manpower costs. We didn’t need so many servers to take the food to customers. So that helped keep prices low for customers.” They also provide hot water taps for customer to make their own tea as well as interactive menus for placing orders. It also has portable conveyor belts for catered dining and use robotics to make sushi. It’s clear that he is a true believer in power of technology and innovation. “We have to use technology to  build efficiencies and savings so that we can continue to bring good quality food at reasonable prices to the masses. I knew that I would have to compromise in the beginning by investing a lot in technology for the long term.” A “STUDENT” WITH AN OPEN MIND Today, he is also President of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation and hopes to harness technology to create efficiencies for businesses in this sector as well. “Singapore is a small market, so if you are just doing this market alone, the large infrastructure really doesn’t make sense. Today, manufacturing is no longer just about building a facility. You need to harness facilities. By 2020 we want to provide manufacturing as a service. So all the facilities with excess capacities will be uploaded into the cloud and any startups, or for that matter anybody who requires manufacturing for specific area, parts, could utilize those facilities. It’s about optimizing the world’s resources.” The keys to doing well in the business world today are “thinking big” and “keeping a very, very open mind”. He believes the Government's assistance schemes for businesses are adequate, but “if your mind is not even open, whatever that is being done is going to seem insufficient”. Ultimately, he considers himself a “student”. It’s a mindset that has helped him take risks and overcome challenges to find success. “Life is finite. I feel very blessed to be born in this country. After having seen a lot of people around the world, I realise that I could have been, by a stroke of luck, born somewhere else and I wouldn’t have had the opportunities that I have today to do all the things that I’m doing today.

Their instructions were to add five to six years to this number when asked by customers, but even with the truth accidentally revealed, none batted an eyelid at the prospect of having sex with a teenager. “They all like young girls,” said Honey. “Sometimes, they ask if I’m younger - if I can be younger.” Her tale is emblematic of an island-wide issue on Indonesia’s Batam, according to authorities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) who spoke to Channel NewsAsia. In 2017, Yayasan Embun Pelangi (YEP), a humanitarian agency assisting underage victims of sexual exploitation, handled 28 such instances, of which 14 involved prostitution. Separately, the Rumah Faye agency, which aims to tackle underage sexual abuse, received 21 children last year, of which five were forced into prostitution and the rest sexually exploited. These reported cases aside, there is no recent, reliable measure of the total number of underage individuals being sexually exploited, though in 2016 the Commission for the Protection of Indonesian Children said there were 1,000 child sex workers in Batam. A year later, the End Child Prostitution and Trafficking (ECPAT) global network commented that the number of underage prostitution cases on the little holiday island “continues to grow”, with victims serving up to eight customers in a night. Drefani, the chief of Batam city police’s women and child protection unit, still recalls the youngest victim rescued by her team last year: A four-year-old girl trafficked and sexually exploited.   Was she prostituted, too? The question was asked with some hesitance, but Drefani’s response instantaneous. “Just not yet,” she said with a straight face. “CLOSE ONE, THREE POP UP” Sex work, in general, remains illegal in Indonesia, where there is no official age of consent but men can marry at 19 and women, 16.  Rumah Faye estimates there are some 300 brothels littered throughout Batam, with most masquerading as karaokes or massage parlours. These are technically allowed to operate as business or entertainment outlets, but will be served a letter of notice should any “illegal activity” be detected by police. Any more than three letters and the outlet must shut down, Drefani explained. YEP’s Irwan Setiawan, however, said these brothels simply reopen elsewhere under different monikers. “Close down one, three more will pop up,” added Husaini Tarmizi of the Yayasan Mitra Kesehatan dan Kemanusiaan (YMKK) agency. “At first the police will conduct checks, but once they start taking money from the brothel every month, the checks stop.” Youngsters rescued from these brothels are typically rehabilitated at a shelter first - for no more than two weeks, as mandated by the Indonesian government - before being sent home. For at least six months after, organisations like Rumah Faye will attempt to keep monitoring their progress via phone calls. “Their situation makes them not trust other people, so it takes a while,” said Rumah Faye’s Dewi Astuti, recalling how her toughest nut to crack was a 13-year-old girl, whose pimp had also made her addicted to drugs to tighten his grip on her. The government-funded YEP has also attempted to reach out and educate rural communities where most of these children are trafficked from. But all the NGOs acknowledged their work has already been largely undermined by the current trend of online prostitution. “You won’t find child sex workers at brothels anymore. They’re sent straight to hotels, and it’s harder to track down,” said Dewi. Acknowledging that YEP has yet to help any victims of the online trade, Irwan observed: “Hotels in Batam generally close an eye to odd sightings like a grown-up customer bringing a child up to the room, or a lone child being sent to the hotel by pimps. You can do all that and the reception won’t say anything.” “So now, we’re trying to work with hotels, to get them to tell their staff what to do.” Drefani said her team of nine were also working with colleagues in the cyber department, while attempting some policing of their own on popular social media channels like Facebook and WeChat. “There’s a limit to what we can do, beyond prevention and helping victims,” said Irwan. “It’s the demand side that needs to be worked on.” SINGAPOREANS \"GETTING AWAY WITH IT\" Huddled in the Nagoya city centre’s morass of dingy strips and alleyways, a crassly multi-fluorescent shopfront stands open for business deep into the night. It is tagged as a massage destination on Google Maps, but lying in wait inside is a pushy mamasan - called a “mami” in Batam - with her offering of sex workers seated behind a glass panel. Seconds after the mami brags about having “many, many” Singaporean customers, a pair of them, looking to be in their twenties, breeze through the door with a local driver in tow. They high-five the middle-aged mami like regulars, and survey their prospects for the night’s entertainment - but not before making sure to ask for the youngest available girl. “This one,” the mami gestures to an impossibly petite, elfin specimen. “We usually say she’s 18 years old. One point five (million rupiah) for all night.” “Don’t have younger?” one of the Singaporeans asks, as he sizes her up intently. Scenarios like these are the reason why YEP and Rumah Faye have been calling for Singaporean NGOs and even Government bodies to work together on stemming the flow of sex tourists carried to Batam by the short, 40-minute ferry ride. There are also no recent, detailed figures for Singaporeans or tourists seeking underage sex in Batam. Last year, ECPAT reported anecdotally that consumers of trafficked children were locals from Batam as well as foreigners from Malaysia and Singapore. “Many middle-aged Singaporean men, above 40 years old, who are called ‘apek-apek’, visited Batam for sex with children between the ages of 13 and 17 years. They were usually facilitated by brokers who were taxi drivers to access these child prostitutes,” the global organisation stated. “It is hard to eliminate child prostitution in the island due to high demand.” All the NGOs interviewed said most of the child victims they helped in the last few years had named their exploiters or customers as mainly hailing from Singapore, and Honey claimed she had entertained more Singaporean customers compared to any other nationalities. Channel NewsAsia also obtained police and NGO reports of Singaporeans who had recently engaged in various forms of underage sexual exploitation. Mohammad Asri Sapuan was one such case. According to court documents, the 46-year-old sodomised and forced a 12-year-old boy, referred to as 078, to perform oral sex on him several times. Asri also sent the Batam native to the hotel rooms of visiting Singaporean friends, for IDR 300,000 (S$28) each time. He was eventually arrested in late 2017 and in March sentenced to 13 years’ jail and an IDR 100 million (over S$9,000) fine for sexual assault. His victims - 078 and two others - were counselled, sheltered and nursed back to health by YEP. In late 2016, the agency also tended to the alleged victims of another Singaporean man. The 56-year-old ran a centre - now shuttered - which purported to send domestic workers to Singapore, but really served as a front for him to sexually exploit girls in their pre-teens. “If they did something wrong, they would be asked to circle him and show their genitals while dancing,” said Irwan. “Some of them were also told they would be sent to Singapore faster if they let him have sex with them.” The man was arrested but escaped due to what Irwan described as a loophole which sets perpetrators free during a particular stage in the police’s investigative process. He could even have cleared immigration to Singapore if he wanted to, and today his whereabouts remain unknown - though provincial police have since closed the case and sent the victims home. “Actually a lot of Singaporean men do such activities, but they get away with it - because it’s Batam,” claimed Husaini from YMKK. “LURED BY EMPTY PROMISES” Underpinning the demand and supply factors behind underage sex in Batam are the economic reasons for individuals to be trafficked or even willingly head to the island, said the NGOs. As ECPAT wrote in its 2017 report: “Most of the child victims were from outside Batam. They were usually lured with empty promises of jobs as shopkeepers or restaurant waitresses with a salary of IDR 3,500,000 per month, which is regional minimum wage. “Since regional minimum wage in Batam is higher than that of in other areas in Indonesia, traffickers often use this to lure their potential victims.” Dewi also recounted how Rumah Faye’s last batch of pre-teen victims had been encouraged to come to Batam by a 17-year-old former victim herself. The latter, in turn, had been browbeaten by a pimp who threatened to withhold her pay if she did not do as told. “It’s really hard for them to get away,” said Dewi. “They come here by plane ticket, which the pimp pays for. Then they also must pay to stay at the brothel. The pimp will always say they owe him money, and he will charge everything at twice the normal price - while taking a cut of their pay. “If they do something ‘wrong’ like argue with the pimp, their pay will be cut too. End of the day, it’s as good as not getting any money.” In YEP’s most recent case, a 13-year-old sex worker who charged each of her customers IDR 300,000 rupiah had to give 200,000 to her mami each time. Part of the remaining IDR 100,000 was used to pay off a “room fee”, which resulted in the girl taking home less than IDR 50,000 (less than S$5) each time. In Honey's case, she works every night of the week on a three-month contract, and is largely dependent on tips to pay off an IDR 1.5 million (S$142) debt - part of which was slapped on her just for arriving late for her flight to Batam out of Bogor city, where she previously worked. If she cannot settle the debt before her contract runs out, she will not be allowed to go home to Jakarta and her mother and five brothers, who till this day believe she works in a cafe in Batam. “I’m just going through with it to earn money, so I can send it back to my family and support them,” said Honey, who never finished primary school. “If possible, I don’t want to carry on as a sex worker, but since I don’t have the qualifications, this is the best I can do now. “Even if I can get out from this life, and do something else, if that doesn’t work out, will I have to return to sex work? I’m not sure … I just hope I can meet a guy who likes me and takes me away.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/batam-child-sex-prostitutes-exploitation-abuse-singapore-10244372"}, {"datetime": "27 May 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["inequality", "Yishun", "Woodlands", "Bukit Timah", "general household survey"], "author": "Leong Chan-Hoong", "title": "Commentary: Inequality has a geographic dimension - between and within neighbourhoods in Singapore  ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The two weeks of intense discussion on the presidential address in parliament has unanimously pointed to the danger of inequality and hardening social mobility in Singapore.   The city-state has one of the highest income disparity levels among developed economies, though not among other global cities, before taxes and government transfers.  In the long run, this rift will undermine our social fabric and erode public confidence in our institutions. To the credit of our policymakers and social service sectors, they have put in place policies and programmes to tackle the imbalance of opportunities and enhance upward mobility for the disadvantaged.  Provisions of financial assistance in local schools, special housing grants for low-income families, medical subsidies for the vulnerable, and community care funds for the disabled are just some items on a long list of policies aimed at narrowing the gulf.  Inequality can also affect social cohesion among Singaporeans from different backgrounds. Recognising this, the Government has supported the nurturing of shared experiences between communities to promote social bonding and empathy in spite of the socioeconomic plurality.  Collective memories such as the National Day parades, and Chingay celebrations, and shared spaces like community clubs, schools and recreational parks serve to bridge social divides. This is, however, an uphill task. Singaporeans are not immune to the visceral desire to be close to people of the “same kind”, be it based on ethnicity or class. This easily translates into a tendency to reside in locations that resonate with their own socio-economic standing.  Eventually, an enclave neighbourhood is formed, built either on the back of economic status or ethnicity.  GEOGRAPHY IS FATE? Inequality has a geographic dimension – even for a small and densely populated place like Singapore. Ignore geography and we miss important drivers of inequality and lose opportunities to mitigate them. A concentration or segregation of people based on socio-economic standing has a profound impact on the well-being of individuals. There are broadly two categories of geographic inequalities: Disparity between and within neighbourhoods.   DISPARITY ACROSS NEIGHBOURHOODS In the United States, the economic status of a neighbourhood or state has a great impact across a sweeping range of well-being indicators.   Research has found that people who live in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in their childhood tend to have prolonged periods of poor health in adulthood and are associated with a reduced likelihood of graduating from high school. Singapore, unlike the US, is both a country and a global city. The dividends from economic development in cities tend to be more evenly distributed than nations with a larger land mass. Nevertheless, here, the distribution of economic and social outcomes are also skewed in favour of certain neighbourhoods. According to the 2015 Singapore General Household Survey, more than four in ten households (44.4 per cent) in Bukit Timah earn at least S$20,000 a month, the highest income bracket in the statistical classification. This proportion is eight times as many compared to households in Woodlands (5.4 per cent) or Yishun (also 5.4 per cent). What is perhaps more surprising is that one in five households in Bukit Merah live in a rented flat, while this figure is less than one in 25 in Sengkang or Sembawang.    Neighbourhoods also differ in terms of important non-economic indicators, such as the number of vulnerable households. Yishun has two times the proportion of people (4.8 per cent) who are divorced or separated compared to residents in Bukit Panjang (2.42 per cent).    Worryingly, in recent times, there has been a distinct clustering of brand name schools. These include the Rafflesian schools in Bishan, the Anglo-Chinese Schools in Dover Road, and schools of the Hwa Chong family in Bukit Timah.  It is no coincidence that resale prices of houses near elite educational schools are higher than the average. Qualified and deserving students living in less well-off estates may have to travel a longer distance to these schools, and may therefore miss out on the opportunity to attend better institutions. DISPARITY WITHIN NEIGHBOURHOODS Harvard University Professor Robert Putnam found that diversity of demographics such as income, race, or religion are often linked to greater distrust in neighbourhoods.   There is less incentive among people living in the community to interact with one another if they do not share similar physical or social attributes.   Even in a low crime society like Singapore, there are subtle differences in the quality of life across neighbourhoods.   In a study published by the Institute of Policy Studies in December 2017, residential estates with a more diverse range of dwelling types – which include Marine Parade and Bukit Merah - are correlated with more petty crime.   An area with a high index for dwelling type diversity would have a wider mix of high-end private housing, as well as HDB flats of various room sizes including low-end housing. Such neighbourhoods reported more transgressions than places that are either equally rich or poor.  This appears to support Putnam’s findings that the effects of income inequality, if unmitigated, could lead to low social capital and more anti-social behaviour like crime.

THE FUTURE OF NEIGHBOURHOODS How do we mitigate the challenges linked to economic disparities between and within neighbourhoods? Across neighbourhoods, there are policies to ensure that there is a healthy mix of residents from diverse background, like the co-location of rental and the bigger HDB units. There is also considerable attention to provide a wide range of quality amenities in various corners of the island.    We should explore and pioneer new initiatives in this area. First, popular institutions such as good schools could be made geographically dispersed to enable bright students from relatively vulnerable neighbourhoods to have convenient access to these institutions. Second, we need to do more to identify and provide more “class-less” touch points that can foster shared experiences. Hawker centres and recreational parks are some examples of these places. These locations provide a service that is desired by both the wealthy and needy, is non-exclusive, and all patrons or visitors are treated alike. Within neighbourhoods, the permeability of social classes needs be enhanced. Creating opportunities for interaction alone is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to nurture understanding and empathy between the social classes. Putnam has found that having diverse people residing in the vicinity do not necessarily lead to more meaningful contact or shared experiences. Contact must be meaningful, not superficial, and contrived. More research is needed to identify the type of facilities and the conditions of use that residents feel comfortable interacting with others from a different background.    For instance, residents from both lower and upper class households can be brought together to tackle common problems that affect everyone living in the same neighbourhood, such as preventing mosquito infestation, traffic congestion, or errant use of personal mobility devices.   Not every neighbourhood will be the same, but every neighbourhood can be a good neighbourhood by forging a shared eco-system that bring people together regardless of race, religion or class.

Addressing the need to reduce the national debt and liabilities - which the government puts at around RM1trillion or 80 per cent of its GDP - Mahathir said \"at one go we can reduce it by RM200 billion by doing away with all these huge projects\". The HSR project, valued by analysts at about US$17 billion, is currently out for tender and is scheduled to be completed by 2026. \"The terms of the agreement (for the HSR) are such that if we decide to drop the project, it will cost us a lot of money,\" Mahathir told the financial newspaper The Edge. \"So we are going to find out how we can reduce the amount of money we have to pay for breaking the agreement.\" Mahathir, the 92-year-old who triumphed over scandal-plagued Najib Razak in elections earlier this month, has made it a priority to cut the national debt and pledged to review major projects agreed by the previous government. Work on the RM55 billion East Coast Rail Link - the largest such project in the country and a major part of Beijing's Belt and Road infrastructure push - started last year. The project was planned to stretch 688km connecting the South China Sea at the Thai border in the east with the strategic shipping routes of the Straits of Malacca in the west. \"We are renegotiating the terms,\" Mahathir said. \"The terms are very damaging to our economy.\" The project is being built by China Communications Construction Co Ltd, and is being mainly financed by a loan from China Exim Bank. Mahathir also questioned the need for the project in the first place. \"He (Najib) knew very well that the ECRL, for example, is not something we could afford.

The stalls are part of the TKC Collective, one of several business alliances forged for Ramadan to make the most of the Geylang Serai bazaar as stall rentals hit a record high. \"The tender value had been as low as S$300,000 for the past 10 to 15 years, but this year, it nearly topped S$3 million for the whole bazaar,\" Mr Mohamed Mustaffa Shah, owner of bazaar operator En Niche Events, told BERITAMediacorp.  Food vendors appeared to be hit the most, with stalls located outside the Muslim Converts' Association costing about S$17,000 and those at the new Wisma Geylang priced above S$20,000, excluding utilities.  The eight businesses in the collective - which also include BrewUp, Fed by the Ravens, Island Hydeaway, Katoshka, The MNC Co and Rainbow Works - first met at the recent Prudential Marina Bay Carnival and GastroBeats events before teaming up for the bazaar, where they have their stalls in a row on the mallfront. 21 Sliders' managing director Rajidi Sharnan said they picked Tanjong Katong Complex because it offered some of the cheapest rents - about S$9,000 for a 3 ft by 3 ft stall.  \"After that, it was about promoting the location and pulling in the crowds together, and that was how TKC Collective was formed,\" said Mr Rajidi.  Customers receive a loyalty card that gets them discounts at participating stalls. Each time they purchase from a stall, the card gets a stamp, and a fully stamped card enters them into a draw to win a trip for two. “Collaborating this way builds customer engagement,” said Mr Rajidi. “There are also many business advantages - we share suppliers and influence with one another, and there’s also a lot of cross-promotion.” Across the road at City Plaza, the vendor list reads like a who's who of the local arts and entertainment scene.

But eventually they did and many came back to do it again this year.\" Ms Fatimah said she believes in the pull factor of the space, which also has parking facilities, as well as that of her partner vendors including local personalities like Adlina Anis, Nick Mikhail Razak, Norfasarie Mohd Yahya and Shahril Ishak.  \"People won't want to travel all the way here just to see one shop. And while the vendors are what you would call 'celeb brands', they're not one-hit wonders. They're in it for the long haul,\" said Ms Fatimah, who met many of them over the course of her work. Ms Adlina, who runs a successful eponymous hijab label, sees the value of collaborating with like-minded businesses, having participated in the Geylang bazaar before. To her, it is like rekindling the old kampung spirit of \"gotong-royong\" - on a business level.  \"I've been doing this since 2012 and there was no such thing as a collective then,\" she said. \"I'm glad there's progression. More and more brands are now able to take advantage of the season to test the market and do a bit of brand strategy without forking out too much money.\" Peer support is at the core of Dahlia Mohd’s business as co-founder of En Pointe, a multi-label boutique known for housing regional designers like Alia Bastamam, Nurita Harith, Syomirizwa Gupta. At CelebRaya, En Pointe is also showcasing local independent labels \"who simply cannot afford the time or money for a standalone store throughout the Ramadan weeks\", she said. Among them are Wardrobe, WearMeSG and Yasmeen Cole. \"We've been a successful platform for Malaysian, Indonesian and Bruneian brands so far, so why not do a localised version?\" she added. BRANCHING OUT  Enterprising sisters Shereen and Toni Anwar have a total of seven stalls at the main bazaar food tents. Said Ms Shereen, stalls for WORD. and new brand Suap outside Wisma Geylang set them back more than S$20,000 each - about double of last year's rent. \"It's not that I'm not willing to pay the S$20,000, because the crowd is there. You can make money - it's just a matter of how much,\" she told Channel NewsAsia. \"We usually focus on Geylang, but because the rent is so high this year, we're having to spread ourselves thin. We also have stalls in the Tampines and Woodlands bazaars so we can try and cover the Geylang cost. \"We did well last year, but we knew we couldn't expect the same this year so we had to have a Plan B. Because let's face it - if you don't have snaking queues, S$20,000 is too much. There's also manpower cost and supplies to think about. Food is a lot of money,\" she added. There are at least three major Ramadan bazaars in the heartlands this year, including the Hari Raya Bazaar at Our Tampines Hub and Bazaar Raya Utara in Woodlands.   Independent events are also gaining ground.  Farah Diana Events Management is gearing up for its festive bazaar Jalan-Jalan Makan-Makan, touted as the first of its kind at Marina Bay Sands. Running for three days from Jun 1, it will feature appearances by Malaysian artists like singer Dayang Nurfaizah and TV host Nabil Ahmad.  It's a concept similar to CelebFest, an annual star-studded event organised by Rose Valley, which drew massive crowds at Suntec City earlier this month.  LalooLalang, helmed by Singapore actress and host Huda Ali, will also return for the fourth time this Ramadan. Ms Huda said about 100 vendors are participating in this year's edition - \"slightly more than last year\". The business owners range from 19 to 35 years old and nearly half are returning participants. Stalls start at S$450.  \"As organisers, we make sure their basic welfare is met. We respond as quickly as possible to enquiries and work hard to draw the spending crowd,\" said Ms Huda, who describes the recent influx of festive events as \"healthy\".  \"Halal butterbeer\" brand Boo:Eh will be set up at five Ramadan events this year, including LalooLalang and the bazaar in Tampines.  \"Many businesses such as ours are active at pop-up events because we don't have a brick-and-mortar store. They are also easier to prepare for than the Geylang bazaar because they last only a couple of days,\" said one of its founders, Noraziana Mohamed.  \"These events are also the most exciting ones during the festive period because they are often themed or bring in overseas celebrities. There are always huge crowds because of their novelty,\" she added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/young-entrepreneurs-rally-to-beat-soaring-geylang-bazaar-costs-10260602"}, {"datetime": "26 May 2018 04:29PM", "tags": ["crime", "tax", "cigarettes", "police"], "author": "", "title": "32 foreign workers caught with duty-unpaid cigarettes in Punggol raid", "content": " SINGAPORE: Thirty-two foreign workers were caught for possessing duty-unpaid cigarettes during a raid at a foreign workers' dormitory in Punggol on Tuesday (May 22) night.

In a video that went viral last year, a drunken Australian man, 44-year-old Jason Peter Darragh, was seen taunting two police officers in Changi Airport while they tried to apprehend him.  He was eventually subdued with the help of passers-by, but the video prompted netizens to question how the police were trained and whether they were competent enough to handle weapons like batons. The Singapore Police Force has arrested 49,868 people in the past three years. Figures from the police also showed there were 412 cases of officers suffering physical hurt and verbal abuse in the course of their work last year, compared with 314 cases in 2015. To help the media better understand the challenges the officers faced on the ground, reporters were invited to attend a condensed training course in a rare behind-the-scenes experience. MASTERING THE BASIC TECHNIQUES The day started early on May 16 at the Home Team Academy. After a quick warm up, journalists were paired up and taught commonly used martial arts techniques - such as the rear wrist lock and the arm bar takedown - that can be used to quickly take control of another person.  While the instructors made everything look effortless, my fellow colleagues and I were failing spectacularly – putting pressure on the wrong spots and twisting arms the wrong way. After a few stumbling efforts, we were taught to use handcuffs. Even with another reporter who gamely remained still while I learned how to cuff her, I struggled to operate the cuffs properly.  It proved quite challenging to keep her wrist locked in a way such that she would be immobilised, while holding on to the cuffs in the proper manner. It took several tries before I got the hang of it. We got to put our newly acquired skills to the test when the instructors threw us a challenge. An experienced police officer played the role of a drunk man causing public nuisance in a mock scenario, and our jobs were to arrest him. I was paired up with three other reporters. For 20 long minutes, he slipped through our various attempts to grasp his arms and trip his legs. Even when we eventually got him to the floor, he refused to surrender his arms, stubbornly pinning them to his sides.  Eventually, the instructors had to step in to help before the handcuffs went on. This is a real scenario that officers face on the ground. Mr Raymond Lo, commanding officer of the Frontline Policing Training Centre, shared that non-compliant subjects can demonstrate passive resistance, active resistance and can even be outright violent.  “We do have a few cases where the subject can turn violent all of a sudden or is violent from the very onset ... Police provides very comprehensive training for both our recruits and our in-service officers in the use of force.  \"The use of force ranges from verbal commands to use of tasers and then combat and even firearms.” He added that the situation on the ground is often dynamic, and officers often have to make split-second decisions.  “If you think about it, the aggressor often has the first-mover advantage, because they have to exhibit some level of aggression before officers will react,” added Mr Lo.  USING WEAPONS At the session, reporters were also given the opportunity to shoot tasers loaded with training cartridges. When a fully operational taser is fired correctly, two probes are embedded in the subject’s skin, delivering 50,000 volts of electricity to momentarily stun a target. Instructors taught us to aim such that one probe would land on the subject’s upper abdomen and the second probe will land on the subject’s upper thigh. We were told that the tasers are not usually used on moving targets, as the probes could either miss, or worse, land on sensitive regions of the body such as the face or chest. With many tools at their disposal, officers are taught to use the appropriate amount of force. “The officers will have to consider many factors, the things like the number of officers they have for the particular incident, the crowd size, the profile of the subject - whether they are petite or whether they are big built and also, their age,” said Mr Lo. Mr Lo added that communication skills are also important when officers are dealing with suspects. “We want them to use their soft skills, engage the other party and get their agreement, their commitment to follow instructions,” he said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/shooting-tasers-and-martial-arts-techniques-how-the-police-make-10280390"}, {"datetime": "26 May 2018 03:21PM", "tags": ["Hyflux", "business", "finance"], "author": "Elizabeth Neo", "title": "Hyflux says will meet with investors at ‘right time': SIAS", "content": " SINGAPORE: As the ongoing troubles of Singapore water treatment firm Hyflux continue to worry investors, its chief executive officer, Olivia Lum, has given the assurance that she plans to meet with investors at \"the right time\".

But the group - called the Jane Austen Circle Singapore (JACS) - is no mere book club. The local chapter of the society which has arms in the USA, UK, Italy, Pakistan and Australia, has morphed into an elaborate hobby, complete with costuming and celebrations. Seven years since its inception, the “Janeites” as they call themselves, have a number of gatherings under their belt, where members come adorned in gowns of the 19th century Regency period and hold dances and dramatic readings. Every detail about the bygone era is adhered to, from food to etiquette. Founding members of JACS include Margy Supramaniam, an English teacher, Nicole Kang, a dance instructor, and Chris Kelley, a gemologist. They pour considerable amounts of time and energy into hosting these elaborate Austen events twice a year since it moved to The Arts House in 2014. “We’re all working and too busy to put in the time we’ve put in, but we do it because we love it,” said Ms Supramaniam who is the co-president of JACS. To reproduce the style of Regency period in an inexpensive way, Ms Kang hand-makes what she can, from hanging artwork to table ornaments.  Members of the society also say they aim to keep the group’s setting intimate, despite its growing popularity. The intention is to imitate Jane Austen’s sense and sensibilities, as she often read her novels at home to her family and close friends. “I do everything myself to keep the costs very low. We continue to be a non-profit, because we want to keep the setting intimate and inclusive, just as how Austen would like it to be,” said Ms Kang. She added that the society donates its proceeds from ticket sales to charity organisations, which includes the Mission to Seafarers, VIVA Foundation for Children with Cancer, to name a few. Austen, a daughter of a reverend, was known to have a heart for the poor, Ms Kang said. “I’ve been attending the society’s events for five years, and I keep coming back every year. Everybody kind of knows everyone,” said Ms Guo Shu Hui, a senior executive who attended a recent Regency dance. She grew to love Austen through movie adaptations. Ms Ng Pei Wen and Ms Elaine Mok, both students in local universities, have been members of JACS since taking up Literature in junior college. “We get to experience what we’ve read from Jane Austen in JACS.We get to see the stories unfold before our eyes,” said Ms Ng, who turned up at the dance in a Mr Darcy-style coat. “Stepping into a Jane Austen Circle event is like stepping into another time in history - a fantasy of sorts; a really nice escape from reality,” said Ms Mok.   “We all love escapism. I love escaping into that world of dance and costumes and being someone else for a few hours,” said Ms Supramaniam. She has amassed a treasure trove of Regency costumes. These include dresses and hats from local thrift stores that have been “upcycled” with lace, pleats, ribbons, frills and other embellishments. Even a dead parrot she found by the roadside ended up as decoration for her fancy dress. “This sounds rather morbid but I didn’t want this beautiful green parrot to die in vain, so I used the green feathers on Lady Catherine’s bonnet,” said Ms Supramaniam. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IN SINGAPORE?   Although Jane Austen’s novels were written more than two hundred years ago in England, the fans in Singapore say the themes resonate to this day. “Actually the culture of Jane Austen is part of the culture of Singapore,” said Ms Supramaniam. “Money is very important in Jane Austen’s novels. Everybody wanted to marry Mr Darcy who (was making) £10,000 a year. It is still important who you marry; it’s important how you bear yourself and it’s important how you behave.” Echoing the sentiment, Ms Guo said: “Women here in Singapore face a lot of societal pressure to marry men of equal education, preferably earning a higher salary. A lot of parents still prefer their daughters to ‘marry up’. It hasn’t changed much since Austen’s society.” Ms Kang pointed to the comic exaggerations in the novel that could be seen as criticism of social class and standing. “We want people to note that Austen’s works are not elitist nor exclusive,” she said. “What she writes about is very relevant. While Austen’s characters may still seem like caricatures, these people do exist in real life as well. The idea is not removed from (us),” she said. She added that JACS will continue to help people have a grand old time while bringing Austen’s works and world to a wider audience. Quoting Jane Austen, Ms Kang said: “My idea of good company... is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation. That is what I call good company.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-plain-jane-singapore-club-that-s-all-about-austen-10278592"}, {"datetime": "26 May 2018 12:59PM", "tags": ["food"], "author": "", "title": "Toast Box outlet at Plaza Singapura suspended over rat, cockroach infestations", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Toast Box outlet at Plaza Singapura has been suspended for two weeks over rodent and cockroach infestations.

It was also fined S$800. The suspension is from May 25 to Jun 7. The unit is occupied by adjoining BreadTalk and Toast Box outlets, both of which are under the BreadTalk Group. When Channel NewsAsia called the shops, a BreadTalk employee confirmed that Toast Box was closed for two weeks. The BreadTalk outlet is still open, he said. When contacted, Toast Box said it has taken action to deal with the infestations. \"We fully acknowledge the results of the NEA assessment which reflected that there were improvements needed in the cleanliness and hygiene standards at our outlet, and we took immediate action to address the findings,\" Toast Box regional general manager Vincent Lim said. \"Immediately after the assessment, we administered thorough pest control and sanitisation of the entire outlet.\" It also took the \"proactive approach\" to close the outlet for renovation before the NEA-enforced closure, Mr Lim said. \"During this closure, we will further reinforce our standard operating procedures and training with our staff,\" he added. CapitaLand, which manages Plaza Singapura, said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia that it is aware of the incident.

Last week, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung again outlined moves such as changing the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system. From 2021, the PSLE T-score system will be replaced with wider “achievement levels” - a change which he called a \"big step\" in reducing academic stress and helping students enjoy learning more. Some question if these aims will be achieved, citing the possibility of parents and students still feeling the pressure to achieve every last point in order to attain higher achievement levels. Let’s face it, the system will ultimately be what the people in it make of it. Of course there are others who feel that bolder changes need to be made to the extent that standardised exams such as the PSLE should be scrapped altogether. But speaking more broadly about the education system, Mr Ong also said that while the Government needs to listen to the voices of all segments of society, there is no a singular message from the people. READ: A commentary from a mother of three on combating the culture of comparison with the release of PSLE results. READ: The struggle parents face in picking a “good school” for their child, a commentary. Instead, there is a \"a diversity of views, conflicting and complex, even as they remain compelling\". For example, he said a call for the PSLE to be scrapped ignores parents who in fact support the system. \"Because the PSLE experience teaches their children to work hard, and to demonstrate what they have learned throughout primary school years,\" Mr Ong explained.  Many parents are also not overly stressed by it, because they don’t see PSLE as an exercise to chase for high marks, but rather as an objective and transparent way to decide which secondary schools their children will go to. READ: A commentary on retaining the PSLE. THE BELL CURVE MATTERS? Based on my conversations with parents, Mr Ong is not wrong. In fact, some have even told me that they prefer the current PSLE T-score system.  Some proclaim that such a system which measures children’s’ abilities relative to their peers is vital training for the real world.  One pointed out that even at work, many of us are assessed on a bell curve, so why shouldn’t children be exposed to competing on this scale from young.  Advocates of this approach say it instils a competitive spirit that motivates their children to excel and outdo their peers. Perhaps they have a point. If exams are done away with, would students be at risk of losing out on developing discipline, drive and a sense of competitiveness that they would ultimately need to succeed even in the working world? Singapore as a nation, strives for excellence in international league tables on several fronts and when, for example, our airport receives a top award for being the best in the world, we collectively rejoice. Having such measures of excellence can have a motivating effect and helps ignite a competitive spirit that is essential to our survival. DOES FIXATING ON THE COMPETITION HURT OR HELP? However, proponents of scrapping the PSLE often cite the young age of the children subjected to the high-stakes exam and the judgement that comes along with it as justifications to eliminate it. Should students so young be made to deal with the overwhelming stress of having to ace such standardised tests? Do students inadvertently end up spending more time preparing for the exam rather than developing a love for learning? If the measure of person’s capabilities is assessed on his or her ability to ace exams, what does this do to those who aren’t good at exams? Are exams even the best way to determine a person’s strengths and capabilities as a human being? Do we, as a society, really want to continue supporting moves that label and effectively write off children at such a young age without nurturing their other strengths and capabilities? These are all valid questions. If the goal is to motivate individuals to work hard and do their best, whether in exams or in their chosen sport or profession as an adult, perhaps a distinction needs to be made between unhealthy competitiveness and motivation. We shouldn’t assume that competitiveness leads to motivation when clearly, it can often create negative stress and peer pressure that could in fact, dampen motivation. In fact, several studies show that if competition in schools is inappropriately exercised, it even causes anxiety among those who excel in spite of it. American author Alfie Kohn who has written numerous books on education and testing has been warning against excessive competition since the 1980s. In The Case Against Competition, he claims that competition in fact undermines self-esteem and motivation and children do not learn better when “education is transformed into a competitive struggle”. He cites research showing that competition makes kids anxious and interferes with concentration, and that those who lose will naturally suffer self-doubt. But even winning may not build character as feelings of self-worth become “dependent on external sources of evaluation as a result of competition”, and a child’s value in such situations is usually defined by the number of people they’ve beaten. Those of us who believe that without competition, we will become ill-disciplined and unsuccessful perhaps should think twice. According to Kohn and some other researchers there is evidence that productivity in the workplace and even in the classroom suffers as a result of competition. Kohn cites studies by David Johnson, a professor of social psychology at the University of Minnesota, and his colleagues who reviewed work on this subject from 1924 to 1980. The majority of the studies found that kids in fact learn better when they work cooperatively as opposed to competitively. Competition, in fact, prevents kids from sharing their talents and resources. Trying to beat others distracts them as it forces them to concentrate on the reward and become less interested in the learning. Kohn claims that “there’s no problem with comparing their achievements to an objective standard (how fast they ran, how many questions they got right) or to how they did yesterday or last year. But if we value our children’s intellectual development, we need to realise that turning learning into a race simply doesn’t work”. Granted, Kohn’s views are considered controversial and I’m sure if one looked, there will be other studies that counter his views. Perhaps the best way to gauge the impact of competition is by observing your child. Is he or she thriving or declining in a competitive academic environment? READ: Are we missing the point of education? A commentary. READ: The education system is changing but is true change still elusive? A commentary. OTHER METHODS OF MOTIVATING EXCELLENCE A common thread in research about motivation is that competition doesn’t have to be the sole method of motivating someone to do his best. Psychologists say encouraging your children to do their best, having fun and learning a skill can be a powerful motivator. Certainly exams aren’t the only way to do this. Perhaps instead of advocating that our children be subjected to rigorous standardised testing or bell curve assessments that some of us are subjected to in the working world, we should advocate for change away from such assessments in work settings as well. In my recent On the Record interview with Chairman of Changi Airport Group, Liew Mun Leong, he revealed that his approach to making Changi Airport the best airport in the world was built on, in fact, not focussing on the competition. “I told my staff that being the best airport in the world is not to be your target. Don’t use that as a goal and your KPI. Don’t chase the top airport award because if you do that, it will distract you.” Your target is to build an air hub, your target is to make your passengers happy. Being the best is just the result of your efforts and your motivations. If you make beating others your target, then you will be too obsessed with it and then you may forget other things. In this case, it seems success was a by-product of doing your best to be the best than you can be, rather comparing yourself to others and trying to outdo them. Can’t this approach be applied to the way we view education and how our children’s strengths and weaknesses are evaluated? There are already some promising changes occurring in the education system. Among them, a greater focus on applied learning, multiple pathways to help kids discover their passions, strengths and competencies, and a programme rather than class-based approach that ensures more porosity between classes and streams. Some educators have suggested a greater focus on multiple evaluation methods which include a students’ participation in class discussions and projects. Whether PSLE will eventually be done away with is clearly a discussion that will continue. But one thing that can be done almost immediately is modifying the mindsets about academic competition both within the classroom and at home. The key is to ensure that kids are not judged mostly on their ability to ace exams and that those who excel in this regard are not automatically judged as being superior to those who don’t. It is also important for us to realise there are other ways to encourage individuals to discover their strengths and excel while building character. Unhealthy, debilitating academic competition is not the only way. Our education system has to reward more than just examination prowess and more importantly, we, as individuals, need to learn to do the same or risk losing valuable human talent.

He then pressed against the eyeball until globs of pink and white appeared from the slit. And in quick, deft strokes, he confidently trimmed off the fatty tissue. The globe of the eye was then realigned and the same procedure was done to the other eye. In a short span of 20 minutes, he had given the unconscious longyu or Dragon Fish (what the Chinese call arowana) an eye lift and three other cosmetic procedures – enlarging its fin and tail with a syringe needle, as well as removing its blemished scales with a pair of forceps. All this done inside a plastic blue tub along an HDB corridor. “It’s not hard to learn to do an operation on the fish. And we get to gain more knowledge to bring happiness to the hobbyists,” said the 35-year-old owner of Paradise Arowana in Lim Chu Kang. Mr Lim is among a handful of ornamental fish traders here who perform cosmetic and medical procedures on fish, usually on the more expensive Asian arowana and Japanese koi. Such practices are commonly known to fish hobbyists, but remain relatively unheard of outside the circle. These beauty measures have raised a few ethical and legal concerns, with some believing that the job should be left to licensed professionals such as vets. Indeed some koi breeders CNA Insider spoke to admitted to providing such services, but declined to elaborate, partly out of concern over reactions. 'LIKE CARRYING A NEWBORN' Hobbyist Desmond Yee, whose S$1,000 super red arowana was just operated on by Mr Lim, was visibly excited by the prospect of having the “perfect” fish. The procedures, he said, were necessary as his arowana “still got a few parts to touch up”. His chief concern was that his arowana might overdose on the anaesthesia and not wake up, something he said had happened to other hobbyists. “I was a little worried but I trust him,” he added, beaming after the anaesthesia had worn off and the groggy fish was back to its usual self. I can see a lot of difference, now there’s no more popping up of the eye. It’s like carrying a newborn baby. It was when more fish hobbyists like Mr Yee started to request for cosmetic procedures, that Mr Lim decided to head to Indonesia to learn from an arowana expert four years ago. “In the old days, the older people just wanted to rear the fish to be nice,” he said. “Now people are on a different level - they want their fish to be perfect and defects-free.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The training in Indonesia took about two hours and when Mr Lim returned, he started performing such procedures for his clients, often making house calls. In the past four years, he has had no fewer than 200 “fish patients”. “This is a job that brings joy to the hobbyists. We feel happy when we see the fish look nicer and healthier when they recover,” said Mr Lim, who typically charges about S$120 for a house visit. WATCH: An arowana getting 'beautified' (4:32)  'BETTER THAN A DOCTOR'? Problems commonly associated with arowanas include the ‘drop eye syndrome’ where one or both of its eyeballs are continuously tilting downwards. There are a few suspected causes for this: High-fat diet given to the fish, genetics, or environmental factors. In the tank, uneaten food often sinks to the bottom and over time, the arowana might develop a habit of constantly looking down. While Mr Lim performs these procedures once or twice a week, arowana trader Eugene Ng said he sometimes handles a few cases a week. In the local arowana circles, Mr Ng is better known as Dr Ark, after a pet store that he runs. A banner over his shopfront states 'Fish Clinic’. Mr Ng claims to have pioneered the practice in Singapore 18 years ago, when he was asked to help beautify an arowana for a competition. He picked up his skills by reading up on such procedures, practising on fish and exchanging pointers with other arowana traders. “I’m not a doctor but people named me Dr Ark because they think I do better than a doctor,” he quipped. He also thinks that giving the fish a better appearance is “a good deed”. “The owner will be more affectionate to them,” he said.  Like any lady who does plastic surgery, it’s to gain more love from their loved ones. Other than cosmetic procedures, hobbyists also turn to Mr Ng for medical procedures when their fish develop swim bladder problems or when they are injured. Arowanas affected by the former are unable to maintain buoyancy and tend to float nose down, tail up, upside down - or they sink. “My main concern is to rescue and save the fish,” said Mr Ng. “In fact, I don’t charge a single cent if I can’t save the fish.” DO FISH FEEL PAIN? However, without the necessary skills and knowledge to assess the condition of these fish, these traders are at risk of causing them more harm, said Dr Frederic Chua of Allpets and Aqualife Clinic. For example, while Mr Lim and Mr Ng say that they use anaesthesia to immobilise the fish, Dr Chua said that it is unknown if the solution they use has an analgesic effect, which is to prevent pain. “How do they know that when the fish is knocked out, they do not feel pain?” asked Dr Chua. Both Mr Lim and Mr Ng cite online literature that suggests that fish do not feel pain. “To a lot of them (people) this is cruelty to the fish. But I hope to explain that fish brains are so small that they don’t react to pain,” explained Mr Ng. \"During the operation we use medication to put the fish to sleep.” However, Dr Chua holds the view that fish do respond to pain. “Fish have pain receptors on their skin and certain parts of their body. And there are nerves that send these pain messages to the brain. But these network of nerves are not as complicated or complex as you find in warm-blooded animals,\" he said. We have the impression that fish don’t perceive pain the way warm-blooded animals do, but we cannot say fish suffer no pain at all. “If they feel pain, they will respond by struggling, trying to swim away. Sometimes they quiver or tremble,\" he added. THE QUESTION OF ETHICS Dr Zeehan Jaafar, a lecturer with the biological science department at the National University of Singapore, said that scientific literature corroborates the theory that fish do feel pain. She believes the procedures undertaken by these fish traders have not undergone scientific scrutiny in terms of efficacy and impact to the fish. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “Individuals performing these surgeries may be experts by trade, but they are not held to standards that one might expect from professional veterinarians,” she said, adding that the possible risks include infection, scarring and possibly death. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), when contacted, said that having experience with animals does not necessarily mean one has adequate medical knowledge to carry out work of a veterinary nature. “Cosmetic surgery ... is unnecessary and is a form of animal exploitation,” said its executive director Jaipal Singh Gill. “Surgery for medical purposes, for example to treat diseases, should be carried out by a licensed veterinarian.” He cited section 53(1) of the Animals and Birds Act where it is an offence to “treat, vaccinate, or inoculate any animal or bird” unless one is licensed to do so. Fish fall under the definition of animals in the Act. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In Dr Chua’s view, “if one were to do an invasive procedure for the sake of just beautifying the animal without improving its quality of life, then it becomes an ethical issue.” He himself has performed fewer than 10 cosmetic procedures on fish since 1995, mostly on koi and luohan (flowerhorn fish), and one arowana with fin overgrowth. He turned down some requests because of possible \"post-operative complications that would result in unnecessary distress and suffering for the fish”. “Ethically, if one regards fish as living animals which potentially suffer pain and distress, then... we shouldn’t be letting inexperienced hands handle such situations,” he said. 'WE ARE HELPING THE FISH' But to Mr Ng, people like him are helping the fish and their owners. “When the pet fish develops a defect, the owner will tend to neglect the fish and maybe not like the fish that much,” he said.  \"So I’m just doing a good deed by correcting the appearance, to make it look nicer, so it gains more affection from the owner.\" WATCH: Eugene Ng on why it's good for the fish (1:00)  The Agri-food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore, when contacted, said that it has received one piece of feedback on cosmetic procedures on fish, and that it is investigating. “We will not hesitate to take enforcement action if there is any animal welfare issue,” said the agency. Under section 42(1)(d) Animals and Birds Act, anyone found guilty of wantonly or unreasonably causing any unnecessary pain or suffering to any animal can be fined up to S$15,000 and/or jailed for up to 18 months. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dr Chua acknowledged that even with regulations in place, enforcement would be difficult.  \"Maybe we should start by educating people about the necessity of doing these procedures,\" he said. “There’s no point regulating something when you don’t have the ability to police. “(But) when we educate people on the merits or the disadvantages of doing certain things, then the demand for unnecessary cosmetic procedures would not be there anymore.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/pet-fish-fins-cosmetic-procedures-10278656"}, {"datetime": "26 May 2018 06:00AM", "tags": [], "author": "Lee Li Ying", "title": "EU-Singapore FTA on track to come into force by 2019: Iswaran", "content": " SINGAPORE: The European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) is on track to come into force by 2019, said Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S Iswaran in a wrap-up interview with reporters in Paris, France, on Thursday (May 24). The minister was in the city on a four-day visit to deepen innovation and research ties as part of the France-Singapore Year of Innovation 2018. The EU is Singapore’s biggest investor and third largest trading partner. In 2017, bilateral trade grew to US$98.4 billion, making up slightly more than 10 per cent of Singapore’s total trade. Conversely, Singapore is EU’s largest trading partner in the ASEAN region. Negotiations for the agreement were concluded in October 2014, and Mr Iswaran said progress is underway in the EU to ratify it, and there is a desire to see it concluded early. “Just this week, the Council of Ministers met and they’ve put out a record of the meeting which shows that the Council has agreed that the work on EUSFTA should be intensified in order for it to be ratified by 2019,” said Mr Iswaran. “Beyond the economic argument, the broader strategic point is we think the EUSFTA is important because by ratifying it, it's another signal to the world that like-minded countries are building closer economic ties, especially in the backdrop of the anti-globalisation rhetoric that we hear,” he added. BUILDING STRONGER INNOVATION LINKS WITH FRANCE During his trip, Mr Iswaran also attended innovation conference Viva Technology, where he met French President Emmanuel Macron and reaffirmed bilateral ties. The minister said there is significant scope for cooperation between both countries. “France is eager for its innovation and start-up ecosystem to be connected with the world. In particular, they have high regard for Singapore's innovation and startup ecosystem,” said Mr Iswaran.  “In fact, President Macron mentioned this in his keynote address this morning - Singapore being one of the places in the world where there is a thriving innovation ecosystem which France is keen to work with.” Singapore and France have a rich history of R&D cooperation in various fields like biomedical sciences, aerospace and consumer care business.  For example, Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) has research collaborations with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)and several French universities in the areas of smart cities and digital health.  Companies like L’Oreal, Servier and Airbus have also forged multiple industry collaborations with several A*STAR research institutes. At the Vivatech event, Mr Iswaran also took part in a dialogue with his counterpart, French Minister for Higher Education, Research and Innovation Frederique Vidal, where they encouraged businesses to leverage support infrastructures in both countries to expand into Asia and Europe. Mr Iswaran also delivered a keynote address at a session to promote Singapore’s role as a deep tech hub in Asia. 4G LEADERSHIP In the wrap-up interview, Mr Iswaran also responded to questions about the direction of Singapore’s fourth-generation leadership, following the Cabinet reshuffle just last month and given recent developments in the region. Citing initiatives like the Future Economy Council and SkillsFuture, Mr Iswaran said there’s a need to do more cross-ministry work as issues that Singapore faces become more complex. “We are in a more complex environment, where it is not easy to categorise particular issues to particular ministers. Those days are fast disappearing … I think this is where there are opportunities for more interactions and joint assessments. I think relying on each other's judgment to form a holistic assessment is going to be part of evolution,” said Mr Iswaran.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/eu-singapore-fta-on-track-to-come-into-force-by-2019-iswaran-10279848"}, {"datetime": "26 May 2018 12:05AM", "tags": ["Traffic accidents"], "author": "Kamini Devadass", "title": "Body of 6-year-old boy who died in Choa Chu Kang bus accident sent home to India", "content": " SINGAPORE: The body of the six-year-old boy who died in a bus accident at Choa Chu Kang was repatriated back to India on Friday (May 25).  According to an undertaker from Hindu Casket Services, the boy's body was scheduled to be taken home on an evening flight, while his parents had returned to India earlier in the afternoon. At about 12.30pm on Friday, family and friends of the boy, known as Ashwin, arrived at the Health Sciences Authority mortuary to identify and collect the body.  They declined to speak to the media, saying the family had asked for privacy.

Wee Teong Boo, 67, is accused of raping his female patient, then aged 23, in a late night consultation on Dec 30, 2015, at his clinic in Bedok. The doctor is married with five children.  Wee has maintained in his defence that he performed a pelvic examination on the patient to rule out the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease, after she complained of frequent urination and genital itch. This examination involved him inserting his fingers into her vagina. When Wee took the stand in his defence on May 10, he said this was communicated to the victim, and that she had given her consent. He also admitted then that he did not use gloves or lubricant during the examination, as he had been “caught off-guard” by the patient’s sudden complaint of the itch in her genitals. As prosecutors continued their cross-examination of Wee on the 11th day of the trial on Friday, it emerged that in two police statements Wee had given while he was in police custody immediately after his arrest, he had admitted to using his saliva as a lubricant during the pelvic examination. When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz why he had done so, Wee responded that “saliva is antibacterial”, and that he knew this as part of the “general knowledge” that he had. “Normally, I would not do this at all,” Wee added. “But on that day ... I cannot explain it.” When the DPP asked Wee why the evidence he gave in court differed from that in the police statements, Wee responded that he could not recall what he had said then. Questioned further on this point by defence counsel Edmond Pereira during re-examination, Wee said that he had “actually forgotten much of the contents of the (police) statements.” Mr Pereira then asked Wee to clarify what he had said earlier about saliva being antibacterial. Wee replied that saliva has “some antibacterial elements”. “But that is no excuse for using it as a lubricant,” Wee added. “GLARING INCONSISTENCIES” IN DOCTOR’S POLICE STATEMENTS, EVIDENCE IN COURT The prosecution on Friday attacked Wee's defence as an \"elaborate concoction\", as they took the court through the police statements he had made following the alleged incident. While Wee had signed every page of both statements, he had stressed that some parts were “not 100 per cent accurate”, and suggested that ASP Carol Ong, the police officer who recorded Wee’s second statement, had “planted” parts of the statement. After repeated questioning from Justice Chua Lee Ming, Wee admitted that he had given the statements voluntarily. Another discrepancy highlighted by prosecutors was Wee’s testimony in court that he had suffered from erectile dysfunction and low libido. However, in one of the police statements, Wee had indicated clearly that he did not have any erectile dysfunction. When the DPP asked Wee about this, Wee responded that the erectile dysfunction “did not cross his mind” at the time he had given the statement, as it “did not bother him” then.  He added that he had consulted a urologist to get a report on his condition three days after he was released from police custody. The urologist’s report was later admitted as evidence in court. In summing up the prosecution’s case, DPP Sripathy-Shanaz contended that Wee’s claim of erectile dysfunction was an “afterthought”, and described his version of events as an “elaborate concoction”. She pointed out that Wee had testified that he was able to have sex with his wife in 2015, and he had only engaged a urologist to “get a way out”. She also cited the “glaring inconsistencies” between Wee’s testimony in court and the police statements he had signed, noting that there was also no mention of pelvic inflammatory disease in either of the police statements, or in Wee’s notes on the patient. “I put it to you that your entire claim that you performed a vaginal examination to exclude pelvic inflammatory disease is an utter lie,” she said, adding that Wee had “concocted (an) elaborate story” on using saliva as lubricant during the examination in case his DNA had been found in the alleged victim’s private parts. “You had no qualms about raping her because she did not have an infected vagina,” she said. Wee disagreed. The trial continues on Jul 10, with the defence expected to call nine more witnesses, including Wee’s wife and his clinic’s nurses.  ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/doctor-on-trial-for-raping-patient-concocted-elaborate-story-in-10278524"}, {"datetime": "25 May 2018 08:16PM", "tags": ["JTC", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "", "title": "Hope for JTC to continue ‘tradition of high standards and bold ambitions’: PM Lee", "content": " SINGAPORE: Having been the “frontrunner and pathfinder” that grew in step with Singapore’s progress over the past decades, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (May 25) he hopes that JTC Corporation will continue to build on its legacy of “high standards and bold ambitions”. Mr Lee, who was the guest of honour at JTC's 50th anniversary dinner, said the national industrial estate developer has been constantly “pushing boundaries, breaking new ground and building new partnerships”.  In doing so, it played an important role in Singapore’s transformation from third world to first. Established in 1968 as Jurong Town Corporation “in circumstances of great urgency”, its primary role was \"an ambitious project\" to develop Jurong, which was then mostly a swamp, into a modern industrial hub. There were many sceptics who did not believe the Jurong project would ever succeed, said Mr Lee at the event held at Shangri-La Hotel. But they were proven wrong when by 1968, almost 300 factories had been built in the area, providing 21,000 jobs. Further efforts to develop Jurong soon followed and it became a \"vast canvas\" for JTC to experiment and implement urban development plans. “These plans were visionary then, and remain relevant today,” said the prime minister, citing how Jurong had a large town centre with shops and facilities like a drive-in cinema, as well as Singapore’s first childcare centre and hawker centre. Jurong also was the “natural location” to build a bird park because by then, it was no longer “a land where even birds refused to lay eggs”, Mr Lee quipped. As Singapore’s industrialisation plans took off, JTC's portfolio expanded to include the building and management of industrial estates and flatted factories all over Singapore. To reflect its expanded territory, it was renamed as JTC Corporation. Later as Singapore’s economy evolved, JTC's mission changed but it remained involved in every step of the way. For instance, it pulled off the “huge achievement” to form Jurong Island through reclamation and consolidation of islands and reefs off the south-western coast, and convinced petrochemical companies to set up plants there. This helped to make Singapore the world’s third largest oil refining centre even though it had no energy supplies of its own, large land areas or any natural advantages, said Mr Lee. In more recent times, JTC’s “tradition of innovating and taking on new challenges” could be seen in “truly ground-breaking projects”, such as the Jurong Rock Caverns. Being Southeast Asia’s first commercial underground storage facility for liquid hydrocarbons, the Jurong Rock Caverns is “an engineering and construction marvel” which involved JTC overcoming challenging geological and ground conditions, as well as water seepages into the caverns during construction, said Mr Lee.  As Singapore transitioned to a more knowledge-based and technology-intensive economy, JTC developed the Science Park, one-north and CleanTech Park to support hi-tech research and development sectors. It has also since updated its portfolio to provide new infrastructure for the local industries, such as the planning of the Jurong Innovation District (JID) and Punggol Digital District (PDD).  “You continue to focus your resources on areas which the private sector is unable or unwilling to do.\" Mr Lee said JTC's track record showed how it has come a long way to grow in step with Singapore’s progress. “Your 50th anniversary is an important milestone,” he said. “I hope you will continue to build on this tradition of high standards and bold ambitions. Because every JTC success is a benefit for Singaporeans.” “You help bring in investments, and create jobs. You enhance Singapore’s international reputation for quality and excellence. And as you push our physical boundaries and renew our urban landscape, you remind Singaporeans that we are only limited by our imagination.”   OPPORTUNE TIME TO REFLECT AND COMMIT TO LEGACY: JTC CHAIRMAN Chairman Loo Choon Yong described the 50th anniversary as “an opportune time” for JTC to reflect and commit itself to its legacy amid a new world defined by uncertain global geopolitics, an accelerating technological revolution and changing domestic demographics.  Its commitments moving forward include embracing the Singapore model of development.  “This means not pursuing economic growth alone, but striking a fine balance between the economic, social, and environmental. This is a developmental approach with a long-term view, and has created a very liveable environment that makes Singapore an investment destination of choice,\" said Dr Loo.  As such, JTC will be announcing initiatives and inviting industry partners to contribute towards greener estates. It will also work to retain the “tradition of embracing ambitious visions”, while continuing to build on the close partnership with fellow economic agencies and business communities.  The latter is “especially critical” given that now is the start of an industrial revolution, said Dr Loo.  “In all our estates new and old, our future success will depend on how well we work together to organise ourselves to accommodate new methods of production, new ways to bring products to market, and new ways to meet the expectations of the future workforce. As not all the answers are entirely clear at the moment, there is a need for constant experimentation.”  Noting how some areas, such as one-north, have become test-beds for new ideas and technologies, he added: “We will continue to strengthen these collaborations in local business communities to enhance business resilience, and create new opportunities for enterprise and industry transformation.” As part of the celebrations on Friday, Mr Lee sealed a time capsule containing a variety of items, such as old brochures and books from past industrial projects, as well as photos and publications that showcase JTC’s current work.  The time capsule will be installed on Jun 1 – the day when JTC was formed 50 years ago – at its Jurong Town Hall headquarters. It will be opened during JTC’s 75th anniversary.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hope-for-jtc-to-continue-tradition-of-high-standards-and-bold-10278142"}, {"datetime": "25 May 2018 07:43PM", "tags": ["ICA", "traffic", "Tuas Checkpoint"], "author": "", "title": "Lorry catches fire near Tuas Checkpoint; causes heavy traffic, lane closures", "content": " SINGAPORE: A lorry caught fire near Tuas Checkpoint on Friday afternoon (May 25), causing heavy traffic and lane closures, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).  In a Facebook post at 5pm, ICA said that the incident along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim Road was causing heavy departure traffic at Tuas Checkpoint.  The fire was extinguished by the Singapore Civil Defence Force at about 3.50pm, it added.

On Tuesday, Hyflux applied to the Singapore High Court to commence a court-supervised process to reorganise its liabilities and businesses. The company also announced that it would be skipping the upcoming coupon interest payment on its S$500 million perpetual securities.  Moody’s noted that this restructuring, which may include a combination of haircuts, debt maturity extension, or interest rates adjustments, could lead to financial losses for its creditors. These include around 30 financial institutions that are mostly Singapore branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks, according to Moody's citing Hyflux's annual report.  However, with most large power generation companies here having “strong shareholders with diversified portfolios of generation assets”, Moody’s does not view Hyflux’s problems as “symptomatic of a general deterioration in the asset quality of banks' loans to other large infrastructures companies in Singapore”.  \"In addition, these companies' power assets were mostly commissioned some years ago, implying that the debt load on these projects would be more manageable when compared with Hyflux's Tuaspring, which was commissioned in 2015,\" added Moody's vice-president and senior credit officer Eugene Tarzimanov. “The risk that they would follow Hyflux’s restructuring path is low.”  In the case of Hyflux, it had a large amount of secured debt, which heightened the risk to its unsecured creditors.  Moody's report pointed out that the company’s loans and borrowings are dominated by banks. It pointed out that 68 per cent of Hyflux's debt is unsecured, with 51 per cent in the form of unsecured bank loans.  The recent development could mean losses for these creditors.  One of them would be the Singapore branch of Malayan Banking Berhad though potential losses “should be limited”, said Moody's. In 2013, Maybank had agreed to provide an 18-year, S$720 million financing facility to desalination and electricity generation plant Tuaspring.  \"The loss-making Tuaspring project has become the centre of Hyflux's problems because low electricity prices have dampened its electricity generation revenue.

Keropok lekor is a traditional Malay fish cracker snack made primarily from fish and sago flour. “Fake food is in the spotlight again. This time, things just became hotter with a circulating video of a man lighting up a piece of keropok lekor, allegedly made of plastic,” AVA wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday (May 24). The video, first uploaded by Facebook user Anissul Asaad on Tuesday, shows a man in front of a keropok stall at Geylang Ramadan bazaar.  In full view of workers manning the stall, he uses a lighter to set fire to the fried treat.  “Please don’t sell this, it’s plastic. Can real ‘keropok lekor’ burn like this? What I mean is, don’t sell, cannot sell ... better don’t sell, for health reasons. This is plastic! I know from the smell,” he told stall attendants while holding up the flaming fish cracker. Towards the end of the video, a child can be heard exclaiming: “I’m so sad, I just ate something that is plastic.” “Before you jump to any conclusions, we would like to clarify that we have not received any feedback on the cracker, and have not detected any fake food (i.e. food made with synthetic materials) in Singapore thus far,” AVA said. AVA also debunked the belief that the fish cracker was made of plastic, explaining that food products can burn in a similar continuous manner and become charred if it contains fats, carbohydrates and protein. As of Friday, the video received around 476,000 views and was shared 5,300 times. Many commenters also spoke out in support of the stall-owners and criticised the ignorance of the man in the video. “If you burn plastic first, the chemical starts to come together to form a liquid, thus dripping onto the surface with a greenish colour … (the keropok) became black because whatever you burn also (becomes) black,” said one netizen. Before believing or spreading such “fake news”, AVA advised the public to “exercise good judgment” on the credibility of the information source. AVA also reminded the public to refer to official information sources including AVA’s website and social media platforms.

On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, manufacturing output increased 0.2 per cent last month. Electronics output expanded 11.3 per cent in April compared to the same month a year ago, said EDB. The semiconductors and computer peripherals segments recorded output growth of 15.4 per cent and 7.6 per cent respectively, while the rest of the electronic segments registered output declines.  Cumulatively, the electronics cluster’s output increased 17.1 per cent from January to April this year, compared to the same period last year, said EDB. Output from the precision engineering cluster grew 7.2 per cent in April compared to a year ago. The machinery & systems segment grew 7.7 per cent, on account of the higher production of process control equipment, refrigerating systems and semiconductor-related equipment, the agency said.  The precision modules & components segment increased 6.3 per cent with higher production of metal precision components that support the electronics industry. Additionally, production of other fabricated metal products such as those used in the oil and gas industry registered an increase.  On a year-to-date basis, the precision engineering cluster grew 12.2 per cent, compared to the same period last year. There was growth in other clusters too, with the chemicals cluster's output increasing 12.4 per cent year-on-year and output of the transport engineering cluster going up 8.3 per cent, said EDB. For the chemicals cluster, growth was led by the petrochemicals segment which posted robust growth of 27.1 per cent, due in part to the low base last year when some plants were shut for maintenance. The transport engineering cluster’s growth was mainly attributed to the aerospace and land transport segments, which expanded 22.2 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively. However, the marine & offshore engineering segment contracted 5.8 per cent. Biomedical manufacturing output rose 8.2 per cent last month. Pharmaceuticals output grew 10.7 per cent on the back of higher production in pharmaceutical and biological products while the medical technology segment increased 2.5 per cent, said EDB.

Wee Teong Boo, 67, is on trial for allegedly raping his patient, who was then a 23-year-old student, in 2015 during a late-night consultation at his clinic in Bedok. The victim, who cannot be named due to a gag order, had made a police report the day after the alleged crime took place. Wee was cross-examined by prosecutors as he took the stand on Thursday, the 10th day of the trial. The court heard that the day after the alleged crime took place, three police officers had gone to Wee’s clinic and informed him that a complaint had been made against him. Shortly after that, officers accompanied Wee to his home to seize the clothes he had been wearing the day the alleged crime took place. During the cross-examination by Deputy Public Prosecutor Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz, Wee admitted that he saw police officer ASP Razali Razak retrieve the wrong pair of underwear from the laundry basket. He did not tell the police that he was still wearing the underwear they were looking for. When asked by the DPP why he did not clarify or explain this to ASP Razali at that time, Wee responded that he “chose not to”. Upon further questioning, he explained that he did not think the police would have believed him. “A lot of things were crossing my mind at that time,” he added. When further pressed, Wee muttered, “If the police want to be stupid, there’s nothing I can do.” He later apologised for the remark. The underwear Wee had been wearing at the time the alleged crime took place was seized two days later.   GLOVES DURING PELVIC EXAMS NOT MANDATORY: WEE Prosecutors also raised more questions about why Wee had not put on gloves or used lubricant during the pelvic examination he had performed on the alleged victim, which involved him inserting two fingers into her vagina. Wee had earlier explained that he did not use gloves or lubricant as he was “caught off-guard” and his mind was in “pure examination mode”. In response to questions from prosecutors, Wee agreed he was concerned when the police officers showed up at his clinic the day after the alleged crime took place. He added that as he had not been told what the complaint was about, his “mind had jumped” to the pelvic examination he had performed the night before. That was because, contended DPP Sripathy-Shanaz, Wee knew that what he had done the night before was wrong. This was disputed by Wee, who pointed out that it is not mandatory for gloves to be used during pelvic examinations. “It is recommended (to wear gloves), but not mandatory,” he said. In response, the DPP asked Wee if he thought it was “logical” that his mind had jumped to the pelvic examination because he had accepted that it was wrong. “That (examination) was the only thing I could think of,” Wee responded. He explained that the patient may have interpreted that he was “doing something out of the ordinary”. “To her, that might be inappropriate.” Wee was charged with rape and molest on Feb 24 last year. If convicted of rape, he faces 20 years in jail and a fine. The maximum penalty for outrage of modesty is two years’ jail, fine, caning, or any combination of punishments. However, as Wee is above 50 years old, no caning will be imposed.  The trial continues on Friday, with the prosecution expected to continue their cross-examination of Wee.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/trial-doctor-rape-patient-silent-police-seized-underwear-10275126"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 08:12PM", "tags": ["Football Association of Singapore", "Nur Alam Shah"], "author": "", "title": "FAS to help raise funds for family of late former footballer Nur Alam Shah", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) will be helping to raise funds for the family of the late Nur Alam Shah, a former Woodlands Wellington player who died of heart attack last Friday (May 18).  The FAS will be donating all proceeds from the Singapore Premier League match between the Young Lions and the Warriors on Saturday (May 26) to the family \"to help them through this difficult period\", it said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   \"The late Nur Alam Shah's contributions to football through coaching young players, in particular the non-profit Combined Schools FC, were admirable and inspirational,\" the FAS said.  \"The former Woodlands Wellington FC player had a compassionate heart and shared his love for the sport with the youths he coached.\" Alam Shah, 38, had been raising money for his four-year-old son's surgeries.

All services segments expanded during the first three months of 2018, with the finance and insurance segment as the star performer as growth quickened to 9.1 per cent from 6.3 per cent.  MTI permanent secretary Loh Khum Yean told reporters at a media briefing that while weak spots remained, growth improvements “are gradually spreading out to the rest of the economy”.  This has made at least one economist turn more bullish on the outlook ahead.  Maybank Kim Eng economist Chua Hak Bin on Thursday upgraded his full-year GDP forecast to 3.5 per cent from 3.1 per cent, “to reflect the stronger services uplift and more modest manufacturing slowdown”.  “We expect continued resilience in outward-oriented services and firmer recovery in domestically-oriented services, which will help offset the easing in manufacturing and trade,” he said.  While other economists are standing pat on their estimates for now, they agree that the services sector looks poised to make up for lost ground when manufacturing growth eventually tapers due to less favourable base effects.  DBS senior economist Irvin Seah said services will be the “main impetus” for growth in the coming quarters as high frequency data on services, such as loan growth and financial market turnovers, continue to increase.  “While growth in the manufacturing sector will moderate as global economic conditions normalise, the strength in the services sector is likely to persist, thanks to positive spillover from the global recovery to the domestic sector.”  Growth spurred by healthy external demand has also broadened beyond outward-oriented services sectors, such as finance and insurance, to domestically-oriented service sectors like retail and food services, said OCBC's head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling. This will bode well for GDP growth to sustain for the rest of 2018, she added.  Taken together, this has given the Government confidence to slash the lower end of its growth forecast to a range of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, an upgrade from the previous estimate of 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, said CIMB Private Bank economist Song Seng Wun.  “It’s been so far so good this year and that has given them confidence to, at least, cut out a low-growth scenario.” SPEED BUMPS? Economists also reckon that the construction industry, which has thus far continued to languish, may see better days by the end of the year.  The ongoing collective sale fever and broad-based pick-up in the residential property segment will be driving factors, said Mr Seah, who added that the turnaround in the quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted growth figure after four consecutive quarters of contraction is a “clear sign that the worst is over”.  Still, risks linger ahead - the simmering trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies, among them.  “Despite selective imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium, there hasn’t been a significant impact because these make up only a small proportion of global trade. Besides, so far it’s just been talk,” said Mr Song. “But, these can still have some impact on business and consumer confidence.”  The other risk that has emerged on the radar is the spike in global oil prices. A combination of factors, including the economic and political crisis in Venezuela, has shored up oil prices.  On Thursday, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were last seen at US$71.74 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent futures traded at US$79.65 per barrel.  “Although it doesn’t have the same drag on economic activities as it used to 30 years ago, higher energy costs will still inevitably have some marginal drag on economic activities,” he added.  Echoing that, UOB economist Francis Tan said cost-pushed inflationary surprises due to rising global oil prices could result in tighter global financial conditions as central banks turn more hawkish.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/services-uptick-in-q1-shows-growth-broadening-further-in-10274460"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 05:47PM", "tags": ["Central Narcotics Bureau", "crime"], "author": "", "title": "Four arrested in CNB operation, drugs worth over S$28,000 seized", "content": " SINGAPORE: Four suspected drug offenders were arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) while drugs estimated to be worth more than S$28,000 were seized in an operation, said CNB in a news release on Thursday (May 24).  One of the suspects, a 36-year-old woman, was arrested along Jurong Gateway Road on Wednesday late afternoon.

The videos, lasting 16 seconds and 40 seconds, respectively, were provided to Channel NewsAsia by a member of the public on Monday (May 21), and come after news of the drowning of SCDF Corporal (CPL) Kok Yuen Chin in the Tuas View Fire Station pump well on May 13. The person who sent the videos to Channel NewsAsia did not want to be named, and said that they were taken between January and February 2017 at the old Jurong Fire Station, which closed late last year. In a Facebook post on Thursday (May 24), SCDF confirmed those details, describing the content of the videos as a \"ragging incident\". The first video shows what appears to be an SCDF officer being dragged along the floor by several colleagues. The second involves what appears to be the same officer struggling in a water-filled well. In the first video, an officer wearing a \"crew\" T-shirt, work pants and boots is seen being dragged along the floor by two similarly dressed officers. Two other officers, one wearing an SCDF T-shirt, are seen following them. When they reach a flight of steps, the officer being dragged sits up and appears to raise his hands, saying: \"I'm not doing it.\" But his colleagues continue to drag him by the arms and ear down the steps and past a fire engine. Laughter can be heard in the background. The second video also opens with laughter, with what appears to be the same person struggling in a well, with water reaching up to his neck.  The officer can be seen holding on to edge of the well with one hand, while holding onto an SCDF life jacket with the other.  A voice in the background can be heard saying: \"You're still operational you know.\"  Later in the video, voices can be heard saying: \"ORD (operationally ready date) already is it?\"  The video ends with the officer in the well grimacing and saying: \"This is deep.\" Someone is heard replying: \"Do you know how deep it is? \"Deeper than what I told you.\" Replying to questions from Channel NewsAsia, an SCDF spokesperson said on Wednesday that it is \"aware of the videos, and are investigating into the matter\". In its Facebook post on Thursday, SCDF said it \"will not tolerate any ragging or unauthorised initiation activities\". While investigations into how CPL Kok ended up in the well are still ongoing, SCDF has said that it was part of activities to celebrate his impending ORD. Following the incident, Channel NewsAsia reported on SCDF ragging rituals that former personnel said were associated with milestones like ORD.  One of the rituals, called \"kolam\" (Malay for pool), involves pushing ORD personnel into station pump wells. SCDF announced on Wednesday that it would introduce stiffer penalties and other measures to guard against unauthorised activities like ragging.

Khor is also the sole proprietor of Vista Employment Services. The other employment agency charged was Casa Employment Specialist. Investigations revealed that between June and July 2017, Khor and Casa had failed to ensure that two FDWs from Myanmar met the minimum age requirement. The Myanmar nationals were detected at the MOM Services Centre where they subsequently disclosed their actual ages as 13 years old when interviewed by MOM officers. MOM revoked both their applications to work locally and issued directions for Khor and Casa to send the two underage FDWs back to their home country. They were also both barred from seeking employment in Singapore. MOM said the Myanmar Embassy has been informed of the incident. The cases against Khor and Casa have been adjourned to Jun 14 for a Further Mention. If found guilty, they each face a fine of up to S$5,000, six months’ imprisonment, or both. On top of court-imposed penalties, MOM can also revoke their employment agency license and forfeit their security deposit. Both employment agencies have also been served with notices of license suspension. MOM reminded employment agencies to exercise their duty of care towards their clients and take additional steps to verify the ages of the FDWs. Additionally, MOM said FDWs are notified of Singapore’s entry requirements prior to their arrival through the In-Principle Approval letter in their native language. “Upon arrival, all first-time FDWs are required to attend the mandatory Settling-In Programme (SIP) and will be informed of the consequences if they are found to be underage,” MOM said. Detection of underage FDWs also takes place at the SIP training centre and at the MOM Services Centre. MOM added that in the last three years, it has taken enforcement action against 98 employment agencies for failing to ensure that FDWs, who came to Singapore for work through their agencies, met the age requirement. “We urge employers to be vigilant in their selection of FDWs,\" MOM said. \"They should clarify with their EAs if they have doubts of workers’ age or other credentials. An FDW requires the maturity and ability to cope with work and stress, or she may not be able to care for the young and/or old placed under their charge.\" If employers suspect that an FDW recommended by an employment agency is not at least 23 years old, they should not engage the agency’s services and should make a report to MOM.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/13-year-old-maids-employment-agencies-foreign-domestic-workers-10273984"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 03:23PM", "tags": ["safety", "IKEA"], "author": "", "title": "IKEA Singapore recalls SLADDA bicycle due to fall risk caused by drive belt", "content": " SINGAPORE: IKEA Singapore announced a recall on Thursday (May 24) for its SLADDA bicycle due to fall risks caused by its drive belt.  \"The drive belt can suddenly snap, which in turn can lead to falls,\" IKEA said.  They were informed and advised by a well-established component supplier over the safety issue.  There have been eleven reports of such incidents in Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Germany, with two involving minor injuries, IKEA said.

Uber had exited these markets after Grab announced it had acquired its Southeast Asia operations in March, though the deal is still being scrutinised by regulators. The firm said it will work with regulators and other stakeholders to prepare for the new operations, and that is has received a \"positive\" response so far. \"I think a lot of governments and regulators have been actively welcoming competition in each of their countries because that's healthy and good for the consumer,\" said Mr Makarim. \"Our aim is to partner with countries and their governments to bring benefit to everyone who uses our technology whether consumers looking for fast, competitive services, or drivers looking to secure additional income.\" However, not all services will be available in every country. For example, Go-Jek's motorcycle taxi service will not be replicated in Singapore. \"I think that we have to be respectful to both the market sentiment as well as the regulatory climate of each of the countries, and so we are extremely cognizant of maintaining good relations with each of the local stakeholders,\" Mr Makarim added. GO-JEK TO HAVE \"SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE\" IN PARTNER COUNTRIES Go-Jek noted in the press release that while it will provide the technological support to its chosen partner countries, local founding teams will run the companies that Go-Jek will help set up.  Mr Makarim stated that the company would have a \"significant presence\" in each country, but its philosophy would be to give the local teams autonomy. \"I think we're going to put a lot of trust in the autonomy of the local teams and have them make autonomous and critical strategic decisions about where to go, and where to take their countries,\" he said. \"The local companies will determine their own brands and identities to ensure good traction in each new market,\" said the transport firm.  \"Our role will be to act as advisors, giving the new companies the benefit of our operational and development experience so they can take the spirit with which we created Go-Jek and find the best way to achieve that locally,\" added Mr Makarim. He expressed ambivalence when asked whether Go-Jek will retain its brand name as it expands into other Southeast Asian markets.  \"Depending on what the local teams say in terms of what brand will resonate much greater in that local market, then we will make that decision. \"I think one of the really unique and interesting things about Go-Jek is that we don't mind if a country owns their own brand and creates something that is a different brand other than just Go-Jek,\" he noted. Replying to Channel NewsAsia's queries, the Land Transport Authority said that it has reached out to Go-Jek to share the regulatory requirements it needs to meet in order to operate in Singapore.  \"All prospective private hire car booking service operators will need to comply with LTA's existing regulatory requirements before being allowed to operate in Singapore,\" a spokesperson said in an email.  To ensure that the industry remains open and contestable in the long term, the authority is also \"reviewing the regulatory structure of the point-to-point industry\". This is also to make sure that no single operator dominates the market to the detriment of commuters and drivers, added the spokesperson.  Go-Jek's expansion comes after it received investment from firms such as Google, JD.com, Tencent and Temasek. The company currently offers services like transportation, logistics, mobile payments, food delivery in various cities in Indonesia. It announced late last year that it plans to expand into Southeast Asian markets, starting with the Philippines.  Additional reporting by Chandni Vatvani", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/go-jek-to-enter-singapore-philippines-thailand-vietnam-10273010"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 09:28AM", "tags": ["schools", "education"], "author": "Tan Si Hui", "title": "Online learning portal to be rolled out for all schools by end-May", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new online learning portal will be rolled out to all schools, from primary to junior college level, by the end of May, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in response to media queries. The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) was piloted at 62 primary and secondary schools in August last year, and the portal has been progressively rolled out to other schools in phases since February. The platform aims to enhance the learning of various subjects including science, history, social studies and mathematics. Feedback from teachers and students have been positive so far, the ministry said. English language teacher Lu Suxin at East Spring Secondary School has been using the portal during its pilot phase to teach students how to analyse language and text. She said she has seen improvement in her students’ work since the portal was introduced. “In the recent mid-year examinations, I saw some improvement in the quality of their answers on how they are able to answer questions and interpret the different literary devices given to them,” said Ms Lu. SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING One of the features of the SLS is that it promotes self-directed learning. Students can learn at their own pace, revisit concepts and read up on other areas of interest.  Secondary 3 student Ngiam Li Jia at East Spring Secondary School said she prefers the individualised form of learning on the SLS compared to old-school methods of teaching, which sees a teacher-student ratio of 1:20. “I can log in to the portal any time, anywhere, and I can look at classes again,” she said. “It also helps deepen my understanding of a subject because it’s a personalised platform. It tells me where I went wrong and what I don’t understand, allowing me to focus on my weaker areas.” The online portal also encourages collaborative learning through peer assignment assessments. Students can discuss their answers with other students through the portal and teachers can give feedback and bridge learning gaps. Feedback and responses are presented in the form of a heat map that consolidates students’ responses and allows teachers to assess their understanding. The map is colour-coded for efficient monitoring – red means the answer is wrong, green shows the answer is correct and orange signifies that the answer is partially correct. A red danger sign will also appear if more than half of the students do not get the right answers. Fengshan Primary School teacher Veronica Guo, who co-designed a common mother tongue language lesson in SLS for Primary 3 and 4 students, said the platform has helped to keep the students engaged. “For primary school students, we need to get their attention and we need to keep them engaged. The engagement level that students have now is definitely higher when children get to collaborate easily,” said Mdm Guo. LIMITATIONS OF ONLINE PORTAL But East Spring Secondary School staff developer Noreha Nordin, who co-designed her school’s lessons, said there are limitations to the online platform. \"We had to link up to a third-party tool like Google Docs in order for groups of students to collaborate in real-time while using SLS. Perhaps in the future, we can see all these tools being incorporated into SLS.\" In response, MOE said it will continue to gather feedback from students and teachers and work towards enhancing the portal further.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/online-learning-portal-schools-singapore-student-learning-space-10269418"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 08:58AM", "tags": ["business"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore exports up 1.1% in Q1 as total trade expands", "content": " SINGAPORE: Non-oil domestic exports in Singapore grew 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, slowing from 10.4 per cent in the previous quarter, according to data released by Enterprise Singapore on Thursday (May 24).Exports of non-electronic products rose by 4.5 per cent over the year in Q1, following the 14.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. \"The largest contributors to the increase in non-electronic exports were food preparations (136.7 per cent), non-electric engines and motors (184.5 per cent) and specialised machinery (10.9 per cent),\" Enterprise Singapore said.  Meanwhile, electronic exports declined by 7.9 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, after five quarters of growth.  \"Integrated circuit parts of PCs and diodes & transistors declined by 9.8 per cent, 43.9 per cent and 16.8 per cent respectively, and they contributed the most to the decrease in electronic non-oil domestic exports,\" Enterprise Singapore said.  Overall, the growth for Singapore’s exports is expected to remain firm in 2018 but ease from 2017’s strong performance, the agency said, with projections maintained at 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent. TOTAL MERCHANDISE TRADE GREW FOR SIXTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER On a year-on-year basis, Singapore’s total merchandise trade grew by 2.5 per cent for the first three months of 2018, following the 7.8 per cent increase in the previous quarter, as both oil and non-oil trade rose. Oil trade increased by 5.1 per cent in Q1 amid higher oil prices than a year ago, after the 27.7 per cent growth in the previous quarter.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Thursday (May 24) that it now expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2018 to come in at 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, compared with the previous estimate of between 1.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. Official data also showed the economy expanded by 4.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of this year, faster than the 3.6 per cent in the previous three months, with manufacturing as its strongest growth driver. The year-on-year expansion is slightly higher than the Government’s initial estimate of 4.3 per cent, as well as forecasts from economists polled by Reuters who had similar expectations. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, Singapore’s GDP grew 1.7 per cent, moderating from the 2.1 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. However, this is higher than the official forecast and Reuters’ poll that had expected quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.4 per cent. SECTOR BREAKDOWN For the first quarter, the manufacturing sector, which accounts for one-fifth of the economy, grew by 9.8 per cent year-on-year, extending the 4.8 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The sector’s growth was primarily driven by the electronics, precision engineering and chemicals clusters. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, the manufacturing sector expanded by 22.1 per cent, a turnaround from the 14.8 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. Also seeing an acceleration is the finance and insurance sector which quickened to 9.1 per cent growth year-on-year, from 6.3 per cent in the previous quarter, propped up by robust growth in the fund management, financial intermediation and insurance segments. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, the sector expanded by 4.5 per cent, moderating from the 12.6 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of last year. These two sectors contributed the most to GDP over the first quarter and together, they accounted for 68 per cent of overall growth during the three-month period. Among others, the wholesale and retail trade sector expanded by 3.0 per cent year-on-year, unchanged from the growth recorded in the previous quarter, with the wholesale trade segment being supported by an increase in the wholesale sales volume of petroleum products. The retail trade segment contracted, weighed down by a fall in the volume of motor vehicle sales. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, the wholesale and retail trade sector shrank by 11.2 per cent, a pullback from the 6.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter. The construction sector remained the underperformer with a contraction of 5.0 per cent year-on-year, the same pace of decline as in the previous quarter. Construction output was weighed down by continued weakness in both public sector and private sector construction activities. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, the sector grew by 1.7 per cent, reversing the 0.2 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. INCREASING DOWNSIDE RISKS IN GLOBAL ECONOMY In its report, MTI said the global economy has remained on a steady expansionary path since the start of the year, with full-year growth expected to improve slightly as compared to 2017. However, alongside the improvement in the growth outlook of some of the key economies, uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy have also increased since early 2018. These include the recent protectionist actions and tariff measures by the US, which have increased the risk of an escalation of global trade tensions. This could adversely affect international trade as well as dampen investor and consumer confidence, in turn weighing on global growth. When asked if the recent agreement between the US and China to avoid a trade war could eliminate or mitigate this risk, Ms Yong Yik Wei, director at MTI’s economics division, said the Government is monitoring developments closely and is “cautiously optimistic” of this latest development. While there are broader concerns relating to the risk of an escalation, she added that the direct impact of existing tariffs on the Singapore economy is expected to be “limited”.  This is because the products affected by the US tariffs on products, like solar cells and steel, only account for 0.09 per cent of the country’s total domestic exports. Meanwhile, against the backdrop of rising global interest rates and generally tightening financial conditions, financial vulnerabilities in emerging market economies could surface, particularly for those with elevated debt levels, including in the region. If this occurs, there could be some pullback in investment and consumption growth in these economies. On balance, the pace of growth in the Singapore economy is expected to remain firm in 2018, with growth supported primarily by outward-oriented sectors. In particular, the manufacturing sector is likely to continue to expand on the back of sustained growth in the electronics and precision engineering clusters, albeit at a more moderate pace as compared to 2017. Likewise, outward-oriented services sectors such as finance and insurance, transportation and storage and wholesale trade are projected to continue to benefit from healthy external demand. Growth is also expected to broaden to domestically oriented services sectors like retail and food services over the course of the year, on the back of an improvement in consumer sentiments amidst the on-going recovery in the labour market. But the construction sector is likely to remain lacklustre as the earlier weakness in construction demand, particularly from the private sector, is expected to continue to weigh on construction activities this year. Taking into account the strong performance of the Singapore economy in the first quarter and the slightly improved external demand outlook for Singapore, the MTI said it expects GDP growth for 2018 to come in between 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, barring the full materialisation of downside risks.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-q1-2018-gdp-growth-mti-10271776"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["Circles.Life", "telcos", "mobile plans", "data"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Upstart Circles.Life looks to ring in changes in Singapore’s telecoms sector", "content": " SINGAPORE: Since its launch in May of 2016, virtual network operator Circles.Life has positioned itself as the plucky upstart keen on shaking things up in Singapore’s stale telecoms sector.  An emphasis on customer service and data-centric mobile plans characterise the start-up's push to stand out from the crowd.  It got off to a rocky start though, with reports of missing SIM card deliveries, botched number porting and unresponsive customer hotlines among the brickbats thrown in its direction. Co-founder Rameez Ansar took this head on when he went On the Record with Bharati Jagdish last year to discuss how the company tackled issues like botched number porting and lack of responsiveness in its customer service. Mr Ansar said then he acknowledged that some customers had faced issues when signing up, and it needed to keep improving in this area, though there were also positives like 30 to 40 per cent of its users coming from referrals. Fast forward to today.  Another co-founder, Mr Abhishek Gupta, told Channel NewsAsia in an interview that Circles.Life's focus continues to be on making customer service responsive and easily available. Pointing to its CirclesCare mobile app, Mr Gupta said customers can engage in a live chat with a company representative from the app, and “at no point will they need to wait more than 60 seconds for a reply”.  At the end of the conversation, there will also be an option to request for a transcript of the session, which will be sent to the user’s email, he showed during a demo.  Mr Gupta leads fundraising, finance, investor management, partnership and growth, and he was previously a private equity investor with Bain Capital and Standard Chartered Private Equity. The 35-year-old is a Singapore Airlines scholar who graduated from Hwa Chong junior college. The efforts appear to have paid off, with the company declaring it had reached its target of a 3-5 per cent share of Singapore's market by 2019 \"ahead of time\".  Mr Gupta declined to give specific figures, but said its current customer base is “a few hundreds of thousands”. CIRCLES.LIFE’S SECRET SAUCE It's not just customer service that Circles.Life is banking on, however.  Mr Gupta was keen to highlight the technology platform it built from scratch - Circles-X - that allows it to quickly introduce the many data-driven mobile plans it has since brought to market.  Pay S$28 a month, and you’ll get 6GB of mobile data. The operator will also throw in free caller ID and unlimited WhatsApp access in its base plan. This March, a mobile plan whereby customers can pay S$3 for a day’s worth of unlimited mobile data was launched. It followed that up by unveiling a plan giving subscribers 1GB of data for free monthly, as well as some talk time and SMS messages, earlier this week. How then does its much-touted Circles-X tool play a part in making all these products possible? The company describes Circles-X as a cloud-based technology that automates telco systems such as OSS/BSS (operations support system/business support system), the mailing system to send monthly bills to subscribers, server management, network operations centre, analytics, etc. There are 25 telecoms systems altogether, but the key difference is this: The Singapore start-up took the time to look at all the systems telcos needed and, from there, created a “leaner, more nimble” platform to operate on, Mr Gupta explained. In fact, it took two-and-a-half-years for the 25-strong engineering team to bring the disparate systems together and create Circles-X. Among them were alums of Viber, a messaging app that was bought by Japanese giant Rakuten for US$900 million in 2014, and Skype which was bought over by Microsoft in 2011, the co-founder revealed. Asked how this platform is different from what the full-fledged telcos have, Mr Gupta said the latter would usually have many disparate systems in their backend, with some hosted on premise while others are provisioned on cloud computing platforms. This meant integration issues, with different systems “not able to speak to each other” unless application programming interfaces (APIs) are developed for this purpose. It will also be difficult for these companies to introduce new services quickly, he added. Taking its WhatsApp Passport as an example, Mr Gupta said its engineering team simply needed to add a \"button\" to the customer-facing mobile app, and make sure this button is tied back to the provisioning systems at the back. By comparison, the usual practice for telcos would be to raise a request for proposal (RFP) for an external vendor to add the button and later on, raise another RFP for another vendor to make sure the button integrates with legacy backend systems, which makes the whole process complex and time-consuming, the executive said. “There is a lack of alignment between the different teams internally,” he said, adding this usually leads to finger-pointing when the project hits a hitch. And because Circles-X is hosted on the cloud, Mr Gupta said this makes it easier for them to collaborate with other organisations to roll out products and promotions. It did so with DBS Bank, for example, when it allowed the latter's customers to pay for data add-ons using their DBS points, he pointed out. Another benefit of having its backend system on the cloud is the ability to expand to other markets quickly: \"You just need to replicate the system virtually,\" Mr Gupta explained. This is why Circles.Life has stated its intention to expand to other regional markets, starting with Indonesia some time in the second half of this year. There are currently “between 10 and 15 employees” situated in Jakarta currently, the co-founder revealed, and the operator will be targeting urban cities for launch in the initial phases. These include Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Bali, Bogor, Semarang and Jogjakarta, the executive elaborated. “Indonesia is a gold market for us,” Mr Gupta said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/upstart-circles-life-looks-to-ring-in-changes-in-singapore-s-10257610"}, {"datetime": "24 May 2018 06:33AM", "tags": [], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Singapore maintains 3rd position in world ranking for competitiveness", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore has held on to its spot as the world’s third-most competitive economy in an annual ranking released on Thursday (May 24) by Switzerland-based research group IMD World Competitiveness Centre.  The United States took the top spot, propelled by high rankings in the economic performance and infrastructure categories. It leapfrogged from last year’s fourth position to displace Hong Kong – last year’s leader – which slipped to the second spot.  Rounding up the top five were the Netherlands and Switzerland. The former moved up one spot due to a “balanced” performance in all categories, while the latter fell three positions to be ranked fifth with an export slowdown among contributing factors.  Professor Arturo Bris, director of the IMD World Competitiveness Centre, described the high-ranking economies as having “an above-the-average performance across all competitiveness factors” though their competitiveness mix varies.  “One economy, for example, may build its competitiveness strategy around a particular aspect such as its tangible and intangible infrastructure. Another may approach competitiveness through their governmental efficiency,” he added.  In the case of Singapore, strong government efficiency remained its biggest asset.  However, the city-state continues to be challenged by high levels of private debt in the economy and high prices. Contributed mainly by the real estate sector, the latter hampers quality of life and talent attraction.  “When we talk about competitiveness, we are also talking about the quality of life. With real estate prices being a very important component, Singapore remains an expensive country,” said Professor Bris.  The report also cited other challenges, which included strengthening the capability of enterprises to innovate, raise productivity and internationalise, as well as equipping its workforce with relevant skills to ride on new opportunities. Across Asia, the economies saw a mixed bag of results in this year’s ranking of 63 countries benchmarked against 258 indicators.  While China (13th), Japan (25th), South Korea (27th), Malaysia (22nd) and India (44th) saw improvements, Taiwan (17th), Thailand (30th) and Indonesia (43rd) slipped down the charts.  The Philippines posted the biggest decline compared to its regional peers, moving down nine places to be in the 50th position. This is due to a decline in tourism and employment, worsening of public finances and a surge in concerns about the education system.  Despite that, Professor Bris said: “This does not mean that Asia is less competitive, (it’s) just that some countries have moved faster.”  For instance, a majority of Eastern European economies, such as Poland (34th), Slovenia (37th) and Hungary (47th) have advanced by least four positions in this year’s rankings.  In the Middle East, almost all the countries showed progress despite an increase in political tensions.

That was the year when the Singapore-based water treatment specialist saw its market capitalisation peak at an eye-popping S$2.1 billion, while raking up another high in revenue and net profit on the back of rapid growth. But fast forward eight years, and the homegrown firm sent ripples through Singapore for a very different reason. On Tuesday (May 22), Hyflux said it had applied to the High Court to begin a court-supervised process of debt and business reorganisation – an announcement that some market observers told Channel NewsAsia “has been a long time coming”. The company blamed “prolonged weakness” in the local power market for its financial woes, which has led to “short-term liquidity constraints in recent weeks”.

Its rise was synonymous with its founder’s rags-to-riches story. Much has been said about Ms Lum’s challenging early life. Abandoned at birth and later adopted by a widow whom she called \"grandmother\", Ms Lum, a Malaysian, started work from a very young age to support the family. She was determined to do well in school and later moved to Singapore, where she graduated from the National University of Singapore and found a job as a chemist at Glaxo Pharmaceuticals. However, she soon decided to strike it out on her own and founded Hydrochem with “a big dream and youthful idealism” to solve the world’s water problems. The initial years of entrepreneurship weren’t easy. In various interviews done over the years, Ms Lum shared how she worked 14 hours a day to sell water treatment products and systems by knocking on the doors of factories in Singapore and Malaysia. The company got its first break in 1992 when it obtained the exclusive rights from a supplier to distribute membranes and membrane filtration plants to industrial customers. This later paved the way for a research and development team in 1999, which aimed to make its own membranes that would set it apart from competitors. Then came 2001 – the “defining year” when Hyflux, with Hydrochem as its wholly-owned subsidiary, made a splash by becoming the first water treatment company to be listed in Singapore. It also secured its first municipal water treatment project in Singapore to supply and install the process equipment for the country’s first Newater plant in Bedok. Other key projects that followed included Singapore’s third Newater plant in Seletar and the SingSpring Desalination Plant, the country’s first seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant. It also began reaching out further beyond the shores of Singapore, with projects in China, India and the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region, which included Oman and Algeria. In 2011, Ms Lum became the first Singaporean and the first woman to be crowned the Ernst & Young (EY) World Entrepreneur of the Year award. That year, it also clinched Singapore’s second and largest seawater desalination project, and proposed incorporating an on-site 411 megawatt combined cycle power plant to produce electricity for the desalination plant and power grid. MULTIPLYING RISKS But that marked the start of the company’s woes, analysts said. Touted to be the first in Singapore and Asia, the Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Project was expected to raise efficiency levels and reduce the cost of desalination. The power plant, which began operations in 2016, also marked Hyflux’s foray into the energy business. It has, however, been a drag on earnings. For the full year ended Dec 31, 2017, the integrated water and power plant registered a net loss of S$81.9 million, with wholesale electricity prices clearing at levels that are below fuel costs. This contributed in a big way to the company’s first annual loss since listing – a loss of S$116.4 million, compared to a restated profit of S$3.8 million for FY2016. The losing streak continued in the three months to March 31 as Hyflux logged losses of S$22.2 million, widening considerably from a restated loss of S$64,000 a year before. To turn a profit in 2018, a stronger rebound in wholesale electricity prices at a sustained pace will be needed, the company had said. This strain in the balance sheet and financial covenants coming up may have proven too much. The water treatment firm has a coupon payment due May 28 on its S$500 million of 6 per cent perpetual securities, which it has said it will not make. It also has S$100 million of 4.25 per cent bonds that will mature in September. “Hyflux seems to have borrowed too much and the debt is a millstone around your neck when the environment becomes adverse,” said Associate Professor Nitin Pangarkar from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School. While companies with strong balance sheets can survive these downturns, “too much debt can bring down a company”, he warned. In the case of Hyflux, there was “too much risk” that included the oversupply and deregulation of the local electricity market. “These different sources of risk will tend to multiply.” Agreeing, CMC Markets sales trader Oriano Lizza said Hyflux has incurred a mounting debt burden from “over-expansion into additional sectors that (the company) may not be so specialized in”. In addition, market conditions like the massive overcapacity depressing prices and an influx of natural gas as an alternative energy source certainly did not help Hyflux to sizzle in its energy venture. With the company having “overcapitalised too rapidly and spread itself too thin in terms of asset allocation”, Mr Lizza said Tuesday’s announcement \"has been a long time coming\".  For iFast’s senior fixed income analyst Ang Chung Yuh, “the speed at which things went downhill” exceeded his forecasts. He had expected Hyflux to be able to meet its obligations for the next 12 to 18 months.  Mr Ang added that he is also unsure as to why Hyflux opted for a court-driven reorganisation process, instead of first approaching creditors, including bondholders, with a proposal.  “But in any case, if management has crunched the numbers and found that it is impossible for them to come up with the money needed one or two years down the road, we think it is a good thing that management has chosen to bite the bullet now rather than later,” he added. WHAT ARE ITS OPTIONS? Analysts agreed that the 30-day moratorium, which kicked in automatically from the date of Hyflux’s application to court, will buy the company some much-needed time.  Mr Lizza thinks the immediate remedies for Hyflux include turning to its investors and shareholders for additional capital injection or speed up the sale of its existing loss-making assets.  “If they are able to shift these assets for cash in the short term, it will give them continued breathing space until they can balance their books.”  Hyflux said in February last year that it is exploring a partial divestment of Tuaspring, and has also been looking at a potential divestment of its Tianjin Dagang desalination plant. Alongside the release of its first-quarter financial report earlier this month, it said that divestment discussions for these two projects are in progress with interested parties.  But now that things have changed, Hyflux will have to play its cards carefully.  “The problem is that investors will be circling these assets in hope of a bargain because they know the situation that Hyflux is in,” said Mr Lizza. “If they sell too little, it won’t get them out of the current situation but if they are unwilling to budge on current prices, they won’t (get) any interest.”  “They are really in a sticky situation,” he added.  Mr Ang reckons a debt restructuring could be a “virtual certainty”.  “In our opinion, to have some chance of restoring Hyflux’s financial health for the long run, the exercise needs to involve a debt-to-equity conversion of a substantial part of the perpetual securities,” he said, adding that the firm had about S$2.4 billion of debt outstanding at end-March if the perpetual securities are taken into account.  “Short of a Government bailout, it is difficult for us to conceive a scenario where a capital injection by external investors could achieve a sustainable capital structure for Hyflux.”  Hyflux on Wednesday morning called for a suspension of trading in all its shares and related securities, which had been halted since Monday and analysts do not rule out the prospect of heavy selling when it resumes trading.  The route ahead for Hyflux will not be an easy one, experts added.  Describing the trading halt and seeking of court protection as “a broad, open admission of its festering business problems”, NUS Assoc Prof Lawrence Loh said: “Hyflux’s ongoing reorganisation move is necessary to ensure that any asset divestments will get the best value for its stakeholders, particularly creditors and shareholders.”  “While there were already market expectations for the troubles at Hyflux, the issue has probably brewed for a time much longer than necessary. Hyflux has probably seen this coming and could have been more expeditious and decisive in its restructuring efforts along the way,” he added.  As Ms Lum had forewarned in the company’s latest annual report, 2018 was going to “be another challenging year”. But with “boldness, entrepreneurial spirit, customer satisfaction focus, and teamwork”, she said she was confident of overcoming the obstacles ahead. During a 2016 interview with Channel NewsAsia, the award-winning entrepreneur described herself as a “more optimistic person”, and that challenges and uncertainties are the norm for any business.  “I still have the hunger in me,” she said. “Every day, I still look forward to more and more exciting business opportunities and persevere to manage the challenges.”  And with that, all eyes will likely be now on the businesswoman to see if her unique brand of tenacity can reverse the fate of one of Singapore Inc’s most-visible success stories.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-singapore-court-supervision-faces-major-challenges-10260230"}, {"datetime": "23 May 2018 06:29PM", "tags": ["crime", "e-scooters", "accident"], "author": "", "title": "Three men to be charged after accidents involving e-scooters, bicycle", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three men aged between 17 and 37 years old will be charged on Thursday (May 24) for rash or negligent acts after they hit three pedestrians with either their electric scooters or bicycle in three separate incidents, said the police in a news release on Wednesday.

Clinic director Dr David Ng announced this during the official opening of Punggol Polyclinic on Wednesday (May 23). The pilot programme is especially for new mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus who stand a risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later. Under the programme, longer-term care will also be extended to younger children. It will see a closer hand-over of new mothers from the hospital to Punggol Polyclinic, helping to ensure that women focus not only on their children's health, but also their own after giving birth. The polyclinic will also work with the hospital to provide closer follow-up for babies up to the first three years, looking out especially for paediatric obesity.  He added that while there is close follow-up for babies when they attend immunisations during the first 18 months of their lives, there is a tendency for young children to fall through the cracks after that. \"We find that some of them, when they enter school-going age they may not be fully prepared. So this is a focus of attention here.  \"We're collaborating with KK Women's and Children's Hospital to see how we can improve the follow-up of babies for the first three years of their lives, and ensure they have a good start to their life ahead,\" said Dr Ng. This is part of Punggol Polyclinic's focus on women's and children's health services, which caters to the demographic of Punggol residents.  About 11 per cent of its residents are children and were aged four and under in 2017 - the highest proportion of children aged five and below in Singapore.  Since the polyclinic became operational in November, more than 20 per cent of attendance has been for women's and children's health services. FIRST EYE CLINIC IN A POLYCLINIC Additionally, in collaboration with the Singapore National Eye Centre, Punggol Polyclinic will house a Community Eye Clinic from Jul 30, the first eye clinic in a polyclinic setting.  The facility will allow patients with stable eye conditions such as early cataract, stable glaucoma, and diabetic eye conditions to seek follow-up care closer to home, saving on their travel time.

According to the polyclinic's pharmacy manager Ms Teo Hui Ling, the system is able to pack up to 150 prescriptions in an hour, double the capacity of packing by hand.  Aside from that, the polyclinic also makes use of a 24-hour PILBOX system, which allows patients to collect their medication any time from parcel lockers within the polyclinic. Patients can also find out more about their medication by scanning QR codes on an adjacent information wall. This includes commonly-needed information such as the proper use of asthma inhalers.

Among other things, the company has sought a moratorium that will prevent it from being wound up.  The company, whose landmark Tuaspring project was the first integrated water and power project in Asia, marked its first full year of losses in 2017. The company also reported losses in the first quarter of 2018. The weak results come on the back of an oversupply of gas in the Singapore market, which has resulted in depressed electricity prices. Prolonged weakness in the local power market has led to \"increasing strain on the Group’s finances, resulting in short-term liquidity constraints in recent weeks\", the company said in a statement. \"This has been compounded by restrictions on the repatriation of monies into Singapore from projects overseas, as well as increasing amounts having to be placed in fixed deposit accounts as a requirement for performance bonds to be issued or renewed in support of the existing projects,\" it added. Hyflux, which was worth nearly S$2.1 billion at its peak in late 2010, now has a market value of S$165 million, according to Bloomberg. The company's share price has plunged 44 per cent so far this year. It closed at S$0.21 on May 18 before it halted trading ahead of the announcement, compared with S$0.375 at the end of 2017. In a separate letter to stakeholders, Group CEO Olivia Lum said that the move to apply for court supervision was necessary not only to protect the company's viable core businesses, but also position it for long-term sustainable growth. \"In view of the challenging environment, our options are to either maintain the status quo and hope to ride out the storm, or to step back and assess holistically how to reorganise our liabilities,\" she wrote. \"We have therefore decided to be proactive ... (and) commenced a court-supervised liabilities reorganisation exercise for certain entities within the Group,\" she added. The main objective of the exercise is to provide the space and time for the group to focus on its ongoing discussions with strategic investors, optimise operations, target areas for growth and complete outstanding projects in order to keep generating steady cash flow, she said. \"Through this exercise, we believe that we will emerge stronger and be poised for sustainable growth in the years to come,\" she said. Among other things, Hyflux has sought a moratorium preventing potential proceedings against it in Singapore for six months. The moratorium also seeks to prevent legal action against any of its properties. The moratorium will be in effect for 30 days, during which no order may be made and no resolution may be passed for it to be wound up, it said. \"The company is taking this step in order to protect the value of its businesses while it reorganises its liabilities,\" Hyflux said in the statement. As part of the reorganisation process, the board will only make payments critical to the continued operation of the group's businesses. As such, payment of distribution on its S$500 million, 6 per cent Perpetual Capital Securities, due May 28, will not be made, it said.

Muslim personalities on embracing the elusive pre-dawn Ramadan meal", "content": " Follow our new CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos SINGAPORE: When one thinks about Ramadan, the first thing that often comes to mind – for Muslims and non-Muslims alike – is buka puasa. In Malay, it simply means breaking one’s fast.  The meal takes much of the spotlight each Ramadan, with new halal restaurant openings and menu items dominating the headlines.  But there is another meal that doesn’t get much airtime, mostly because it usually happens behind closed doors: Sahur or the pre-dawn meal. Taken between 4am and 5am, it’s when Muslims climb out of bed and putter around in the dark for some last-minute nourishment in preparation for the day ahead.  CNA Lifestyle talks to six busy Muslim personalities to find out what sahur is like for them – and if it’s at all possible to eat healthy when you can barely stay awake.  'SAHUR IS HARD BECAUSE WAKING UP EARLY IS HARD' For Mediacorp actress and host Nurul Aini, the hardest thing about sahur or suhoor as it’s called in Arabic, is getting up for it. “Sahur is hard because waking up (at 4am) is hard,” she said. “I never used to wake up for sahur, but now that my children are fasting as well, we eat as a family, which we enjoy very much.”  Nurul’s helper Dewi has been preparing smoothie bowls for the star, who uploads photos of the creations on Instagram with the hashtag #dewibowls.  This particular recipe contains a smoothie made with frozen banana, mango and pineapple, and poured over a bowl of dragonfruit. The dish is finished with a topping of berries, almonds and granola.  “The effort she puts in to make these is just A+!” Nurul wrote in one social media post. “We run out of fruits every other day,” she shared in another.   While many struggle with work and family during Ramadan, especially when it comes to preparing meals like sahur, Nurul is hoping for a more leisurely time this year.  “I’m not worried at all this year because I’m free from work,” she said. “I was always busy shooting during fasting month, but I put it all aside this year so I can enjoy Ramadan with the family and prepare for Hari Raya.”  QUINOA OVER RICE  Eating sahur as a family – early as it is – has always been a tradition for BeritaMediacorp news anchor Hazlina Abdul Halim.  “Everyone sits at the dining table and we eat together. We might not be able to break our fast together, but we start our fast together. This was the practice in my childhood home and it remains so now that I’m married,” she said.  To fill up for a day of fasting, Hazlina recommends quinoa nasi lemak, a healthier take on the well-loved local dish typically made with rice. “Of course, this is a bit of a treat. Most days, we eat just cereal and cold milk, or spread Nutella on sourdough toast,” she said.  SATISFYING AND ENERGISING Jayina Chan, co-founder of popular online baby food startup Anya Meals, also favours quinoa.  She had been observing the fasting month since before she converted to Islam several years ago, and used to be able to sustain on just dates, fruit, oatmeal, or milk and cereal for sahur. But things changed after she had her first child, after whom the business was named.  “After I got pregnant and started breastfeeding, fasting became more difficult. I would find myself dehydrated and famished by noon,” she said.  Nowadays, she has more satiating meals, such as this pan-grilled rainbow quinoa salad, which can be prepared the night before and keeps in the refrigerator for up to two days.  “The beauty of this quinoa salad is that it slowly releases energy into your body throughout day, unlike white rice, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike quickly, leaving you bloated and sluggish,” said Jayina.   'LESS COOKING, MORE NUTRITION' With her three children and the running of FatPapas’ three outlets, Anna Belle Francis has her hands full this Ramadan.  “On my mother-in-law’s advice, I prepared my home menu for Ramadan way in advance and pasted the list on the fridge. This way, I don’t have to think so hard about what to cook while I’m running the restaurants, going for terawih (prayers) and struggling with little sleep,” she said.  As part of her Ramadan mantra – less cooking, more nutrition – the former TV star said she will be making a lot of her well-loved spinach rosti because the prep can be done the night before and it allows her to be creative with nutrition.  “The potatoes can be prepared earlier. Then, all you need is to top it with healthy ingredients like salad greens, vegetables, grilled chicken or smoked salmon slices. We like ours with a side of cream cheese. “Sandwiches are also a good idea – you can prepare them before hand and use nutritious ingredients like grilled chicken, boiled egg or tuna,” she revealed.  ONE PAN, ONE COMPLETE MEAL Zhulaiha Abdul Rahim also adopts the less hands-on approach for sahur, so that she can spend more time and effort interacting with her three young children.  Zhulaiha, who founded Laugh Play Learn, a creative Malay language learning centre with her husband, is an avid cook and baker who promotes easy, healthy recipes on her popular Instagram page Ovenhaven.  Her passion for nutrition translates into her recommended sahur recipe – one-pan baked chicken with sweet potatoes, which she describes as a “complete meal with complex carbs, proteins and vegetables to keep one full longer”.  “Sometimes, I add a sunny-side up, but it’s great as it is. The best thing about it is that everything goes into one pan and into the oven, which means less clean-up and no working over the stove,” she said. KEEP IT SIMPLE Siti Mastura may be a celebrity chef, but she too prefers to keep it simple for Ramadan with a recipe perfected by her late mother and enjoyed by the family throughout the year, even in times of illness.  “I love bubur lemak halba as it reminds me of my late mother, who would cook a lot of it and heat up a portion each day for the family,” she said. “My whole family loves this and my cooking class students do, too.  “It’s also what we eat when we’re not feeling well.”  The porridge is “light, but filling and very yummy”, said Chef Siti, who counts minced meat, salted egg, peanuts, vegetables and anchovies as its ingredients. The star entry is fenugreek, which she said helps with digestion.  *** RECIPES Jayina's pan-grilled rainbow quinoa salad (serves 4, great hot and cold) Main ingredients:  Toppings and seasoning: Method: Hazlina's quinoa nasi lemak (serves 4)  Main ingredients:  Method:", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sahur-recipe-muslim-personalities-ramadan-meal-10214026"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 04:40PM", "tags": ["crime", "geylang"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Man jailed for leading police on 'action movie car chase' in Geylang ", "content": " SINGAPORE: A 57-year-old man was sentenced to jail on Tuesday (May 22) for leading the police on a car chase through the streets of Geylang in 2017. In the course of the chase on a Sunday morning, Chua Lim Teck had driven against the flow of traffic four times, hit three vehicles and drove through a closed gantry, before finally coming to a stop. Chua was sentenced to nine-and-a-half months' jail for committing three traffic offences, including one count of dangerous driving and driving without a valid licence, as well as one Customs-related offence. He was also barred from driving for three years. The court heard that Chua was pulled over by the police at Lorong 14 Geylang Road for a routine check at around 10.40am on Jul 16, 2017. He was accompanied by his wife in the vehicle, a red van, as seen in video footage played in court.  When Chua could not produce his particulars, the police officer instructed Chua’s wife to alight, and for Chua to move his vehicle to the side of the road for further checks. But instead of doing so, he continued to move forward and eventually sped off towards Guillemard Road. This sparked a “protracted pursuit” lasting about four minutes, said prosecutors, during which Chua drove through the small side streets in the Geylang area without regard for traffic rules. In his haste to get away, Chua collided with a taxi and two parked cars, but did not stop. He dashed through two stop signs and drove against the flow of traffic four times, before driving through a gantry at Guillemard Road, causing it to rip off. He also drove through a pedestrian crossing while someone was walking on it. Chua finally stopped his vehicle at a gantry at the entrance of Cassia Crescent. But even then, he attempted to escape on foot and “necessary force” had to be used to subdue and arrest him. He also claimed that he could not remember his NRIC number. A total of 180 cartons of contraband cigarettes were later found in his vehicle. It was also found that Chua did not possess a valid Class 3 driving licence. Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Yong noted that the chase occurred in a built-up area in the middle of a Sunday morning. “The potential harm for other road users was high, and there were plenty of families walking around,” he said. In sentencing, District Judge Mathew Joseph described the account of the incident as reading “like an action movie car chase that was fast and furious”. “This is quite astonishing for any motorist,” he said, adding that Chua had shown a “bold and blatant disregard” for the safety of other road users.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jailed-for-leading-police-on-action-movie-car-chase-in-10257234"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 04:07PM", "tags": ["Starbucks"], "author": "", "title": "Sit in Starbucks without buying a drink?

In response to Channel NewsAsia queries, Starbucks Asia said: \"In Singapore, we continue to review our practices to ensure we are creating a welcoming 'Third Place' for our customers and remain committed to delivering the authentic Starbucks experience.\" The company has a so-called \"Third Place\" policy, which aims to make its cafes \"a warm and welcoming environment where customers can gather and connect\" but it left it up to its staff to exercise their own judgment about non-paying guests. Last Saturday, Starbucks made clear to employees in the US that they are expected to allow anyone at its premises to use its facilities \"regardless of whether they make a purchase\" after the coffee chain was accused of discrimination. The change was triggered by a public outcry after two black men were arrested in mid-April at a Starbucks in Philadelphia while they were waiting for a third person for a business meeting. They asked to use the bathroom but were told they could not as they had not ordered anything, reports said. The video of the arrest, recorded by an onlooker, was posted on Twitter on Apr 13 and has since been viewed millions of times.  It sparked protests and a decision by Starbucks to close more than 8,000 stores on May 29 to conduct racial-bias training for employees.

The system, called the Next Generation Reporting Centre (NGRC), is the result of a collaboration between CNB and the Office of the Chief Science and Technology Officer at the Ministry of Home Affairs that began in August 2016. “It is the first-of-its-kind solution for urine reporting in the world … which aims to bring significant improvements to accuracy, capacity, durability, work productivity and hygiene,” CNB said on Tuesday (May 22). Urine reporting will also be more secure and accurate as human contact with the bottles are kept to a minimum, reducing the risk of tampering and contamination. In addition, the NGRC will bring manpower and time savings. The entire urine reporting workflow, which is done manually, currently takes 30 to 45 minutes on a normal day, CNB project manager Deputy Superintendent (DSP) Dinesh Kumar Rai said. With the NGRC's automation, the process will take about 30 minutes. As for manpower savings, DSP Dinesh said it is too premature to reveal figures as CNB is still conducting trials. THE WORKFLOW The NGRC comprises five modules: the appointment booking system, admin and register kiosk, authenticate and label kiosk, specimen handling platform and specimen sealing platform. The appointment booking system allows supervisees to book urine test appointments at the NRGC remotely via a URL. It also regulates the number of supervisees at the NGRC and accommodates walk-in and late cases. Supervisees refer to drug abusers who have been released but are still required to report for periodic urine testing. When a supervisee reports for testing, he will use a smart card and his fingerprint at the admin and register kiosk to get a queue number. The kiosk also allows supervisees to perform routine tasks like booking appointments, submitting medical certificates and updating personal particulars. Once his number is up, the supervisee will go to the authenticate and label kiosk to get his master urine bottle and test tube. After getting authenticated again, he will place the bottle and test tube into two slots that pop out of the kiosk. The kiosk automatically prints and labels the bottle and test tube, before the supervisee retrieves them and is escorted away to give his urine sample in the bottle. The supervisee then places the bottle and test tube in the specimen handling platform, which transfers some urine from the bottle to the test tube for drug analysis in CNB. If a urine sample is required for further testing at the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), the platform can also transfer urine from the master bottle into two other urine bottles. This platform is capable of capping and de-capping bottles, shaking them and ensuring they belong to the same person. The process is also recorded by an internal camera and archived. Finally, the specimen sealing platform automates the packing of bottles that will be sent to HSA for testing. This includes the e-signature of identification labels, tightening of bottle caps and heat shrink wrapping. OPTIMISE RESOURCES Speaking at CNB’s workplan seminar on Tuesday, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin said the NGRC is an example of how the bureau is using technology to improve work processes and optimise resources. “The urine procurement process today is cumbersome and manual,” he said. “Officers have to do the dirty task of handling urine samples, exposing them to health risks. It also takes officers away from doing other important work.” The trial will tentatively be conducted at the Human Performance Centre at the Home Team Academy and also in CNB's central division. CNB aims to operationalise the NGRC in all its enforcement divisions from 2020. “CNB has to adapt to the evolving operating landscape to remain relevant and effective,” its director Ng Ser Song said. “We must also ensure that we continue to engage the community and reinforce the zero-tolerance stance on drugs.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cnb-to-trial-computers-and-robots-urine-specimens-10257030"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 02:35PM", "tags": ["NDP2018", "National Day"], "author": "", "title": "National Day Parade ticket applications open on Wednesday", "content": " SINGAPORE: Ticket applications for this year’s National Day Parade (NDP) held at The Float @ Marina Bay will open from Wednesday (May 23) to Jun 3, the parade’s organising committee said on Tuesday.

A new prelude breathes fresh air into the song, originally written in 1987, and fashioned after a speech made by founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1966. Launching the theme, theme song, logo and concept of this year's NDP on Tuesday (May 22), chairman of the NDP 2018 Executive Committee Brigadier-General Alfred Fox said everyone loves the song. “It is an all-time favourite. You know the lyrics, I do. We sing it all the time. The school kids know it as well,” he said.  He was speaking at the launch event at the Marina Bay Floating Platform, which is where this year's NDP will be held. Lyricist, singer and composer Charlie Lim came up with the new prelude for the song after researching past National Day songs for a week and coming up with a demo. It was “scary” because the song is so iconic, Mr Lim said. When asked if people would like the song, he said: “I’m proud of it, I like it, it comes from an honest place. Hopefully, it resonates with other people.\"  His vocals in the original demo, recorded in his home,  were used in the video, as his performance was deemed more “heartfelt” than the one he tried to record in the studio.  The song was chosen in line with this year's theme bearing the same name.   “WE ARE SINGAPORE” THEME AND LOGO There were many ideas and variations in trying to represent “We are Singapore” as a logo, BG Fox said. A durian, an island and hearts were floated as options. After several iterations, a typographic logo was chosen for the first time, he said. The words are within a speech bubble embedded with a crescent and five stars.  BG Fox described the logo as “enduring” and said it follows the clear message of the theme.  “It is the voice of Singaporeans proudly proclaiming who we are as a people, as a country and that this is our home,” he said.   NAVAL COMBAT DIVERS TO JUMP FOR THE FIRST TIME Along with their counterparts from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Parachute Team, also known as the Red Lions, naval combat divers will be making a water jump, BG Fox said. The water jump is something they do as part of their job, he added.  A crowd favourite, this year’s aerial display and flypast promise to be spectacular, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). BG Fox also said that this year's military tattoo will be the biggest yet at the floating platform. The Combined Schools Choir will also return after five years.  As in previous years, the parade will be split into three segments: the pre-parade, the parade and ceremony, and the show.  Organised by 3rd Singapore Division, along with public and private sector agencies, the NDP this year will involve almost 14,000 participants, volunteers and personnel behind the scenes and on stage.  Singapore citizens and permanent residents can apply for tickets to the parade from Wednesday to Jun 3. \n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL DAY PARADE 2018 | Watch the parade live on channelnewsasia.com starting from 5.30pm on Aug 9.Our livestream is also available on twitter.com/channelnewsasia and facebook.com/channelnewsasia.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndp-2018-we-are-singapore-theme-song-floating-platform-10257002"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 01:27PM", "tags": ["road safety"], "author": "Elizabeth Neo", "title": "Speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles on trial until August", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three types of speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles are currently on trial until August, the Traffic Police (TP) announced on Tuesday (May 22) at the sixth edition of the Singapore Road Safety Month.  The event, which was focused on educating heavy vehicle drivers and motorcyclists, was kicked off by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health Amrin Amin at Republic Polytechnic. Speed limiters are currently mandated for certain heavy vehicles to curb speeding, but can be easily tampered with, TP said. The current trial aims to find a technology to complement or replace the speed limiters in heavy vehicles to effectively curb speeding. The three speed-tracking devices being trialed are the Digital Tachograph, the Enhanced Speed Limiter and the Fleet Management System. The devices are equipped with an audio buzzer, which will be activated when the heavy vehicle driver exceeds the speed limit. The devices are being tested on 30 vehicles. The Digital Tachograph will be able to automatically track and record the vehicle’s travelling speeds throughout the journey. Information recorded can be used for enforcement efforts for speeding. The Enhanced Speed Limiter and the Fleet Management System will employ GPS to calculate the travelling speed of the vehicle to prevent tampering of the speed limiter. It can also track the travelling speed of the vehicle throughout the journey. Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, chairman of the Singapore Road Safety Council Bernard Tay said he hopes better driving behaviour will come out of the initiative: “Hopefully this will reduce accidents and be safer for all road users.\" He added the focus this year is on commercial vehicle drivers, because they spend a lot of time on the road. “Heavy vehicles are bulky, there are a lot of blind spots and whenever there are accidents it can be fatal for victims. Motorcyclists can also be more vulnerable as they are not well protected.\"  The Traffic Police has partnered vehicle tracking firm Cartrack Technologies South East Asia for the trial, with three companies - Goldbell Group, Ley Choon Group and Koh Kock Leong Enterprise - on board.   The Traffic Police will study the accuracy and compatibility of these devices and with the heavy vehicles as well as their ability to resist tampering, after which it will consider implementation on heavy vehicles. In his speech, Mr Amrin said the launch of the speed-tracking devices installed on heavy vehicles “will enable companies to monitor the speed records of their drivers and take timely remedial action against those who speed\".  He noted commercial heavy vehicle drivers spend much of their time on the road and are more likely to be involved in accidents.  “Although the number of accidents involving heavy vehicles decreased by 13 per cent from 2016 to 2017, such accidents are more likely to result in fatalities. In 2017, three in 10 fatal accidents involved a heavy vehicle,\" he said. Motorcyclists are also not spared, Mr Amrin said: “While the number of fatal accidents involving motorcyclists decreased by 30 per cent in the same year, accidents involving motorcyclists made up more than half of all traffic accidents. Four in 10 fatal accidents involved a motorcycle.” At the event, the Traffic Police also unveiled two new educational videos to remind motorists to observe safe driving practices and stay vigilant on the road.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/speed-tracking-devices-for-heavy-vehicles-on-trial-until-august-10257020"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 01:03PM", "tags": ["GIC"], "author": "", "title": "GIC enters joint venture to acquire and develop office portfolio in California’s Playa Vista", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC has formed a joint venture with a group of investors to acquire a portfolio of Class A office assets in California’s Playa Vista, a district on the west side of Los Angeles.  According to a press release on Tuesday (May 22), the portfolio assets are Water’s Edge – a 259,000-sq-ft, two-building creative office campus in north-west Playa Vista – and a centrally-located 251,000-sq-ft, five-building multi-tenant complex called Playa Jefferson.  The joint venture, led by real estate investment management firm Rockwood Capital, has also commenced construction on the second phase of Water’s Edge, a 160,000-sq-ft office building which will be known as WE3.  Construction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020, after which, Water’s Edge will feature approximately 450,000 sq ft of Class A office space in a supply-constrained market, said the press release.  Mr Lee Kok Sun, GIC Real Estate’s chief investment officer said this investment reflects GIC’s long-term confidence in the West Los Angeles office market.  “We expect continued growth of the technology and creative media industries to benefit this dynamic national and international gateway.

The Flexi Plan also comes with 30 minutes of talk time and 10 SMS messages, and customers can choose to top up the data capacity - with S$8 for 1GB and S$12 for 2GB, the company said during a media briefing. Besides mobile data, subscribers can also add an extra 30 minutes' talk time with 10 free SMS messages for S$5, the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) said. “Technological evolution is reshaping the way businesses operate and the way people run their lives. That’s why we believe in empowering people by making digital access more available for everyone,” co-founder Rameez Ansar said in the press release. “For this reason, we released the Flexi Plan giving them access to the Internet with no strings attached.” The company added that it will continue offering the S$28 base plan for 6GB of data per month as well as the S$48 monthly plan for 26GB. Circles.Life’s latest offering comes a week after another MVNO, MyRepublic, entered the fray and offered two mobile plans to its existing customer base and those who supported its unsuccessful bid to be the country’s fourth telco. Its Uno plan similarly offers 1GB of mobile data, but at S$8 monthly. It comes with 1,000 minutes of talk time and 1,000 SMS messages, and the company also promised to eliminate \"bill shock\" by not charging users for exceeding the data limit. It is not just the virtual operators disrupting the local telecom landscape either. Australia-based telco, TPG Telecom, which is gearing up to be Singapore’s next full-fledged telco, intends to launch a plan targeting the elderly here. It said it plans to offer 3GB of monthly data and unlimited local calls at no charge for the first 24 months. GOING OFFLINE, QUICKER ACTIVATION Besides taking aim at Singaporeans’ large appetite for mobile data, Circles.Life is also tackling oftentimes expensive roaming charges. It is offering new pay-as-you-go roaming rates at 70 per cent of the current ones in 34 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Hong Kong, India and Australia. Essentially, this means it would cost S$3 per 100MB, the company said.  Circles.Life is also partnering SingPost to bring its mobile plans to brick-and-mortar outposts. Starting next week, customers can sign up for the plans via its kiosks at the General Post Office, Sengkang and Woodlands post offices, and this will be rolled out to other locations in future. The virtual operator touted a sign-up process of less than five minutes, and the SIM card can be collected on the spot. Activation will be done in less than an hour, it added. “The post office is an integral part of the neighbourhood, providing postal and other essential services to the community,” said SingPost's senior vice-president for group sales Sara Kalle. “We are pleased that Circles.Life has leveraged our islandwide network of post offices to make it more convenient for people to obtain digital access.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/circles-life-free-mobile-data-plan-singapore-10255154"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 10:40AM", "tags": ["Singapore", "HDB", "BTO", "housing"], "author": "", "title": "HDB launches almost 7,000 new flats in May sales exercise", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has launched 6,992 flats for sale under the May 2018 Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise, it said in a press release on Tuesday (May 22).

Private-hire car drivers are feeling the pinch too. Mr Muhammad Syahmi, 25, used to rake in between S$100 and S$200 a day as a private-hire car driver for Grab after deducting commission, petrol costs and rent, but his income has fallen by as much as 50 per cent — largely due to a reduction in incentives doled out by the ride-hailing firm. Recalling how he used to be able to take home a bonus of S$620 for completing 60 peak-hour trips, he said: That was the incentive for a good six, seven months last year but recently, completing the same amount of peak-hour trips would only give me an additional S$130. With his earnings taking a hit, being a full-time Grab driver is no longer an attractive proposition. He intends to stop driving soon and get another job. For five years, long-suffering commuters and taxi drivers in Singapore could hardly believe their luck as the taxi industry was turned on its head by ride-hailing firms. Commuters enjoyed low fares — sometimes rides were even free, thanks to generous promotions and discounts — and complaints of not being able to get a ride during rainy days or peak hours became a distant memory.  Droves of taxi drivers, as well as others, also flocked to Grab or Uber which offered flexible hours and attractive earnings as they duked it out and hired drivers aggressively in a bid to gain market share quickly.

READ: A commentary on the fresh thinking regulators need to tackle the Grab-Uber merger to keep services competitive. But it was too good to be true. On Mar 26, after months of speculation, Grab announced its acquisition of Uber's Southeast Asia operations, including in Singapore. FEELING HARD DONE BY The deal is under review by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), and as part of interim measures, the Uber app was kept in operation until May 7. Now, less than two weeks after Uber officially exited the Singapore market, commuters and drivers are feeling the impact. Make no mistake about it, the situation is still a far cry from circa 2013, when Grab and Uber made their first forays into Singapore.  \"There is no doubt that consumers are better off today. The market has expanded tremendously, rides are more available, passengers don't have to stand by the road, with the uncertainty of not getting a vehicle,\" said transport economist Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). However, the demise of competition — at least for the time being — and Grab's subsequent moves in light of its new-found dominance have left many feeling hard done by. \"I used to be able to drive whenever I want. I just had to clock the number of trips, but now I have no choice. I have to work during peak hours if I want to get the incentives,\" said a Grab driver who gave his name as Mr Sofian. According to him, Grab has stopped giving out incentives to drivers for completing a certain number of trips while still rewarding them for completing jobs during peak hours. COMMUTER WOES Several commuters interviewed said they were forking out about S$3 to S$5 more for each Grab ride these days, mainly because the firm no longer dishes out discounts and promotional codes like it used to. However, Grab has maintained that its fare structure \"remains the same\" after it bought out Uber's regional operations. In reply to queries about the commuters' experience with higher fares, a Grab spokesperson would only say that fares are determined by demand and supply. The spokesperson said: \"Dynamic fares continue to be calculated based on a base distance, with a dynamic surcharge that will be applied based on factors including demand and supply in that particular point in time, traffic conditions and estimated time taken for the journey.\" Speaking on the last day of Uber's operations in Singapore, Grab Singapore country head Lim Kell Jay confirmed that the promotional codes and incentives which Grab users previously enjoyed have made way for perks on its loyalty programme GrabRewards. These promotions had been \"trending down\" even before its acquisition of Uber's Southeast Asia operations, Mr Lim had said. Previously, commuters were offered limited discounts of about S$3 or more per ride by using promotional codes when making bookings. Now, they can redeem perks such as shopping gift cards and frequent flyer miles. Meanwhile, incentives for private-hire drivers have also been scaled back, as Grab looks at other ways to lower drivers' operating cost and maintain or increase their income. For example, the firm is working with fuel companies and fleet partners to offer cheaper petrol and rent. It is also looking at giving drivers \"more jobs within the same period of time\" to allow them to earn more, Mr Lim had said. Experts noted Grab is scaling back incentives and discounts in order to recoup its losses from the days of fierce competition for market share. \"Grab will continue experimenting and testing (the) limits, while the market is still rationalising,\" said Associate Professor Lawrence Loh of the National University of Singapore Business School. DRIVERS FEELING THE BRUNT Between commuters and private-hire drivers, it appears that the latter group is feeling the brunt of the firm's business manoeuvres. Drivers reported not only has the quantum of incentives gone down, the variety has also been cut. Grab does not publish a full list of its incentive policies. Incentive details \"are updated on a weekly basis\" and can be found on the driver's app, it said. Anecdotally, several drivers said they have noticed the extent of the reduction and the type of incentives offered seemed to differ between individual drivers. There should be greater transparency, they said. Previously, Mr Sofian said he used to be eligible for two types of drivers' incentives: A weekly total incentive, which is a lump sum for completing a certain number of trips, and a peak-hour incentive, which gives him an additional bonus only if he completes trips during peak hours. However, since the beginning of May, he was only offered the peak-hour incentive. It has not only resulted in his earnings falling by 30 per cent, but also meant that he could no longer enjoy flexible hours if he wanted to make ends meet. \"It's just not worth it, I am getting much less for the same number of hours put in,\" he said. Having driven for Grab for more than two years, he said he might stop driving if his income continues to fall. Another Grab driver, Ms Rennu Mahajan, 57, said the firm had replaced her weekly incentive with a monthly one since the second week of this month. Going forward, experts said drivers may have to contend with further tweaking of the incentives, as Grab experiments and tries to determine what is most cost-effective or how to better meet commuter demand. In other words, this would see Grab tweaking incentive schemes as it deems fit, and translate into the firm having greater control of its drivers. Said Dr Theseira: \"It is in Grab's interest to maximise a vehicle, because they earn off a driver's commission. So, if they observe that a driver is not utilising his vehicle during the peak hours, it might want to increase their availability rate during high-demand hours by changing their incentive scheme.\" He added: This is different from a cab company in that it doesn't really care when and how long you drive, so as long as you are able to afford rent. CHANCE FOR TAXI FIRMS TO 'GET BACK INTO THE GAME' Notwithstanding the CCCS' concerns over Grab's monopolistic powers in the private-hire car industry, experts believe the traditional taxi companies — which have been floundering since their business was massively disrupted — have a window of opportunity to get back into the game. Last month, traditional taxi operators were reporting a jump in the number of Uber drivers seeking to join or return to them. Subsequently, ComfortDelGro — the only taxi operator which has not partnered Grab — announced on May 7 that it is adding 200 new hybrid Hyundai Ioniqs to its taxi fleet. This would be the first addition to its fleet in almost 1.5 years, the company said. Just days later, the company placed a tender notice in the Straits Times for 500 more hybrid sedans. Meanwhile, analysts believe the worst might be over for ComfortDelGro, with the taxi industry \"turning the corner\", as Maybank Kim Eng put it in its latest research report on the firm. Maybank Kim Eng analyst John Cheong said: \"(ComfortDelGro's) management has turned more positive on the taxi segment as it's starting to see increased demand from drivers who switched from private-hire cars, as they find taxis relatively more stable.\" If Grab is concerned about recovering its expenses, then it is \"good news for the taxi industry\", said SUSS urban transport expert Park Byung Joon. \"The days when ride-hailing companies were bleeding through their noses are over, now the playing field for drivers is level,\" said Dr Park, noting that the incomes of private-hire car drivers were previously inflated due to the incentives dangled by ride-hailing firms. A STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM? Mr David Kwan, 51, is among the private-hire car drivers who have regretted making the switch from a traditional taxi operator.  Mr Kwan, who joined Grab earlier this month, said he used to take home about S$60 a day as a private-hire car driver for Uber. However, his income has fallen by as much as 30 per cent since Uber's operations in Singapore officially ceased. \"At this rate, there is no harm going back to driving a taxi,\" said Mr Kwan, who intends to go back to his old trade once his vehicle rental contract expires in July. Reflecting a drop in commuter demand, Mr Kwan said bookings have dropped. Last week, for example, he had to wait \"half an hour for one booking\". Now, he takes home between S$40 and S$45 a day. Mr Kwan said he used to make as much as about S$2,500 a month as a private-hire car driver, but he was unsure if his earnings as a taxi driver would \"still be as high\" when he rejoins a taxi operator. Still, driving a cab could mean a more stable income, he said. \"Plus, driving a taxi, sometimes you can get company bookings, I can also go to the airport and hotels to queue for passengers,\" he added. Assoc Prof Loh cautioned that if the trend of disgruntled drivers leaving were to continue, Grab's business would be hit:  They have to play their cards right, no monopoly is permanent. If they lose their drivers, they lose their business. As things stand, commuters are still better off today, compared to the days when only traditional taxi operators were around, the experts reiterated. The underlying pricing system adopted by ride-hailing companies such as Grab also makes more economic sense, they added. \"Surge pricing generates value, because those people who really want a vehicle badly are more or less guaranteed a vehicle if they are willing to pay the price for it. In the past, it was a matter of luck — whether your call or booking is picked up by a cab driver,\" said Dr Theseira. At the same time, the traditional taxi operators continue to provide an additional option for commuters. \"Sometimes when the surge prices are too high, I'll just call a cab,\" said Ms Cherie Loh, 25, a business efficiency associate. She noted that commuters like herself also use the taxis' metered fare as a benchmark. \"If the Grab price far exceeds the usual cab amount, I'll forgo the Grab ride. At the end of the day I'm still glad I have the option (of a) cab,\" she added. As for whether drivers would be better off working for traditional taxi operators or ride-hailing companies in the foreseeable future, Dr Theseira said it is hard to tell. It depends on a wide range of factors such as the hours spent on the road, the amount of flexibility that a driver wants, and various components of their earnings. \"Sometimes, even the model of vehicle that a driver chooses to rent could significantly affect his earnings,\" Dr Theseira noted. WITHOUT FINANCIAL MIGHT, NEW ENTRANTS 'CAN'T CHALLENGE GRAB' Despite the slew of new entrants into the private-hire car industry since the Grab-Uber deal, the experts believe none of them so far has the financial muscle to take on Grab — leaving Indonesia's Go-Jek, which is rumoured to be contemplating entering the Singapore market, as the only real contender. Ms Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Asian transport equity research firm Crucial Perspective, said the new players such as Ryde, Jugnoo and even blockchain application MVL, will not pose a significant challenge to Grab. Furthermore, Grab has enough capital to dangle lucrative incentives again, should it see the need to do so to stave off potential rivals. \"Grab would have anticipated new players after the Grab-Uber (deal) and is probably not too concerned, seeing as it's already well-established in Singapore and has a US$2.5 billion (S$3.36 billion) war chest,\" said Ms Png. Dr Theseira reiterated that the odds were stacked against the new entrants \"because they don't appear to have the capital to reach critical mass and provide that high-quality experience\". He added: Commuters and drivers are likely to try new apps a few times, and to return to Grab, or taxis if the new entrants can't provide a consistent and high-quality experience. Sriram Rengamannar, a 16-year-old student, is among the commuters who have tried the RydeX app. He noted that while its fares are generally higher than Grab's, the discounts offered by RydeX offset the difference. A trip from his home in central Singapore to his school in the Alexandra area would cost him about S$7 on Grab, but would be priced at S$12 on RydeX. \"For now, I would take Ryde as they offer between 30 and 50 per cent cash back,\" said Sriram, although he noted that RydeX only takes advance bookings. THE ROAD AHEAD As the CCCS continues to ponder over the deal, it seems that Grab is likely to remain the biggest player in the ride-hailing market in the near term. \"In fact, Grab is probably hoping that the presence of these new entrants will convince the CCCS to stop its investigation,\" Ms Png said. The CCCS has not indicated a timeline for its decision on the Grab-Uber deal. Assoc Prof Loh felt it was unlikely that the competition watchdog would introduce another set of interim measures, and might wait for the market to rationalise on its own. \"If Grab continues its monopolistic ways and continues to increase prices, consumers can simply choose to go for alternatives and that will pressure Grab to keep their prices affordable,\" said Assoc Prof Loh. With the Land Transport Authority (LTA) reviewing its regulatory regime for the taxi and private-hire car industries, Dr Theseira noted that the need for the CCCS to step in may be overtaken by events. \"If LTA develops a set of regulations that also account for competition concerns, it will supersede the need for the CCCS to make specific rules on regulating competition in ride hailing. There may also be no need to provide a ruling if there is an entry from a credible, well-financed player, such as Go-Jek,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-uber-grab-hits-commuters-drivers-hard-no-incentives-promos-10253762"}, {"datetime": "22 May 2018 12:25AM", "tags": [], "author": "Kamini Devadass", "title": "Singapore to implement e-invoice framework based on Europe’s PEPPOL", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore will become the first Asian country to implement an electronic invoicing standard based on a similar process used in Europe.

In addition, this will help our companies transact internationally, with businesses from many other countries that are also in the PEPPOL network,” said Mr Iswaran. \"We carefully reviewed the various e-invoicing standards around the world, including the option of whether we should design our own Singapore standard, (but) we decided the best way forward that would help companies plug into international global marketplace is adopting a global standard, and PEPPOL has a proper standard,\" said IMDA Chief Executive Tan Kiat How. IMDA will be working with government agencies, trade associations and chambers such as Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Business Federation to implement the e-invoicing standard, and collectively drive adoption of a common framework for businesses. Over 40 companies have expressed interest to be part of the e-invoicing system. They include Sheng Siong Group, StarHub and United Overseas Bank. “We will also work with our customers, including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in their adoption of e-invoicing so that they can improve their cash flow management, productivity and see greater connectivity across their supply chain,\" said Mr Mervyn Koh, Managing Director and Country Head of Business Banking Singapore, United Overseas Bank. The push for e-invoicing is part of efforts to help companies go digital but recognising that this can be daunting, authorities say they are ramping up measures to help them. These include enhancing the SMEs Go Digital programme with the introduction of an initiative called Digital Project Management Services, where professionals, managers and executives will be trained to be in-house digital project consultants to help small- and medium-sized companies execute their digital plans. There is also the Open Innovation Platform - a virtual crowd-sourcing platform that will match solution providers with firms that are facing challenges in their business. The platform will be launched in June.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-to-implement-e-invoice-framework-based-on-europe-s-10255456"}, {"datetime": "21 May 2018 11:57PM", "tags": ["Bukit Panjang", "Punggol", "Singapore Post", "IMDA"], "author": "Kamini Devadass", "title": "Common parcel locker system to be piloted in Bukit Panjang, Punggol in October", "content": " SINGAPORE: A one-year nationwide common parcel locker system will be piloted in Bukit Panjang and Punggol in October, in a move that will allow residents at these two estates to pick up their packages from multiple collection points around-the-clock. The lockers will be located within 250m of HDB residential blocks, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) announced on Monday (May 21). Bukit Panjang will have 23 locker sites, which will be run by logistics provider Blu Logistics. Punggol will have 39 locker sites, run by Singapore Post . The locker stations will also be available at eight MRT stations: Bukit Panjang, Chinese Garden, Lakeside, Boon Lay, Punggol, Sengkang, Buangkok and Hougang. \"In terms of educating the consumer, we intend to provide flyers, promotional, educational materials to the consumer, to the HDB resident,” said Mr Freddy Chang, Head of SP Parcels, a subsidiary of Singapore Post.

The locker stations will be available around-the-clock, and customers will require certain information, such as a Collection PIN sent via SMS, in order to access their parcels. The common parcel locker system also provides greater efficiency and cost savings for retailers and logistics service providers, who will only need to deliver to a single locker station instead of individual homes. The Federated Lockers and Collection Points will be overseen by IMDA. First announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in April 2016, the common delivery network is an initiative to accelerate transformation for the logistics industry. It aims to complement the rapid growth in Singapore’s e-commerce market, which is estimated to be worth S$7.5 billion in 2027. Fifteen major logistics industry players, online merchants and marketplaces have signed a Memorandum of Intent with IMDA to use the common parcel system.

Singaporeans must have a global mindset and global skillsets in order to understand how these changes will affect Singapore and the type of opportunities they bring. “The global mindset refers to the way we look at the rest of the outside world. How we can value add to them, what are their interests, what are their institutions, who are the individuals that can shape the global environment,\" said Mr Chan.  \"We must have a deep understanding of how all these forces interact in order for us to be able to meaningfully make a contribution to the world.” As for skillsets, Mr Chan said, Singaporeans must be able to work outside the country in order to tap the opportunities that emerging economies can provide.  “That is a way for us to transcend our constraints as a small country, whereby we seize opportunities not just in Singapore but also beyond Singapore,” he added. Mr Chan also said that everyone will have a chance to write the next chapter of the Singapore story - including those who have close ties with the country. Touching on issues such as social mobility and inequality, which were raised during the debate on the President's Address in Parliament last week, Mr Chan said that Singapore defines its success by how well the next generation does. “While we may be small in terms of our population, in terms of the size of our country, we cannot be small in terms of our ambition and drive. \"And if we - this current generation and future generation of Singaporeans - can continue to have the same kind of drive, the same kind of ambition as our pioneer generation, then there is absolutely nothing to say that we cannot achieve even more than what our pioneer generations achieved for us,” said Mr Chan. “We don't define success just for this generation alone, we define our success by how able we are to allow the next generation to do even better than us.

Among the list of his offences include rioting, voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon, unlawful possession of weapons and driving without a licence, court documents show. Pong Jia Rong Kenji pleaded guilty on Monday (May 21) to nine charges. Another 10 similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.  He was also disqualified from holding a driving licence for 12 months. The court heard that on one occasion, Pong and his group – which included at least 10 people – had set upon another, smaller group in the early hours of Sep 1, 2016 in the vicinity of St James Power Station. Prior to the attack, Pong’s group had asked one of the victims, 22-year-old Capone Valerio Nicodemo, which gang he belonged to, but the victim replied that it was none of their concern. During the attack, another victim, 22-year-old Ng Tai Rong, was also punched, kicked and hit with a traffic cone by the group. Pong also attempted to use a taser on Mr Ng, who managed to dodge in time. The group started to disperse after they noticed Mr Ng had fallen to the ground, bleeding. By the time the police arrived, Pong had fled the scene. On another occasion, Pong and another group attacked 19-year-old Ngiam Hai Jun Eugene along Cuscaden Road on May 7, 2017. Court documents did not indicate the reason behind the attack. In a bid to stop the assault, an eyewitness shouted that the police were coming. When Pong and his group showed no signs of stopping the assault, the eyewitness took her phone out and began taking a video of the incident. Seeing this, Pong went to her and told her to stop taking the video. He also shoved her. Another member of his group also came towards her and punched her repeatedly. During the incident, two other eyewitnesses were also attacked: One for also trying to take a video, and the other for trying to call the police. By the time the police arrived, Pong had fled. He was eventually arrested on May 19, 2017. While out on bail, Pong attacked another victim at St James Power Station with an extendable baton, causing the man to bleed from his head, court documents show. Pong had also been caught with weapons including a stun device and a knuckleduster on separate occasions. Two packets of methamphetamine were also found in Pong’s home.

While en route to his parents’ home, the 28-year-old Singaporean lost control of his car and hit a pedestrian. The pedestrian, Ms Serene Ng, 41, was taken to the hospital in a critical condition and died of her injuries that same day. On Monday (May 21), Galistan was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment and disqualified for driving for five years. He was convicted of causing death by a negligent act earlier this month. According to court documents, Galistan had been driving along Jurong West St 42 the morning of Aug 25, 2017, when he abruptly lost control of his car, mounted the kerb and hit Ms Ng, who had just crossed the road. Investigations revealed that the night before the accident, Galistan had gone out with friends and stayed up all night, before going to a coffee shop near his friend’s house in Seletar for breakfast at about 6.45am. After breakfast, he drove his friends back to their houses at Seletar and Stevens Road, before driving back to his parents’ home. Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy stressed that Galistan had driven for a “considerable distance and time” while sleep deprived, and had thereby endangered the lives of other road users, including his friends to whom he had given a lift. He also described the incident as “not an ordinary case of negligence on the road”, noting that Ms Ng had already finished crossing the road, and had been on the kerb when the accident occurred. “This was an entirely preventable tragedy, and the needless loss of a life,” he said.  Galistan, who had asked to address the court, apologised for his actions.  But Ms Ng’s older brother, Ng Chin Khoon, felt that the sentence Galistan received was too light. Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom, he said that Galistan should have been disqualified from driving for life.​​​​​​​ Describing his sister as “friendly and helpful”, he said that Ms Ng, who was a civil servant, had taken leave from work the day of the accident to do social work. “I still cannot accept (this),” he said. “She was a careful person.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sleep-deprived-driver-who-caused-death-of-pedestrian-jailed-3-10253696"}, {"datetime": "21 May 2018 12:30PM", "tags": ["Home Team", "Singapore police", "K Shanmugam"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Home Team launches simulation centre to train commanders in handling large-scale emergencies", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new Home Team Simulation Centre that trains commanders in incident management and operational decision-making was launched by Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam on Monday (May 21). The centre houses a system that simulates emergency and crisis scenarios in a mock command centre through 3D representations of real scenarios. “The simulation will get the officers in-sync, and give them a hands-on feel as well as a relevance of command skills,” said Mr Shanmugam at the Home Team Academy (HTA) workplan seminar. “We will aim to strengthen the Home Team integration based on common values and a shared mission, and the academy has a key role in that,” he added. He first talked about the simulator at last year's HTA workplan seminar, when it was being conceptualised. Benefits of the simulator include manpower savings and increased training frequency, as it can mirror logistically intensive large-scale training exercises that come with deployment constraints. The simulator can create 15 different scenarios while introducing new elements to make exercises realistic and unpredictable. These include variables like bombs and protestors, aimed at placing commanders under stress. The scenarios also evolve based on commanders’ decisions. One scenario is a chemical agent attack during year-end celebrations at Orchard Road, complete with bombs and protestors. “New scenarios can be added to prepare Home Team commanders for new and evolving emergencies and security threats,” the Home Team said. The simulator currently focuses on four locations: Bishan, Little India, Marina Bay Sands and Orchard Road, with future plans to include other areas. MOBILE APPLICATION Staying with the theme of integration and consistency in training, Mr Shanmugam said HTA will roll out a mobile application that lets officers access e-learning courseware on the go. The content in the app is customised for sharing across the HTDs, which ensures greater consistency of learning. “Currently, Home Team officers access e-learning through the Home Team Learning Management System (HTLMS) using their office desktops,” Home Team said. “As most frontline officers are often required to perform operational duties away from their desks, officers found it challenging to find time to access the HTLMS.” Officers can use the app for greater accessibility and to learn at a more comfortable pace. The app caters to different learning needs by incorporating images, videos, podcasts and quizzes. In addition, the app improves learning by giving officers a headstart even before they enter formal training classes. HTA has started Proof-of-Concept trials with all HTDs by developing e-learning courseware on mobile learning applications. TRAINING ON THE GO HTA is also piloting a Training-on-the-Go (TANGO) system that allows any location to be turned into a classroom, giving frontline officers more flexibility in their training. TANGO comprises three components: Virtual Classroom Management System (VCMS), Vertical-MINI and Webinar.  The VCMS is equipped with instant messaging and screen sharing to allow officers to collaborate and exchange knowledge, while Vertical-MINI can transform any surface into an interactive board for classroom training. Webinar allows presentations to be conducted over the Internet, enabling officers in different locations to participate remotely. The Home Team School of Criminal Investigation and the Home Team Behavioural Sciences Unit is currently trying out TANGO. CROSS-CUTTING SKILLS Beyond tighter integration among the Home Team units, Mr Shanmugam stressed the need to develop the officers through continuous skills and academic upgrading. To that end, Mr Shanmugam said HTA is working with SkillsFuture Singapore and institutes of higher learning to train officers in tradecraft and cross-cutting skills. Tradecraft skills include investigation skills and emergency medical services, while cross-cutting skills include data analytics and cybersecurity. Officers will take relevant courses depending on their job requirements at different points in their career. “As long as our officers are willing to put in the effort, we will support you on this journey (to) get better skills, capabilities,” Mr Shanmugam said. DEGREE CREDITS In terms of academics, HTA is working with the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) to accredit its courses and allow officers to earn up to 40 SUSS degree credits upon completing the courses as part of their training. The credits can be accumulated towards a Certificate in Home Team Studies conferred by SUSS, which is slated to be rolled out from January 2020. These credits can also count towards SUSS degree requirements. “We will seek to roll out more of such courses or credits so that our officers can work towards a degree,” Mr Shanmugam said. “We will try to open up the pathway as much as possible, for as many officers as possible.” FOUNDATION COURSE In addition, HTA has launched a new Home Team foundation course for all senior uniformed and civilian officers. The course, a two-week residential programme, aims to foster a strong identity among Home Team officers through shared experiences, experiential elements and learning visits, Home Team said. The course aims to “build strong bonds across the Home Team, with a common understanding of our heritage and culture”, Mr Shanmugam said.

Window blinds were shut, playgrounds were deserted. The police didn’t know where to start. The breakthrough came when the police used a technology capable of analysing ten years’ worth of crime records - or two million files - and cross-referencing these with tips submitted by citizens.  By using this unique technology at the time, they finally identified the killer, putting an end to this high-profile crime case which lasted more than a year. Thanks to the power of data, the police were able to keep communities safe. We can extend this scenario to other aspects of life. In hospitals, doctors analyse patient data to fight chronic diseases and provide better treatment. In disaster areas, charities – like Feed the Children – use data analysis to better distribute more than 100 million pounds of food to those in need. Yet, these \"data knights\" in shining armour don’t come to the rescue as often as we need them to. Our recent Data Literacy survey in March 2018, where we interviewed more than 5,000 full time workers across Australia, Singapore, India, China and Japan, found that almost nine out of ten workers in Singapore aren’t data literate – or confident in their ability to read, understand, work with and challenge data.  This number is higher than the Asia-Pacific average, where four out of five employees struggle to deal with data at the workplace. MORE TO BE DONE TO MAKE SINGAPOREANS DATA LITERATE The reality is – we all need to act in concert if we want to change this situation for the better. Championing data literacy should not be the work of just one single entity—everyone from all walks of life must be involved, be it individuals, the public or private sector. And we can’t start too early. That’s why I welcome initiatives like the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA)’s Data-Driven Innovation Challenge, for instance, where students were tasked to develop data-driven solutions that impact everyday lives. It’s a great platform to promote data literacy among young minds. Nanyang Technological University in Singapore has also introduced an innovative undergraduate degree programme in data science and artificial intelligence this year to prepare students for the new digital economy. However, it will take time for these programmes to bear fruit – our Data Literacy survey also shows that 89 per cent of graduate-level employees in Singapore currently don’t see themselves as being prepared to deal with data at the workplace, worrying considering the amount of data they will have to deal with as soon as they start their first jobs. This is why Singapore will have to play a bigger role in championing greater data literacy for the benefit of its citizens. The Government’s SkillsFuture for the Digital Workplace scheme is the largest national training effort focusing on instilling digital skills, which includes the ability to use, create and share digital content responsibly.  But the underlying factor is data literacy itself. Because at the end of the day, how far can one go with digital literacy, if they don’t know how to make sense of the data they are exposed to in the first place? READ: A commentary on what tech education today for a digital workforce tomorrow looks like. READ: A commentary on how do we know when we've become a Smart Nation? To help society become more confident with data, organisations need to come up with learning programmes with certifications that are comprehensive yet easily accessible and affordable for everyone.  A culture change is key when it comes to improving data literacy within organisations, so the development of soft skills also needs to be embedded and emphasised clearly in these programmes. DECISION-MAKING BELONGS TO HUMANS, NOT MACHINES As data continues to permeate every aspect of our lives - at home, work or school - the potential of putting it to good use seems endless.  And while the technology for collecting and analysing said data will become more widespread, there is one thing that remains, which can’t be automated: Our human ability to instil sense into what we see on our screens. Starting today, we should ask more questions. Interrogate the facts and numbers that we are provided with. We must be more curious and ask ourselves what the next steps are; how can we benefit from this information? In what way can it change our lives?  Going back to the Swedish town of Malmo - technology might have helped to speed up the analysis of criminal records which would have taken one officer 43 years to complete, but ultimately it was the police officer behind the machine who made sense of the data and tracked down the serial killer. There was a time when reading and writing skills were exclusive to scholars and the learned community. Just as these skills moved beyond scholars, data literacy will become an important and common skill, and those without it will be limited in what they can accomplish.

Through its Gravitrap surveillance system, NEA said it found that the mosquito population remained high with 22 per cent more Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the first quarter of this year compared to the previous quarter, thus posing a risk of an increase in dengue cases. Earlier this month, three people died and 60 dengue cases were reported in a dengue cluster at Jurong West. \"The warmer months of June to October usually see higher transmission of dengue in Singapore, due to accelerated breeding and maturation cycles of the Aedes mosquitoes and shorter incubation periods for the dengue virus.  \"NEA is thus expecting an increasing trend in cases in the warmer months ahead if we do not take steps to keep the mosquito population in check,\" the media release said. The agency urged members of the public to continue to work together as a community to stem dengue transmission. \"NEA, together with the various agencies and other stakeholders represented in the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force (IADTF), including Town Councils, have stepped up checks leading up to the traditional peak dengue season to rid our public areas and housing estates of potential mosquito breeding habitats,\" added NEA. From January to March 2018, NEA conducted about 265,000 inspections, including 2,400 inspections carried out at construction sites, the agency said, adding that it uncovered about 4,200 instances of mosquito breeding habitats. Speaking at the main launch of the 2018 National Dengue Prevention Campaign at the North East District on Sunday, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Masagos Zulkifli urged all members of the public and stakeholders to stay vigilant and not let their guard down even though the dengue cases this year are fewer than in recent years. He made the call for a concerted effort to suppress the Aedes mosquito population and keep dengue incidence low in the run up to the peak dengue season. PROJECT WOLBACHIA Meanwhile, NEA said Phase 2 of the Project Wolbachia study has also begun. The study is being conducted at the same Phase 1 sites (Tampines West and Nee Soon East) and their extended areas, the agency added. The project involves the use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to suppress the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in Singapore. So far, the study has provided \"valuable ecological information\" on the behaviour of mosquitoes in Singapore, NEA said. The Phase 2 study is expected to build on that and improve the release methodologies in Singapore's high-rise and high-density urban environment, the release added. \"While NEA explores the potential of Wolbachia technology, source eradication of mosquito breeding habitats and spraying of insecticides where necessary to control the adult mosquito population, will continue to be our key strategy for dengue prevention in Singapore.\" The dengue prevention campaign launch will be followed by island-wide outreach efforts across the five districts at different constituencies, NEA said. This campaign will be supported by the local grassroots advisers and the community, with the mobilisation of grassroots leaders and Dengue Prevention Volunteers (DPVs). They will conduct patrols to check for potential breeding habitats in common areas around their neighbourhoods and house visits to advise residents on common mosquito breeding habitats and to share dengue prevention tips, the release said. The campaign this year will focus on making residents aware that clean and stagnant water in their homes can be potential breeding habitats for mosquitoes, it added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dengue-mosquitoes-nea-cases-expected-in-warmer-months-10251670"}, {"datetime": "20 May 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["Taxi", "Grab", "Uber"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "New taxi orders, return of drivers: Are cab operators getting back on track?", "content": " SINGAPORE: When his contract with ride-hailing giant Grab ends in a month’s time, Mr Gregory Lim intends to give up his Mazda 3 for a Prius Hybrid taxi from SMRT – reversing a move he made last year.  Experiences of waiting for an assigned booking and getting cancellations after spending time travelling to a location have made the former taxi driver miss the days of being able to pick up passengers off the streets.  The 41-year-old also lamented that he no longer has the drive to clock long hours on the road amid shrinking cash incentives.  “After Uber is gone, so are the incentives,” Mr Lim said, referring to Grab’s landmark deal to acquire the Southeast Asia operations of its American rival. “Becoming a private-hire car driver was all about the incentives.”  Also mulling a return to the taxi industry is former ComfortDelGro cabby Sabastian, who cited taxes as his main consideration.  The driver, who preferred to be known by his first name, said monthly expenses, such as vehicle rental and petrol, can amount to S$2,500 or more. But unlike cabbies, these are non-tax-deductible for private-hire car drivers.  “Don’t forget that Grab takes a 20 per cent commission so after these deductions, I’m not left with much to take home,” said the sole breadwinner. “Tax is a problem not just for me, but many drivers too. That’s why we are thinking of going back to taxis.”  In recent years, traditional cab operators in Singapore have taken a hit with ride-hailing services hot on its wheels. Apart from passengers, it also witnessed an exodus of driver-hirers which at one point in time, left fleets of taxis lying idle in yards.  But with the change in hearts among some drivers, at least one taxi company is benefiting.  Industry leader ComfortDelGro announced earlier this month that it has placed an order for 200 new cabs – its first in close to one-and-a-half years.  This was meant for the “uptick” in demand for its taxis over the last month or so, said company spokesperson Tammy Tan. The taxi giant signed on close to 300 new hirers in April – nearly double the same period last year.  Channel NewsAsia reached out to the other taxi operators with queries on whether they are noticing the same trend, but they did not respond or declined to comment.  On why some private-hire car drivers are changing tracks, transport analysts cited the rollback in monetary rewards as a key factor.  Previously, incentives as much as S$2,500 a month were achievable, according to drivers that Channel NewsAsia spoke to. These days, that has been halved.  “If I’m a driver, I will naturally sign up with the company that can give me the highest income,” said Dr Lee Der Horng from the National University of Singapore (NUS). “But just like promo codes, these upfront incentives were unsustainable. Now things have changed, drivers are feeling concerned.”  Echoing that, Dr Park Byung Joon from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) said perks, which included hefty bonus rewards and vehicle rental for as low as S$60 a day, have been “distractions” for many taxi drivers. “But when the time comes for no more incentives, they will start thinking which is more economically viable,” he said, while adding that taxi operators provide benefits such as maintenance support.  With “things back to how they are supposed to be”, Dr Park reckoned that there will soon be “a balance” between those behind the wheels of taxis and private-hire cars.  When contacted, a Grab spokesperson said: “Be it private-hire cars or taxis, drivers can choose their preferred services based on their lifestyle needs and preferences.\"  As a technology company, its role is to provide a platform for drivers, merchants and other partners, while using \"technology to enhance the overall efficiency of the transport system\". It is also “focused on bringing down the everyday costs” for drivers and has provided greater welfare support, such as discounts on fuel and mobile plans, added the spokesperson. IS THE WORST OVER FOR TAXIS? With the recent developments, industry experts said the taxi industry could see smoother roads ahead. Dr Park, for one, said cab operators can “finally breathe a bit easier”, thanks to the Grab-Uber deal. “Uber and Grab burning cash to buy market share had been a painful time for the local taxi companies. But the deal means that Grab will no longer need to do that – promo codes and big incentives, those days are over,” he said. “This will be a huge relief for not just ComfortDelGro, but all taxi operators.” Phillip Capital Research investment analyst Richard Leow went as far to say that the battered industry’s worst days may have passed. He noted that the consolidation of the two ride-hailing giants has led to “pricing rationalisation, in turn resulting in some flow of drivers back to taxis”. More importantly, ComfortDelGro’s move to grow its fleet again is the “big U-turn” that may signal “the worst could be over”. True enough, the biggest taxi operator in Singapore struck an upbeat note in its earnings report last week despite a near 20 per cent fall in first-quarter net profit. \"Revenue from the taxi business is expected to stabilise with the rationalisation of the competition landscape in Singapore,” said ComfortDelGro Group CEO Yang Ban Seng, while adding that there will be a more level playing field ahead.  Even with a host of new upstarts jostling to fill in Uber’s void, analysts said it may take some time before competition can be revved up again.  This is because new players, such as Ryde and Jugnoo, have only launched their services this month and remain in the early stages of building up a sizable fleet, said Dr Lee.  Earlier reports have suggested that homegrown firm Ryde started off with about 5,000 drivers, while Jugnoo signed up 100 and is hoping to hit a target of 2,000 by the end of the month.  The relatively smaller capital backing that these new disruptors have also seems to suggest that they may opt out of the “expensive strategy” of doling out incentives to attract drivers, said Dr Park. “But if they don’t intend to do the same as what Grab and Uber did, then I don’t think it’s going to be easy for them to build up their network quickly,” he added.  Still, this does not mean that the taxi fleet in Singapore could halt the brakes on recent declines. Statistics from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) showed the overall number of cabs plying the streets fell to 21,746 in March - its lowest in more than a decade.  While there could be a recovery in a few months, Dr Park thinks it will be unlikely for the taxi population figure to return to its heydays in 2014, when there were more than 28,000 taxis on the roads.  Cab operators also need to stay vigilant and continue to improve their business models by doubling down on innovation or take the opportunity to optimise their fleet, said Dr Lee.  In the case of ComfortDelGro, it will likely need to have a presence in the private-hire car space if it wants to have an even smoother recovery, according to RHB Research analyst Shekhar Jaiswal.  When contacted, the taxi operator declined to comment on updates for its joint venture with Uber on the acquisition of a stake in Lion City Holdings. Meanwhile, recent reports also suggested that ComfortDelGro has perhaps turned its attention to Indonesian ride-hailing service Go-Jek.  \"We await the final outcome of ComfortDelGro’s deal with Uber … and the Group’s definitive strategy to expand into private hire car business,” Mr Jaiswal said in a note. “We believe (it) needs to finalise a definitive strategy for private hire car business soon.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/new-taxi-orders-return-of-drivers-are-cab-operators-getting-back-10245958"}, {"datetime": "20 May 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["Progressive wage model", "social responsibility", "healthserve", "inequality", "humanity", "capitalism"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Commentary: Amid concerns over dollars and cents, is there no room for social responsibility?", "content": " SINGAPORE: In the past week, several MPs and Ministers have risen to address the issue of inequality in Singapore. It is clearly something that Singaporeans feel passionately about, judging by comments on social media platforms. This is partly because even for those of us who belong to the broad middle-class, the high cost of living coupled with our expectations of what a good life is, is a strain. Amid these concerns, one group that remains relatively quiet is workers at and below the 20th percentile. Labour Member of Parliament Zainal Sapari who has been raising the plight of these workers for many years now, has referred to them as the “voiceless”. READ: Zainal Sapari's commentary on 'slavery of the poor'. Many are not in a position to bargain or complain because they might lack skills and have very few employment options. One could then say that it’s really up to them to acquire skills and increase their options. Certainly, that should be one of the goals. However, considering that blue-collar manpower is still a need and many of these workers perform valuable jobs such as cleaning our estates and offices, or work as security guards in the places we play and work at, there is a need to ensure that Singaporeans who choose these options are not shortchanged. Mr Zainal is a proponent of the Progressive Wage Model, a productivity-based wage progression pathway that helps to increase wages of workers through upgrading their skills and improving their productivity. It’s mandatory for workers providing mostly outsourced services in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors. As a result of this scheme, the wages and skills of thousands of low-income workers have improved over the years. The skills improvements no doubt are also aimed at engendering pride in their professions and to give workers a sense of career progression. In terms of salaries, since 2012, the wages of workers at the 20th percentile have seen the largest increase. However, Mr Zainal feels more needs to be done as, even today, outsourced workers could see their salaries stagnate during their contractual service which can last more than two years. Even if they do get a raise, this could be reset once the contract ends and a new one begins, and this often has to do with businesses having to lower the prices of their services in order to win contracts. While acknowledging the improvements, Mr Zainal who, in the past, has even called out government agencies on cheap sourcing practices, said “we cannot expect to get better results if we keep on doing the same things”. IS THERE ROOM FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? Importantly, Mr Zainal said that companies should live up to a sense of social responsibility by being fair and treating their employees, especially rank-and-file workers, better. Businesses often say it is a challenge to operate in a high-cost environment like Singapore. Even labour costs seem relatively high considering the relatively low prices of certain goods and services. We would do well to consider if all these difficulties are leading to capitalist exploitation that seems to have become acceptable and even expected. If so, should we really accept this state of affairs as an inevitability? Are we uncomfortable enough with the inherent injustice to rethink the ways we consume goods and services and conduct business? Amid the concerns over dollars and cents, is there any room for a sense of social responsibility? DOES IT START WITH THE CONSUMER? With the Progressive Wage Model, some businesses are reporting desirable effects – higher productivity leads to improved profits for businesses and better wages for workers. Service buyers also experience better standards and quality. It looks like a virtuous cycle but what does it take to make it work? Dr Goh Wei Leong co-founder of HealthServe, a healthcare charity for migrant workers, in a recent edition of On the Record pointed out that it often starts with the consumer. You can’t blame the poor employers. They are really responding to a much deep-seated cultural framework we have here. “Many of us notice the poor treatment of the people doing menial work, cleaners or construction workers, be it Singaporeans or non-Singaporeans, when we say: ‘Let’s give them more pay. Let’s look into equity.’ While we are shouting out loud, advocating for them, are we ourselves willing to fork out a little more for cleaning services? Pay more for our buildings? Pay more for our conservancy, our monthly cleaning. We need to make that sacrifice. I think if all of us sacrifice a bit, it would make such a difference to the poor,” he said. He explained that for some small businesses, even paying for the medical treatment of one migrant worker could bankrupt them as they are not able to afford adequate insurance. Statements that call for consumers to pay more often provoke the ire of Singaporeans who feel they are already stretched thin by the high cost of living in Singapore. Any mitigation to the cost of living would certainly be welcomed, but considering the circumstances we live in today, taking a step back and considering how fulfilling our needs and wants could impact others in society is warranted.   Some point out that more expensive goods and services may also end up hurting the very group of workers they are meant to help. This is why there needs to be careful calibration and tiers of services and goods. Redistribution efforts might still remain necessary but hopefully to a lesser degree. UNETHICAL BUSINESSES There is another dimension to this in that businesses could be charging more for products and services without passing on the profits to their workers. Dr Goh maintains that consumers can play a role in influencing businesses in this case as well. “If consumers are able to demand ethical recruitment, ethical products, businesses would be forced to be ethical. If I demand that the businessman pay fair wages, then I must be willing to not patronise his establishment if he’s found not to have ethical practices. The consumers themselves have a lot of influence and I think we have to exercise that influence for good,” he said. As a start though, some have suggested financial incentives for businesses that are able to show ethical treatment of workers. Dr Goh suggested tax breaks. Mr Zainal mentioned introducing new policies that focus on encouraging and incentivising companies to have a good work culture. Studies have shown that a positive work culture can have tremendous benefits for businesses. Engendering such a work culture, no doubt, involves fair treatment and pay. It is in all our interests to see businesses and the economy thrive. After all, if they didn’t, the natural consequence would be high levels of unemployment. But is there a balance that can be struck to ensure that while businesses thrive, those working for them do too? Some feel that our focus on efficiency often derails such efforts, which may only see results in the medium to long-term. Dr Goh said it best in our interview:   Efficiency is getting from point A to point B, cheapest, fastest. But we should focus on being efficacious instead. This means that we take a longer route to get there but we are more human.  For example, we have better work conditions, workers are treated well, employers are happy. At the end, you may have some tradeoffs – spending more money, taking more time, building relationships, having to learn how to live in shared spaces, learning how to share. But I think it’s more efficacious. BEYOND DOLLARS AND CENTS Many would say it is natural in a capitalist society for money to be the measure of everything. But instead of using this as justification to pay certain workers low wages, perhaps we need to step back to fairly measure the true value of the work that they do, taking into account productivity efforts and professionalism. How does their work contribute to our well-being as individuals and as a nation? How much is it worth in dollars and cents? Indeed, they should not be seen as charities we have to contribute to, but if we thought about this more deeply, I imagine many of us would admit it is certainly more than what many of these workers get paid today. Let us not forget that capitalist societies also obviously constitute human beings, so we should think about how humanity fits into this equation. Can we, while fighting for progression, dignity and fairness for ourselves, do the same for others in our midst? Can we find it in ourselves to make the necessary adjustments to our demands and expectations in order to ensure progression, dignity and fairness for them, both in terms of the meaningfulness of their capabilities and the services they provide, and how they are compensated for these efforts? As government, consumers and businesses, let us demand a more conscious brand of capitalism from both ourselves and others.   Bharati Jagdish is the host of Channel NewsAsia Digital News' hard-hitting On The Record, a weekly interview with thought leaders across Singapore, and The Pulse, Channel NewsAsia’s weekly podcast that discusses the hottest issues of the week.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/conscious-capitalism-room-for-social-responsibility-10242678"}, {"datetime": "20 May 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["commercial diving", "safety"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "'Just jump': In commercial diving industry, claims of risky practices surface", "content": " SINGAPORE: As a commercial diver, his job that day was to conduct underwater inspection works. But the sea was clearly choppy, and the 35-year-old felt it was unsafe to dive in. But when he alerted his supervisor, he recalled being told: “Just jump only bro, don’t care. Because the vessel wants to sail, the boss says must finish it now.” The same has happened at times when the underwater current was too strong. “They’ll tell you to go and try,” said the diver, adding that he encounters such practices in 60 per cent of jobs while freelancing for various companies. Such practices are “more or less” par for the course in “quite a few” companies, said another diver, 46. “Even if it’s not safe, they will try to make you do the job,” he added. The two men, who have a combined experience of more than 20 years working freelance and full-time jobs, told Channel NewsAsia that some companies risk divers’ safety to cut costs and complete jobs on time. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they fear for their careers. Their claims come after the death of fellow diver Jake Seet, 33, who went missing while conducting underwater operations at the Western Anchorage near Sentosa. His body was found on May 5 in the sea off Sentosa. The circumstances of his death are being investigated. There are other challenges, the divers said. Equipment like diving helmets and tank compressors can go years without being serviced, they claimed. For diving helmets, which supply air to the diver, this poor maintenance can lead to faulty valves, the 46-year-old diver said. “When you go deep, water will start to seep into the hat,” he said. “Sometimes when you report it to the company, they will tell you (they will fix it), but after four months, the same thing happens.” In addition, the divers alleged, these unsafe practices are compounded by a culture that punishes dissent. The 35-year-old diver said voicing out against non-compliance means getting blacklisted by the company. “If you’re not happy, you can go work for another company,” he would be told. On one occasion, he asked divers on the same job to follow the dive table, which shows how long someone can spend underwater in one dive. When one supervisor found out, he was pulled out from the team. “They tekan (punished) me by giving me extra tanks to carry down,” he said. “What most of these companies do is, once they know you dare to speak out, they bully you to a point where you think twice. “So it’s whether you want your rice bowl or continue arguing. They give you all the rough jobs; the easy jobs they give the guys who keep quiet. If you’re five minutes late, they tekan you. They make your life very difficult because you go against them.” The 46-year-old diver said he’s argued with supervisors on a number of occasions. “They didn’t call me for a while,” he said. “But after they couldn’t get divers, they started calling me back, but I didn’t entertain them.” NOT SURPRISED Responding to these claims, Commercial Diving Association Singapore (CDAS) chairman Abdul Malik said he’s heard of similar reports from “a lot” of divers. “I won’t be surprised that this kind of activities occur in the commercial diving industry,” he told Channel NewsAsia. “Because it happens everywhere.” He added that in any industry, “there will be some companies who try to squeeze the employees as much as possible”. In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson said commercial diving companies are required to take \"reasonably practicable\" measures to ensure the safety and health of their workers. \"These include conducting risk assessments to identify hazards and implement effective risk control measures, making sure the work environment is safe, and making sure adequate safety measures are taken for any machinery, equipment or process used at the workplace,\" the spokesperson added. \"Employees who spot unsafe work practices can make a report to MOM through the SnapSAFE app or through the hotline at 6317 1111. Their identity will be kept strictly confidential.”  For company divers with such grievances, Mr Malik urged them to approach MOM, the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees' Union or CDAS itself. “On their behalf, we can move forward and find some solutions to this,” he said. For freelance divers, Mr Malik said they should stop taking up jobs from such companies. “Among themselves, I’m sure they know which companies are better to work for,” he added.  He continued: “If there’s a genuine safety concern, they should raise it up, and if it’s not being addressed, they should not feel a threat. “If they get marked and they don’t get called for other jobs, for me there’s nothing to lose. They shouldn’t be working those jobs.” And if they feel their options are limited, Mr Malik said they should attend skills upgrading courses that allow them to work for different types of jobs in the commercial diving industry. WHY IS IT STILL SO UNSAFE? Commercial divers work in jobs that include inspecting and maintaining ships, assembling and demolishing jetties, and docking and repairing ships in a shipyard. It is a physically demanding industry that pits divers against poor visibility, strong currents and falling objects, Mr Malik said. This makes threats ranging from drowning to decompression sickness very real. According to media reports, there have been at least five commercial diving-related deaths since 2010.  Mr Malik said some companies still adopt unsafe practices because they are “squeezed” by clients whose vessels are docked for only a few hours. “If they want the job, they have to cut corners because they cannot meet the time,” he explained. Another reason, Mr Malik said, is the cost of safety. While diving helmets already cost S$10,000 a piece, sending it in for minimal servicing can cost S$200. Training an in-house technician is not cheap either. “Some companies are a bit tight on budget, so these things can happen,” Mr Malik added, referring to reports of poorly-maintained equipment. WHAT IS BEING DONE? To tackle the problem, Mr Malik said MOM has been carrying out enforcement operations, but added that this is still a work in progress. “They can’t be everywhere all at once,” he said. On CDAS’ part, Mr Malik said it will advise member companies that are found to be unsafe on how to improve their operations. “If we kick them out of the association, what happens is they will just go on with their own way and continue to put divers at risk,” he said. “So, we feel it’s better to engage them and promote safety within their company.” Nevertheless, Mr Malik said CDAS will have “no qualms” about reporting recalcitrant companies to MOM. The industry is regulated under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act, meaning companies convicted of lapses face a maximum fine of S$500,000, while individuals may be fined up to S$200,000 and/or jailed for up to 24 months. Industry safety standards are also outlined in the Code of Practice for Diving at Work (SS 511) and the Technical Advisory for Inland/Inshore Commercial Diving Safety and Health. While these are not legal guidelines, they can be used as reference during prosecution under the WSH Act. The SS 511 is also being revised and is expected to be published by the end of the year, a spokesperson from national standards body Enterprise Singapore told Channel NewsAsia. Drafted changes include specifying that commercial divers need to be certified by an authorised training school in addition to in-house training provided by companies, Mr Malik said. BLACK SHEEP Still, Mr Malik said he observes that more than half of commercial diving companies comply with safety standards. “A lot of members feel they put in a lot of effort to ensure the divers are diving safe,” he said. “They have the best equipment and do thorough risk assessments. They’re spending thousands of dollars sending the divers for training. “There are companies who treat their divers fairly and provide the best safety precautions, some maybe not.” The owner of a prominent commercial diving company, who has more than 20 years of diving experience, said the divers making the claims should understand the standards stipulated in the SS 511 and technical advisory. For example, the technical advisory states that diving using commercial scuba gear is still allowed in currents of up to one knot, although it should not be routine. The advisory doesn’t prohibit diving in choppy water either, explaining that “it is a matter of judgment by the diving supervisor onsite, to decide when diving should stop due to an adverse sea state”. “If the company forces him to do anything outside of the standards it adopts, then of course he has a right to complain,” said the owner, who did not want to be named. “If there are companies that have less stringency or do not follow a standard, then I would say that it’s only a matter of time before the law catches up with them.” As for the culture of punishing those who stand up for safety, the owner said responsible employers would send safety officers to the ground to ensure protocol is followed. “I don’t have a right as a supervisor or employer to force the diver to dive if he feels it’s unsafe,” he said. “We have a stop work policy, and at any one time when he feels it is unsafe, he has right to say he does not want to dive.” Similarly strict policies are applied to the maintenance of equipment, the owner said, adding that he hires dive technicians to keep track of servicing schedules while regularly updating them in a database. So does he feel there are companies that still scrimp on safety? “In any case, there would be,” he said. “But lately, MOM has been policing this and they are doing their work. So whether or not there are still companies behaving in this manner, I’m not sure. In the past, yes. Now, it is much better.” The 46-year-old diver said while the industry is much safer now compared to a decade ago, there is still a long way to go. “Most experienced divers dare to tell the supervisor off, but we are trying to protect the younger ones,” he said. “Because they are the ones who are putting their lives in danger.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/commercial-diving-industry-unsafe-practices-surface-10245154"}, {"datetime": "20 May 2018 06:33AM", "tags": ["On the Record", "Teo You Yenn"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Universal welfare and saying 'no' to tuition: Teo You Yenn goes On the Record about inequality", "content": " SINGAPORE: It is not often that a book by an academic makes the  bestseller lists. But for the past four months, sociologist, Teo You Yenn’s This Is What Inequality Looks Like has flown off the shelves of local bookstores, and was even brought up in Parliament by Nominated Member of Parliament Kuik Shiao-Yin in her speech about income inequality in Singapore. In recent weeks, as Parliament convened to debate the President’s Address, the income gap took centre stage again, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and others raising the issue of inequality.  Mr Lee emphasised the need for society to maintain an “informal and egalitarian tone”. Education Minister Ong Ye Kung argued for developing more pathways and opportunities in education and training, and changing mindsets about academic qualifications. This would, to some extent, increase social mobility. But Dr Teo feels that changes need to be bolder. During our interview, she mentions re-examining what is rewarded and what is punished in the education system and whether standardised tests like the PSLE do more harm than good. To listen to the full interview, click here. Her work, however, goes beyond education to examine the impact of the challenges families face and, as we talk, it becomes clearer that she feels universal welfare is something worth seriously considering even though Singapore’s policies are largely geared towards self-reliance. In fact, Mr Ong said that while the Government must and will continue to extend assistance to the disadvantaged, self-reliance is a more dignified option over “easy and unconditional” handouts. DISCOMFORT, ANGER, SADNESS AND ADMIRATION To understand Dr Teo’s call for bolder measures, perhaps one must get acquainted with her work which began with a “simple goal”, she says. It was to better understand the everyday experiences of those living with low incomes. In her book, she says she visited two HDB rental flat neighbourhoods over the course of three years. Each household had an income of S$1,500 or less. The Associate Professor and Head of Sociology at Nanyang Technological University admits that her own high-income lifestyle was very different. Merely the act of travelling back and forth between her home and those of the people she spoke to was a powerful experience. “The stark contrast made me extremely uncomfortable. I also felt a great deal of anger at the injustice of the disparity. I felt at various time a great deal of sadness. I felt empathy, but I also felt admiration.” She notes in her book that regardless of their circumstances, those she spoke to cared deeply for the well-being of their children and it was common for them to, for example, skip meals so that their children could eat. “They are giving up real things. I think that is to be admired and acknowledged.” It was to make this group of people seen that she wrote the book in a manner quite contrary to traditional academic writing. She inserts herself and her perspectives on the findings because she says it was \"key to shifting our lenses for viewing inequality and poverty more fully”. She also visited six other neighbourhoods a few times to get a sense of how different neighbourhoods might be. She made 90 visits in total, spending three to four hours each time and speaking to two or three families during each visit. In all, she spoke to more than 200 people, growing comfortable in their homes while listening to their stories. As I wrote this, I realised that listing these statistics risks reducing the people she met to impersonal, disembodied numbers. Dr Teo herself was careful not to do this. Hers was an immersive experience.  She would sit on their living-room floor and listen to how day-to-day challenges were holding them and their children back. But she tells these stories in the book largely as a matter of fact and without embellishments. She tells of the mother who is afraid to walk through the nearby shopping mall with her kids because she’s afraid they’ll ask her to “buy this, buy that” when she can’t possibly afford to. She tells of the family who had to share a 2-bedroom interim rental flat with another family. The bathroom floor was “so disgusting” that the children wouldn’t enter it without slippers on. They were eventually evicted when they couldn’t pay the rent and ended up living in a rented van. She tells of how their children are impacted as a result of such conditions and how they have problems thriving in our education system as a result.  ALL OF US HAVE A STAKE It doesn’t take any embellishments for their stories to make one consider how, while Singapore has prospered as a nation and many of us have progressed, there are others who seem to be standing still. Dr Teo says while she hopes policymakers read the book, she did not write the book for them. “I wrote the book for all Singaporeans. Many Singaporeans care about the problems of poverty and inequality, have aspirations toward greater equality, and are interested in knowing more about how to think about these issues. All of us have a stake in thinking about and discussing what we want to see in our society.” She says her work urges us to not see the poor in Singapore as merely people who have “fallen through the cracks”. Instead, she encourages a careful consideration of how policies that have benefited others could be systemically working against this group. “I TRY NOT TO HELP MY DAUGHTER WITH HER HOMEWORK” Before we discuss policies, she emphasises that the choices each of us make can also have an impact.  For instance, by demanding ever higher standards for our children in school are we encouraging practices that marginalise this group further? In her own life, she has already made some adjustments. “I try not to help my daughter with her homework. No tuition, no enrichment classes. My husband and I try not to intervene too much, so that she doesn’t have more advantages than she already has. She's average. I think she has plenty. She’s grown up surrounded by books. She has been read to for years and years and years. For me, there is a strong sense that if you have certain privileges, you also have responsibilities and duties.” She quickly qualifies this. \"But I don't, by any means, want to imply that what I do is also what others should do. I really don't expect parents to not help their kids given our conditions. I think, in our context, it is reasonable for parents to give their kids tuition and to supervise their homework.\" However, she reveals that many middle-class parents have told her that her chapter on education was “difficult” to read.  “It forces them to think about what we are doing that perpetuates the system, that when we do what we think is best for our kids, it’s creating certain kinds of rules of the game that other kids can’t play.” WHAT IS OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM REWARDING AND PUNISHING? On a policy level, what is rewarded and what is punished within our education system needs looking at, she says. She points out what Singaporeans already know and have had vociferous debates about. “Although there is a lot of public spending on education, we also know that too much of success in schools depend on private investments from parents in education and so there needs to be significant changes within education so that the private investments are not so significant in shaping the success or failure of kids in school.” When I point to Learning Support Programmes in schools for those who don’t have the benefit of “private investments”, she explains that while these can help, it remains challenging for the kids to catch up since the more advanced pupils continue to move forward at a fast pace. In her book, she explains how by Primary 3, many children from low-income families are tracked and banded into lower-performing classes. They become “well aware of where they stand vis-à-vis others”. Many become demoralised, she says. Key to this is how the reward system is structured. “What should be required of kids should be things that are taught in schools rather than outside of schools. “There need to be adjustments to what is being rewarded and when it’s being rewarded because we know that in our system, being an early reader and an early writer, for example, is a huge advantage. Requiring that children, when they enter Primary One, already know how to read and write, immediately puts at a disadvantage the kids who do not have the kinds of conditions that allow them do that at that point.” The system, she believes, works even against general developmental principles. “Because children have such different developmental capacities, some may just not be ready to read and write. It doesn’t mean that they are incapable. Learning is partly about what people think and believe they can learn. Many of the kids I see are demoralised quickly once they enter school. These are smart kids. These are kids who have capabilities and yet they are demoralised very quickly because they are framed as 'weak'. When asked how to remedy this situation, she puts it simply. “All anybody needs is time. Give it more time. We don’t have to be so quick to judge which child should be in which lane, which child should be in which kind of band. When we do that, we are losing our very precious human talent.” EXAMS ARE DESIGNED TO “CREATE HIERARCHY” It’s no surprise that she is a proponent of scrapping the PSLE. “We know what exams are like and what they test. If we are very honest, we also know that the fact that we did very well in a certain exam, doesn’t mean we really learnt those things that we were able to reproduce in the exams. I would say that if you ask me now about math, physics or chemistry, or any of the other things I aced my exams in, I have to be very honest and tell you that I’m not sure I learnt that much through that process.” She encourages experts in pedagogy to weigh in on issues such as the benefits of specialised learning and how best to teach kids so that they can develop their capacities well. At the core of it, Dr Teo is convinced that “a huge purpose of the exams obviously is to sort and to create hierarchy”. “It is to reward kids differently for how well they do on those exams. If we come back to merit, if we believe that it is important that we reward people for what they can do, their capabilities and the value they can therefore bring to society, then I think we  shouldn’t be using these standardised exams that don’t necessarily capture those abilities and competencies.” She is careful not to be too prescriptive in terms of offering alternatives, choosing instead to leave it to experts in the field. She does, however, offer her experience as a university professor.  “In any given course in a university, there will be many different components of evaluation. We look at attendance, how they interact in a classroom and what they contribute to discussions in a classroom. We look at the extent to which they can collect different kinds of evidence and data to build their arguments, we look at the extent to which they are able to read things and synthesise those things in essays, we look at how they can compile different kinds of visual information into a presentation and present it in class. We try to have a range of different kinds of evaluation methods.” SUCCESS STORIES ARE THE EXCEPTION When others say that back in the day, they too grew up with disadvantages that they managed to overcome and why can’t those in the lower-income group today do the same, she feels they are missing a huge piece of the puzzle. “I think social context is important. I think most of the people saying that now would not expect their children to grow up like they did. We should not have double standards for our children versus other peoples’ children. Reasonable people would say, 'Well, I grew up like that but I can also understand that today I would not expect my kids to grow up in those same circumstances'. “But also, what kids need to thrive now is different from what kids needed to thrive even when I was in primary school in the 1980s. When I was growing up, my parents spent zero hours teaching me or helping me with homework or tuition and it was fine. I could still excel. That is the same amount of time my friends’ parents were spending on their homework - zero. That was the norm. We were playing fair with one another. If you believe that merit is important, then we were playing fair and we were playing fair to see who had more merit.” While there are several success stories of social mobility achieved as a result of education, she claims they are exceptions. “We do not need to close the door on any individual’s story, but we must be able to place them in the wider context of larger empirical patterns, rather than cherry-picking isolated cases of exceptions. “In the three years when I did my research, I saw that for most low-income families, even just passing the PSLE is an achievement. Most of the kids get streamed into low tracks. A single case stands out in my mind of a child who might make it into university. These are not good odds for success, they are extremely poor ones.The doors to upward mobility through education are very much narrower for them than for kids from more affluent families.” She doesn’t deny that today, as she looks back, she sees a period in Singapore’s history where social mobility was much more common.  MISGUIDED COMPARISONS Growing up, she says her parents “experienced a great deal of upward social mobility”. When she was a child, she could see “with a certain amount of money, come a lot of different choices and different opportunities that open a lot of doors”. “I think it was an important part of my life experience growing up. I could see that I had all kinds of opportunities that my parents didn’t have and that certainly, my grandparents didn’t have. I also had certain kinds of opportunities that other members of my extended family may not have had. I think a lot of other Singaporeans experienced this.” The question is whether that had a direct link solely to individual effort and educational policies or was it also a question of something larger. Dr Teo points out that success today is often attributed to a person’s hard work, their ability to overcome their adverse circumstances and if they aren’t able to, it is seen as a personal failing. It’s clear she feels otherwise. “The huge improvement in people’s lives that we’ve seen over the last decade is partly because Singapore became so much wealthier over a very short period of time and so there was definitely an expansion in the overall wealth of the country and that expansion certainly also meant that a lot of peoples’ lives did improve. So part of the upward social mobility is not necessarily about climbing a static ladder. Part of that experience is about the fact that we grew up in those decades when Singapore experienced a wide expansion. “That kind of radical growth in terms of development and in terms of the wealth of a country is not going to be replicated. That’s a historical anomaly. Given that we are at a different point in economic development today, that story is not going to play out for the people who are now young and who are making their way into the adult world.” HELP IS AVAILABLE BUT CHALLENGING TO ATTAIN She acknowledges the increase in social spending in Singapore but the way assistance programmes are structured often diminishes their impact and if, as a result, parents are in a state of constant insecurity, their children are naturally affected. “A lot of how the state structures access to public goods depends heavily on their employment.  The quality and quantity of services people can access is still very much dependent on that.” In her book, she gives the example of childcare options for parents from low-income households. While others might be able to afford foreign domestic helpers and other care options, these individuals have to deal with many more limitations. Government-linked childcare centres are heavily subsidised and affordable, but the subsidies are tied to the mother’s employment. She calls this “a circular problem”. Without help with childcare, the women are unable to find jobs in the first place. Without stable employment, they are not able to secure a place in childcare centres. “The underlying principle for this is that wage work is the primary form of work that should be valued and also that that’s the most important thing about being human. The problem with this is that given that people earn such unequal wages, if access to public goods is still dependent on wages, then those inequalities are not going to be reduced.” This is borne out in many other ways when such individuals seek assistance. In her book, she explains how many of them remark that means-testing entails intrusive probing and if they can avoid it, they would, even if it means forgoing assistance. She also points out that many of these individuals work in jobs with little stability. They work shifts that could change often and there is often no guarantee of how many hours of work they’ll get a week. They are also seen as “easily replaceable” and their employers do not take too kindly to requests for leave to take care of their children when the need arises. This instability, no doubt, poses challenges for parenting their children but also brings us to another critical facet of the issue. “I see particularly through this research that there are a lot of people who work as hard as I do, who are no less than I am, but who end up with very different outcomes because their employment does not give them the wages that could help them rely on themselves.” In past columns, she has spoken about corporations that pay some of their workers badly, and wealthier segments of the population who enjoy certain goods and services at low prices. \"We know that the benefits of the world's wealth have become increasingly monopolised by a smaller and smaller group of corporations. Those are outcomes of specific regulations on parts of states in various different countries. Those are the outcomes of specific practices. It’s not some invisible hand of the market doing those things.\"  Changing this, she feels, requires an acknowledgement on the part of states that it is something they have a measure of control over and not something that is an inevitable by-product of globalisation and capitalism.   But societal change on the part of consumers and businesses is important too and this is one of the reasons for her book – to encourage us to realise our blind spots. IS UNIVERSAL WELFARE THE ANSWER? Ultimately, I wonder what she thinks policymakers should be doing differently to tackle inequality and increase social mobility.  Considering the Government’s robust narrative of self-reliance, how can initiatives be designed more effectively taking this into account? “It’s important to pose the question differently, not in terms of, 'Can this person afford to do this?' We need to ask, 'Well, what is it that every person needs?' And as a society what do we need to do so that people can meet all these basic needs as a baseline? We can have reasonable discussions about what we can collectively agree on are basic needs.\" She is currently in the midst of research that aims to gauge what society considers \"basic needs\" that everyone should have regardless of their personal ability to afford them.  “Universalism in meeting fundamental needs, such as housing, healthcare and retirement security, would protect everyone in society from precarity, instead of making dignity and security dependent on private earnings and wealth.” Arguments for universal welfare, she feels, should not be discredited outright. “People are very reasonable in terms of thinking about what is basic for a decent standard of living. Universal welfare in this context is not a slippery slope. Empirically, I found that people value work. A lot of sociological work has shown that the value of work, the meanings people take from work go beyond the income they earn from the work. Work is a very important part of peoples’ sense of self and peoples’ sense of worth. The assumption that if you don’t make life difficult for people, they won’t work, is just not true.” But if more were done in this regard, the rest of society too must be willing to do more. “There needs to a serious conversation about whether taxes may be worth paying to reduce the insecurity and divisiveness that inequality inflicts on us all. This is especially given the room for more progressive taxes. The personal income tax rates for high earners, as well as wealth taxes such as estate taxes and capital gains tax are lower than in many other countries. To have this conversation across society on an informed basis, we also need the publication of more transparent and detailed information about projected revenue and expenditure. “The countries that the world knows have done a lot better on these issues are the Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway, etc. I think economically, these are all places that are doing quite well. Often the argument is made that if you did a lot of these things, your economy would go bust and that’s just not empirically true.” These countries may have a greater commitment to redistribution, but certainly a fine balance has to be struck to prevent a descent into a failed welfare state.  As we come to the end of our conversation, I ask her how she might feel if her position on issues is seen as being too idealistic and impossible to implement. What she says next is something she feels ought to be applied to her own views too. “Research, writing and telling stories about society are often dominated by people who are in positions of relative power. This would include politicians and intellectuals. I think it’s important that people in positions to either make decisions or tell stories, don’t tell their stories or make decisions as if their perspectives are the universal perspectives. The act of making decisions or telling stories should be one that includes the voices and perspectives of people outside that narrow class of people.” It was why she inserted herself into her research to make it clear to readers where she is speaking from - her lenses and her blind spots - and for them to then make sense of the work and evaluate it independently.  She sees it as her “responsibility and duty” to further her research in the hopes of finding not just answers, but questions as well. “I hope to continue to learn from people who are coming at this issue from different places, who have different perspectives and different expertise to share. Knowledge production is not a static thing. There are more things to do and more questions and more puzzles to answer.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teo-you-yenn-this-is-what-inequality-looks-like-on-the-record-10246872"}, {"datetime": "20 May 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["cna insider", "e-scooter", "accident"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "Why being hit by an e-scooter can be deadly - and a call to ban them from footpaths", "content": " SINGAPORE: They may seem light, minimalist devices, but a hit by an e-scooter packs a wallop about nine times that of an average person’s punch – or more energy than a professional boxer’s punch. And that’s if the e-scooter is travelling at the legal limit of 15kmh when it hits you. This is enough force to easily send a grown man flying into the air, what more a frail senior citizen or a young child. But even so, it’s not the direct impact of the collision itself that pedestrians should be concerned about. It’s what happens next that is the most dangerous, according to Associate Professor Yap Fook Fah from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. “As the body falls, the head will hit the ground at a speed of 15kmh, 20kmh or even higher - that is equal to 1.5 or two tonnes of force,” he told the programme Talking Point, after demonstrating the magnitude of the impact in a lab. Studies show that this \"could lead to very serious head injuries such as loss of consciousness, skull fracture, haemorrhage, tissue damage and so on”. And then, he added for good measure – if the pedestrian is “really unlucky”, this is followed by the rider landing on the pedestrian, crushing him or her. In March, a 45-year-old woman had to undergo brain surgery after she was hit by an e-scooter as she stepped off an overhead bridge. A 23-year-old man was arrested for causing a rash act. In a recent episode, Talking Point explored the debate on whether personal mobility devices (PMDs) like e-scooters should be more stringently regulated, or even banned from footpaths altogether. CAN’T STOP IN TIME From January to September 2017, there were about 110 accidents involving PMDs. Of these, 30 involved pedestrians on footpaths and walkways. The same year, the authorities decided on more stringent rules that would move e-scooters from the roads to the pavements, with speeds capped at 15kmh on footpaths and 25kmh on shared and cycling paths. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But it’s not the physics of a collision alone that makes e-scooters a potentially growing danger in Singapore: There’s the proliferation of these devices, particularly in the hands of young and inexperienced riders; and the fact that stopping in time is not as simple as some riders might think. To illustrate, programme host Diana Ser conducted an experiment where an e-scooter rider had to brake when the host flagged her to stop. In the first run-throughs at 15kmh, it took the rider 1.65m to 3.2m to come to a complete stop. The implication: Even at the legal speed limit, the likelihood of collision is extremely high if a pedestrian suddenly appears in front of a rider. When the rider ratcheted her speed up to 25kmh – the legal limit on shared paths – it took her up to 7m to come to a complete stop. The lag times make these devices particularly dangerous when ridden in places like void decks. Take 65-year-old Madam Lee, who in April, was stepping out of a lift when she was hit from behind and fell. She hadn’t heard the e-scooter coming. The rider, who also fell, picked up his device and sped off without so much as a word, she recalled.  “I screamed, “Why did you ride here? You can’t ride here,” said Mdm Lee who suffered a cut on the face and some bruises.  (Read: 15-year-old assisting police in Ang Mo Kio e-scooter accident investigation) In another incident that same month, a 24-year-old e-scooter rider was arrested after crashing into an 11-year-old girl from behind. She needed to have her jaw and gums realigned, aside from losing two teeth, said her father. AGE, IMMATURITY PLAY A PART Then there are those who illegally modify their rides to travel in excess of 100kmh – faster than some motorcycles. Mr Victor Lee, general manager of e-scooter distributor Falcon PEV, said he has heard that the highest speed clocked by an e-scooter was a staggering 140kmh. Last October, three men aged between 32 and 37 were arrested after they were caught riding their e-scooters at speeds of more than 100kmh along Nicoll Drive. Still, Mr Lee was of the view that it is the rider, not the ride, that makes the difference. “A very experienced rider – whether he’s riding a modified or a fully compliant e-scooter – would have the foresight and awareness to slow down to a speed that he can handle, and that is safe for the public,” he said. WATCH: From braking, to impact (2:13)  Many accidents are caused by young riders, typically below 20 years of age, he said. “They are the ones who, due to a lack of maturity, training and experience, do get into more accidents.” And with more e-scooter sharing services entering the market, there have been concerns over how responsible these service providers are. Telepod, the first e-scooter hire service to launch in Singapore, said they impose no minimum age limit. Their youngest user is a primary school student. But to use their services, riders are required to have a debit or credit card, said chief executive Ms Gan Jin Ni, and most young children would not have access to these unless they had their parents’ permission. “We actually have some form of control because the parents would be aware, and they would decide whether they want the kid to use the service or not,” she said. REVIEW SPEED LIMITS, OR BAN E-SCOOTERS Elsewhere in the world, the tide is turning: In San Francisco earlier this year, for example, e-scooter sharing companies were prohibited from operating. In Singapore, the number of riders travelling in an inconsiderate and reckless manner has been rising, noted the Active Mobility Advisory Panel. Hence its proposed mandatory registration for all e-scooters, to kick in later this year. This month, the Active Mobility Act took effect, which not only spells out the rules and codes of conduct for the safe use of PMDs, but also gives the authorities more teeth to deal with reckless PMD users. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But for all these measures, the presence of e-scooters on pavements here is still provoking debate. (Read: E-scooter community disagrees on effectiveness of new measures to curb errant riding) For instance, in Parliament this week, Non-Constituency MP Dennis Tan called for the “unsafe” speed limit of 25kmh on shared paths such as park connectors to be lowered. Others are calling for an outright ban on e-scooters from footpaths - given impetus by the rising number of accidents and people feeling unsafe, acknowledged Mr Andrew Cheah, acting director for the Land Transport Authority’s Active Mobility Unit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He said the unit is keeping “a very close eye on the situation on the ground”, and hoped for a more gracious culture where all pedestrians and riders “behave responsibly and co-exist in a respectful manner”. “But say, in the future we find that it is difficult to achieve this and more measures are needed –it is safe to say that we will not hesitate to take firmer action as well,” he added.

Cindy Tan was busy working instead, trying to raise two children as a single mother after her divorce.  Her daughter's distrust, and hatred even, was the heavy price she paid. It was years later, when she was in her 50s, that Mdm Tan got an unexpected second chance to learn to be a mother again – the mother she'd never really been – to Valerie, who was nearly 30.  \"It was like taking care of a newborn again,” she said. She had to be alert to her daughter’s safety nearly every minute. She had to help her form sentences in response to questions. Except that the daughter she was now taking care of had schizophrenia. To help heal her child's broken mind, Mdm Tan had to figure out how to mend their broken relationship. It was a daunting task that required rebuilding a fragile trust with an already-resentful daughter, whose illness made her prone to paranoia, suspicion, and withdrawal. It left Mdm Tan at her wit’s end, at one stage. “I did plan to kill ourselves,\" she confesses, painfully. \"I didn’t know what to do any more. I didn’t know how to help her.” WATCH: A mother-daughter love story (6:56)  But, just as her daughter's own journey to recovery is today a beacon of hope for those suffering from mental illness; so Mdm Tan's parallel road is proof that it is never too late to be the mother your child needs you to be.CHILDHOOD: 'SHE WASN'T THERE FOR ME' Valerie Liu grew up feeling as if she was deprived of both a father and a mother. After her parents divorced early, her dad was no longer part of the family’s lives. Her mother, on the other hand, was a businesswoman who promised herself that she would give her daughter and younger son a “life of luxury”. “I just wanted their father to know that I could afford the two of them together,” said the 61-year-old. But chasing that goal meant that her children were brought up by their grandmother and relatives. From the time Ms Liu was nine, her mother worked abroad as a director in a company, returning only once or twice a year. And so began a rocky mother-daughter relationship. Ms Liu, who is now 36, said: “She wasn’t there for me, so I felt that I wasn’t cared for nor loved.” It reached a point where they could not even have a “normal conversation” when her mother was on one of her rare visits home. Whenever we talked, we’d fight and scold each other. Sometimes I’d just slam my door. And if I didn’t like certain topics she talked about, I’d just leave the house. Mdm Tan remembers one incident in particular. Her daughter was about 14 or 15 and snapped at her, saying: “When I needed you, where were you? When I don’t need you, when I’ve grown up already, why are you here?” By then, the resentful teenager no longer trusted her. She had previously taken her mother into her confidence after experiencing a childhood trauma. Without disclosing what happened, she said simply: “How could I trust her when she didn’t believe me?” Turning to the company of friends instead, she became a “wayward person” – in her own words – who went clubbing, drank and smoked. FIRST SYMPTOMS: 'I THOUGHT I WAS A DEITY' Ms Liu thinks her “bottled-up, negative feelings” eventually caused the onset of her mental illness in 2006 when she was doing a pre-university bridging course in Perth. Her symptoms included hallucinations and delusions. “I thought people were following me, and on the road, I kept hearing voices in my head,” she shared. I also could hear the news talking about me. I thought I could talk to the radio. I thought I had superpowers … I thought I was a deity. The fact is, there is no single cause for schizophrenia, said Dr Charmaine Tang, the deputy clinical chief and consultant at the Institute of Mental Health’s Department of Psychosis. “Like many other illnesses, the causes are multifactorial and include both environmental and genetic factors,\" she explained.  For example, illicit drug use is \"a well-known environmental factor associated with the development of schizophrenia\", while having a relative with the illness also increases one’s risk. “Traumatic and stressful experiences do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger a schizophrenic episode in a vulnerable individual who is predisposed.”  During the period that Ms Liu was experiencing these episodes, the scared girl would call her mother. But Mdm Tan thought it was just stress, as her daughter would be crying about her studies. She only realised that \"something was really not right\" when her son, who was also studying in Perth, called to say that his sister was in a very bad state and should return to Singapore. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ms Liu came back to an empty four-room flat, as her mother was working in China. And over two years, her paranoia worsened. She recalls how the voices in her head told her that “the neighbours and my mother were conspiring against me”. One day, she lost control. Feeling that her neighbours upstairs were disturbing her, she took a knife and knocked on their doors. The police were called in, and she was brought to IMH. She cannot remember the incident, though her mother does. When Mdm Tan received the phone call about the case, she was “shivering”, and she flew home immediately. AWKWARD START: 'I DIDN'T TRUST HER' Ms Liu wasn't straightaway diagnosed with schizophrenia, but rather with psychosis. After staying at IMH for two to three months, she was released into her mother’s care. The slow process of recovery, and of tentatively restoring their relationship, began.  Medication was helping Ms Liu, but she doubted her mother’s desire to help. “I didn’t trust her totally. So I’d see her actions. I’d monitor her … How does she talk? Is she patient? A lot of things. Is her tone sincere?” she recalled. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Both mother and daughter agreed that it was “very awkward” initially. Mdm Tan said she tried building up their relationship as if she was “trying to tackle” a potential boyfriend. “When you want to tackle somebody, you always try to please,” she said. “You always give in … This was how I did it.” Her daughter can now laugh at the thought. At the time, however, it did not help that Mdm Tan returned to China soon after – in Ms Liu's mind, breaking her word.  She said that she’d stay and work in Singapore. It didn’t happen at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Still, four years went by and she did not suffer a relapse, until she went on a holiday to China to visit her mother. With everything seemingly fine, she'd stopped taking her medication. Consequently, the symptoms returned – worse than before. Back in Singapore, she heard voices again and became paranoid about people peeking into her bedroom. This time, when she was treated at IMH, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Sharing more about the condition, Dr Tang said: “Schizophrenia is a complex mental illness that usually has its onset in young individuals between the ages of 15 and 25. “Worldwide, about one in 100 adults have schizophrenia, and it affects men and women equally … Contrary to common misconceptions, schizophrenia isn’t a disorder of 'split personality', but rather a disorder of fragmented mental processes.” REKINDLING THE RELATIONSHIP It was after her daughter’s relapse that Mdm Tan realised things could not go on the way they had. \"Every day, she'd tell me, 'Mummy, help me, Please help me find my soul. I don’t know who I am. Get me my soul back.' It was so scary,\" she recalled with a hitch in her voice even now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To Ms Liu, the first sign that her mother wanted to change was when the latter begged for forgiveness. “If not, her tears wouldn’t have flowed,” she said.  She’s a very strong woman … and I hadn’t really seen her cry before. This time, Mdm Tan took unpaid leave from work. And while her daughter was getting treatment, she enrolled in a 12-week course for carers of patients with mental illness. When Ms Liu returned home, her mother observed her likes and dislikes. For example, because she was worried that people might peek at her, her mother installed blinds in their flat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ms Liu's biggest fear, however, was of the uncertainty about what was going wrong with her life. So she stayed cooped up at home. “I was very withdrawn ... I totally blocked off everyone.\" She also could not form proper sentences to express herself. Extreme apathy and social withdrawal, poverty of speech, a severe lack of emotional reactivity and disorganised behaviour are some of the common symptoms of schizophrenia, noted Dr Tang. Ms Liu’s mother guided her every step of the way, including once when she was just confused about how to climb the stairs of a pedestrian bridge. “I didn’t know how to coordinate. I was very scared. My mum encouraged me to take one step at a time,” she recalled. Mdm Tan said she slept only three hours a day during that period, ready to wake at any minute. She kept all the knives away and installed window grilles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But even as she had to be like a new mother again, she knew she could not act like a parent towards her daughter, or Ms Liu would not listen to her. “I could only act as a friend because she’d only talk to the friend and listen to her friend,” she said. It worked. From young, her daughter had never wanted to hug or even hold hands with her. But as trust started to grow anew, Mdm Tan tried slowly to hold her child's hand when they went for walks. “Little bit by little bit … until, oh my God, she didn’t let go of my hand – so, continue holding,” she said delightedly. Now they can call themselves “best friends”, her daughter added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SEA CHANGE Their relationship now is one of the reasons Ms Liu can call her illness a “blessing in disguise”. Another is her new lifestyle. She started exercising – “at least three times a week” – and sleeping early, before 10pm. “I’d put all my devices outside the room, which I didn’t use to do. In the past, I’d put my handphone beside me on the bed, for people to jio (invite) me to go out, especially at night,” she said. Her name was another change she made as part of a fresh start. She felt that the name Valerie was more auspicious. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In 2014, during her recovery process, she started work as a receptionist in a non-profit mental health organisation. She was initially reluctant because of her social anxiety. But her mother helped by accompanying her at first. “After a few days, she said, ‘You go to work on your own. And then you text me if anything’s wrong,'” Ms Liu recalled. She pulled through, she thinks, because of the conducive environment and helpful colleagues. “They were very understanding. They knew about my condition.\" Two years later, she joined the Singapore Association for Mental Health. She is now a community education officer and also a peer support specialist, for which she is trained to help others with mental health issues. That role in co-leading groups of people towards recovery by, for example, sharing her experiences, has become her passion. “It really motivates me,” she said.  When you hold out hope for others, they will feel hopeful. And when you believe in them, they start to believe in themselves too. Just like when my mom held out hope for me. While she considers herself to be a recovered patient, she hopes she can do better, to repay her mother “for what she has done”. “Without her, I won’t be where I am today,” said an emotional Ms Liu, who also credited her relatives. “I want to maintain my health so that, in future, I can have the strength to take care of her.” As for any hopes of having a partner, Mdm Tan showed her protective motherly side by making sure that such questions were off the table for this story. Looking back, she understands why her daughter was angry with her. “What she wanted was love. What she wanted was security from me, but I wasn’t there for such a long period,” she said. Now she gets to give her daughter all that and be the mother she always wanted to be – and best friend too.

The Singapore Police Force (SPF) said the raids were at Jalan Besar, Beach Road, Bencoolen Street, Telok Blangah Rise, Jalan Minyak, Owen Road, Hong Kong Street, Topaz Road, Aliwal Street, Trengganu Street, King George’s Ave, Syed Alwi Road, Victoria Street and Bendemeer Road.   Officers arrested 19 men and 19 women between the ages of 21 and 80 for vice, gambling and immigration-related offences.  Among them were 11 women believed to have been providing paid sexual services at hotels and rented apartments while in Singapore on employment passes and short-term visit passes. They were arrested for offences under the Women's Charter.  Fifteen men and seven women were arrested for remote gambling-related offences along King George’s Ave, Telok Blangah Rise, Jalan Minyak, Beach Road and Bendemeer, the police said, adding that S$2,400 was seized from them.  The remaining four men were arrested for immigration-related offences while a woman was arrested for using criminal force against a public servant, they added.  Journalists were invited to join police officers for a gambling raid at King George’s Avenue and later a vice operation at Syed Alwi Road on Friday, the last day of the operation. After plainclothes police officers descended on a coffee shop along King George’s Avenue at around 7.30pm, Channel NewsAsia arrived at the scene and noticed several men had been taken aside for suspected illegal horse-betting. Officers found some of the men – including an 80-year-old – possessed betting slips. While some sat quietly, others protested loudly and argued with officers. After an hour, the suspects were handcuffed and led away in a police vehicle. Later at 10.30pm, Channel NewsAsia accompanied officers to Syed Alwi Road for a vice operation. In the thick of the crowd, we spotted plainclothes officers questioning two Indian national women who had been soliciting at nearby coffee shops. Moments later, another two women were arrested further down the road at another coffee shop for offences under the Women’s Charter. All four women are believed to be part of a syndicate and suspected of providing sexual services from hotels and rental apartments while in Singapore on employment passes and short-term visit passes.  In a statement, the police said they would “spare no effort” to clamp down on vice and criminal activities.  “Those found engaging in illicit activities will be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law,” the statement said. Landlords and hotel owners are to ensure that tenants do not carry out vice activities in their premises, the police said.  Under the Women’s Charter, unlicensed brothel operators can be punished with a fine of up to S$10,000 and up to five years’ imprisonment. Any person who knowingly lives wholly or in part on the earnings of the prostitution of another person can also be jailed up to five years and fined up to S$10,000. Any person found guilty of gaming in any public can also be fined up to S$5,000 and jailed up to six months.

Speaking to reporters following his visit to Malaysia to meet Dr Mahathir, who was sworn in as Malaysia's prime minister on May 10, Mr Lee stressed that the visit was a courtesy call to send Dr Mahathir his good wishes, and that no \"substantive bilateral issues\" were discussed. He added that the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project was not discussed during the visit. The high-speed rail linking the two nations was agreed on under former prime minister Najib Razak's administration and was set to be completed by 2026. However, Dr Mahathir has said that all major projects will be reviewed by the new government, with local contractors to be prioritised.   Mr Lee said he also expressed the hope that both countries would also be able to continue the regular retreats which Singapore and Malaysia’s prime ministers had been holding.  “So I hope that once he has settled all of his domestic priorities, which he has many, he will be able to follow it up,” he said. \"In November, we’re hosting the ASEAN summit and I look forward to receiving him in Singapore.\" \"MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS\" Mr Lee added that Singapore has worked with Malaysia over many years and have cooperation projects with each other. There are also issues, he said, that come up from time to time.  \"But we have made a lot of progress with the cooperation and we hope to continue to make further progress and to build on what we have achieved in the past,” he said. “I think he shares that hope.\" During his visit, Mr Lee also met Pakatan Harapan de facto leader Anwar Ibrahim and his wife, Malaysia’s deputy prime minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, to “re-establish the personal link” with him. He said that they had a \"general conversation\" on how Mr Anwar saw developments in Malaysia, his views on what has been happening, and what his plans were. \"I said to him, he's travelling to many countries in the world.

The national carrier sent an email to KrisFlyer members on Friday (May 18), asking them to ensure the mobile numbers and email addresses listed on their KrisFlyer profiles were up-to-date and actively used in preparation for this. Once 2FA is implemented, members will be asked to enter a one-time password (OTP) for certain KrisFlyer transactions such as accessing their profiles or making changes to their redemption group nominees.  By default, the OTP will be sent to the user's registered mobile number, with the registered email address used as an alternative if the mobile number is not available, SIA said in the email.  “Singapore Airlines is committed to providing our customers with a high level of online security. 2FA has been introduced as part of KrisFlyer’s ongoing efforts to enhance online security for the benefit of our members,\" the airlines told Channel NewsAsia in an email. The move comes about a month after the airline acknowledged that some KrisFlyer member accounts may have been compromised.  One KrisFlyer member, 34-year-old general manager Sherie Low, reported having 76,000 miles stolen from her account.  While there were alerts about the redemptions sent to an email address linked to her KrisFlyer account, Ms Low told Channel NewsAsia last month that the email account was inactive and she did not check it. She said she thought that KrisFlyer should update its system security. Currently, members can log into their accounts using their membership account number and a six-digit PIN.  \"At the very least it should be protected with a one-time password,\" she had said. \"They cannot have such a flimsy system that allows hackers to get into accounts so easily and also add nominees so easily.\" Another Facebook user by the name of Abhishek Singh also posted on SIA's Facebook page in February about an alleged theft of KrisFlyer miles.  Security experts Channel NewsAsia spoke to last month said numeric-only passwords, such as those currently used by KrisFlyer and some other frequent flyer programmes, are “extremely weak” and could potentially be cracked in minutes.  Multi-factor authentication, where users need to authenticate their credentials more than once in order to access their accounts, was one way airlines could improve the security of their frequent flier programmes, some of these experts had suggested. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/krisflyer-singapore-airlines-two-factor-authentication-10249320"}, {"datetime": "19 May 2018 06:19AM", "tags": ["Zero waste", "Plastic", "Environment"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Packaging-free stores sprout in Singapore, but will consumers give them the green light?", "content": " SINGAPORE: Earlier this month, Ms June Eng made plans to visit a new grocery store with her family but for this shopping trip, she had to be prepared. With three reusable containers in her bag, the recycling enthusiast headed to UnPackt – a social enterprise located in Jalan Kuras that sells daily necessities without packaging. Despite having to bring her own carrier, the 42-year-old, who became a vegetarian four years ago to reduce her carbon footprint, described it as an experience that she had been “looking forward to”.  “I always wanted to do this but never had the chance,” she said, while passing a container to her child to get a snack. “This is a good initiative that’s long overdue.” With an aim of reducing unnecessary waste, plastic bags or any form of plastic packaging are a no-no at UnPackt.  Instead of the usual pre-packed items that one is used to seeing at supermarkets, dried food, oils and cleaning supplies are stocked in self-service dispensers that line up the shelves. Customers are free to fill up their carriers with the amount they want and prices are determined by weight. The grocery store, which opened its doors just two weeks ago, is not alone in touting this packaging-free concept. At The Social Space, a multi-concept lifestyle store along Kreta Ayer Street, the refillery section is decked out with at least ten dispensers, each ranging from 15 to 20 litres. Items on sale include shampoo, eco-friendly dishwashing and laundry liquids. Pop-up store The Green Collective is also encouraging shoppers to bring more than just their own bags. Among the 15 eco-friendly brands gathered under one roof at OneKM Mall, two of them sell food items and Castile liquid soap without packaging. All three shops require consumers to bring their own containers and bottles, or purchase one in-store. At UnPackt, there is also the option of using a donated one for free. “ENCOURAGING START” These zero-waste businesses come as packaging continues to make a big contribution to Singapore's annual trash mountain.  Figures from the National Environment Agency (NEA) showed that 1.7 million tonnes of waste was generated domestically in 2016. Of this, one-third was packaging waste, such as single-use plastic bags and takeaway food containers, that could fill up more than 1,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.  With their stores offering plastic-free shopping options, the eco-conscious entrepreneurs are hoping to get Singaporeans started on reducing waste in their daily lives.  UnPackt’s co-founder Florence Tay said the response thus far has been “quite good”, with the grocery store seeing a couple of regulars within two weeks of opening.  “We managed to encourage some of the residents nearby to embark on purchasing without packaging,” said the former marketing manager at the Singapore Heart Foundation. “On their first time here, they had to use one of our recycled containers but subsequently, they started bringing their own.”  “This is definitely faster than I expected,” said Ms Tay. At The Social Space, its founders Daniel Yeow and Cheryl Ou have also had an “encouraging start” with consumers who may not have been committed environmentalists.  “There was one aunty who happened to walk by, decided to come into our store and started asking many questions like why we’re doing this and how the refillery concept works,” said Ms Ou. “She really had no clue as it was her first time seeing something like this.” “To be honest, I wasn’t expecting her to come back but she did and with her own containers. These are the unexpected customers who make us really happy.”   WIDENING THE REACH Still, the entrepreneurs are aware that not all consumers have given them the green light, especially in Singapore where the use of single-use plastic, such as straws and food packaging, are entrenched in the country’s consumption habits. “The aunty who lifted our spirits is not an anomaly, but neither is she the majority,” said Ms Ou, noting that most of the patrons at the refillery section continue to be zero-waste advocates. Echoing that, Mr Mayur Singh, a co-founder of The Green Collective, said Singaporeans are generally aware of environmental issues, though there remains a “missing gap” between awareness and action. “We all wanted to talk to more local consumers, which is why we are so happy to have the opportunity of a retail store in the heartlands. Just focusing on the expatriate community or those who are already eco-warriors won’t work,” said Mr Singh, who also runs social enterprise Coopita. Pricing is a strategy that the businesses are banking on to appeal to more consumers. Given the absence of individual packaging, the economics of bulk-purchasing allows UnPackt and The Social Space to price their products at 5 to 10 per cent cheaper, respectively. “We are already saving because we are buying in bulk,” said Mr Yeow. “When deciding how much of that savings we should transfer to our customers, we decided that it needs to be significant enough for people to go ‘Alright, I can give this a try!’”  Retail analyst Samuel Tan from Temasek Polytechnic's School of Business noted that while more Singaporeans are paying attention to sustainable living, it is still a “long journey” when it comes to educating and cultivating a change in the buying behaviours of consumers.  “Drawing from the experience of a leading environmentally-friendly retailer, it took years for Body Shop to be well accepted by shoppers for the brand’s belief and philosophy,” said Mr Tan, who suggested independent players like UnPackt to step up on their social media presence or consider tie-ups with bigger retailers.  Ms Jen Teo, executive director of the Singapore Environment Council, reckoned that with green consumerism on the rise, eco-friendly stores are a “step in the right direction” and will likely do well in the long run. But before that, more needs to be done to drum up awareness about Singapore’s environmental issues.  “Singaporeans will need to learn to reduce waste and recycle more if it is to reach the goal of becoming a Zero Waste Nation by 2030. The key lies in understanding what we should use less of, and what we can and should eliminate in our daily living,” said Ms Tan.  To spur more Singaporeans to take the first step towards reducing waste, The Green Collective has been holding weekly events, ranging from talks centred around various environmental issues to workshops on soap-making and upcycling of furniture.  Co-founder Danielle Champagne said: “The idea is not just to sell, but to make this into a one-stop shop to bring together people with similar mindset while exposing the wider population to a greener lifestyle.”  “We want to show that going green doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive,” she told Channel NewsAsia. “It is all about small, simple steps every day that make a difference.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/packaging-free-stores-sprout-in-singapore-but-will-consumers-10224644"}, {"datetime": "19 May 2018 06:19AM", "tags": ["schools", "parking", "ministry of education"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Schools will not have parking gantries; season parking decals will be given instead: MOE ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Parking gantries using the electronic parking system will not be available in schools in order to “keep administrative workload and implementation costs low”, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said, even as questions were asked whether the monthly season parking directive applies to co-curricular activities (CCA) coaches and instructors. A ministry spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that all staff who use a regular parking lot on school premises are required to pay season parking and, for parity, this applies to others whose dedicated workplace is on school premises and require a parking lot, such as bookshop and canteen vendors. “Likewise, any other commercial parties, including CCA coaches and instructors, who wish to be given assured parking access to park regularly in schools would also be required to pay for season parking,” the spokesperson said. “This is implemented across all schools.”  The MOE spokesperson also said schools will ensure the season parking holders and visitors keep to their designated parking lots. Parking decals will be issued to the former for “easier identification of vehicles”, he added. Responding to the question on how season parking will be operationalised, MOE explained that \"pro-rated and short-term parking rates, administered through methods such as parking gantries with electronic parking system, are currently not available in schools to keep administrative workload and implementation costs low.”   The ministry had announced earlier in March that teachers will have to pay for monthly season parking rates if they want to park their cars or motorcycles at school car parks from August this year.  \n\n\n\n\n The Straits Times had reported in March that others who might need to pay for season parking include canteen stall operators and coaches and instructors who go to schools regularly, but these fees will not apply to ad hoc visitors such as parents or volunteers. The season parking announcement came after MOE said it was reviewing car park policy for schools after the Audit-General's Office (AGO) 2014/2015 Financial Year report noted that the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic did not impose charges or had charges that were below the market rate. FAIR OR NOT FAIR? Separately, some CCA coaches and instructors have questioned if it is fair for them to pay the full season parking fee though. One of them is Mr Edwin Tham, who teaches debates to students from various primary and secondary schools as well as junior colleges. When informed of the need to pay for season parking at Henry Park Primary School on May 4, Mr Tham asked if coaches like himself will “need a (car park) lot too even if they’re there for their CCA sessions”. The school teacher in charge confirmed this to be so. Asked if there’s an alternative parking scheme for CCA coaches, the teacher said: “No, I’m afraid not at the moment. It’s the same deal for us too.” Mr Tham said: “It’s definitely not fair, especially when instructors spend far less time in schools compared to teachers and it eats into a huge portion of an instructor’s income. In addition, instructors do not share the employment terms of teachers.” Another CCA coach, who requested to remain unnamed, said it is “ridiculous” that coaches and instructors and even parent volunteers have to pay the S$720 season parking fee. “We are often in the same school once or twice a week for an average of two hours per day,” the coach added. “Hence (when the parking fee is factored in), our hourly fee becomes ridiculously expensive.” When asked about this, Henry Park Primary’s administration manager Nelly Goh said the season parking fee is in line with the ministry’s guidelines for schools. “The school has limited car park lots. To manage demand from non-school staff who would like to park in the school, we would require CCA instructors and coaches to pay season parking charges,” Ms Goh said. “Alternatively, they may park at car parks outside of school.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/schools-will-not-have-parking-gantries-season-parking-decals-10216506"}, {"datetime": "19 May 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["music", "elderly", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Derrick A Paulo,", "title": "After facing death, a busker's mission to fill a void in old folks' lives with joy", "content": " SINGAPORE: It is quiet, almost sombre, in the wards of the nursing home moments before Mr Jack Tan arrives. And it seems as if the only reception he will get would be the impassive faces of the patients. But that is before the transformation begins. That is why the 56-year-old is there. That is his thing. Once his equipment is set up and he starts on his electronic wind instrument, a range of emotions ripple through the three wards of the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home. Resident Lilian Khoo, who is usually depressed and moody, is on her feet and dancing to the oldies he is playing for them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “I’ve never seen her as happy as I’ve seen her today,” says Mr Richard Then, the third son of the late Mdm Lee Ah Mooi. Mdm Khoo is not the only one in smiles. Others are singing and clapping. One resident, however, is gripping Mr Then’s hand instead – and crying. Mr Tan knows his target audience well. Earlier, he told CNA Insider what to expect: In the beginning, they’ll ignore you. Some will start to love your music, some will dance along, some will sing along, some will cry. Even a bedridden resident is responding to the music, moving his hands and feet. Mr Tan has seen this before as well, including among those on intravenous drip. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n His music has even brought tears out of patients in coma, which in one instance, he was told, came as a final relief before death. The irony is that his decision to bring joy to others came about after he was faced with the prospect of his own death five years ago, and which he narrowly avoided last year. Struck by an illness that is still dogging him and thinking that his days were numbered, Mr Tan, a welder, decided to make music as a busker. Now he is touching lives. WATCH: Transformed, and transforming lives (8:19)  A MOTHER’S GIFT Music has been his passion since young, and he thanks his late mother for that. Her love of singing had an indelible influence on him. “Whenever she was free after cooking, she used to sing,” recalled Mr Tan, one of eight children – four boys and four girls – born to a hawker and a housewife. “And each time she sang, I’d sit beside her.” But as they were poor, his parents could not afford music lessons or even a musical instrument for him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At the age of 17, he started working part-time as a shopkeeper and saved up to learn music. His first lesson was on the drums, which he had always wanted to play. By the time he was 19, he was drumming in bands in varied places, from pubs to street festivals for the seventh lunar month. It was not long before he began thinking, “How far can I go? I want to go up.” So he auditioned, successfully, for the Singapore Soka Association’s symphony band. For 18 years, he played for the Buddhist organisation, representing the country in international competitions and performing in big events locally, including four shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. He has also drummed for two-time Grammy winner and jazz artiste Shunzo Ohno, his “mentor”. But he never thought of making music his career, as that would have been “quite difficult” in Singapore. “I wanted to start a family. With a family, you’d need to have a daytime job,” said Mr Tan, who is married with two sons, aged 20 and 25. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That job that paid the bills was as a welder, first in the marine industry and then in aviation, spanning almost 30 years now. It was always music, however, that nourished his soul. Yet, for all he had accomplished musically, he had not quite fulfilled his mother’s words to him as a son enthralled by her singing. Use music to touch people’s hearts. That’s what my mum said. You can be a very good singer, but if your music doesn’t touch others, you’re not a good singer. Those words came flooding back to him during the “darkest moment” of his life. ‘WHY ME?’ In 2013, he started feeling fatigued and fell ill often. His company, ST Aerospace Engineering, sent him for blood tests, and that was when his life was turned upside down – even before he got the results. At the Singapore General Hospital where the tests would be done, he saw thank-you cards from the families of leukaemia patients – many who had died – and noticed other patients with shaven heads. He googled the disease and learnt that it was a type of blood cancer. He cried. What the doctors found, however, was lead in his blood and low blood cell counts, which had weakened his immune system. But they could not conclusively diagnose leukaemia, though they suspected related issues with his bone marrow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “The doctor said, ‘I can’t give you any medication. I don’t know what to request for you,’” said Mr Tan, who showed CNA Insider his medical reports. There was no medicine that could remove the lead in his blood either. For three months, his company put him on administrative duties. The thought that he may not have much time left ran through his mind. So did the question ‘why me’, many times. But eventually, it gave way to another question. “Why not take this opportunity to make my life more meaningful, and this period of time to make sure I can play music to touch people’s hearts?” he asked himself. I don’t make a lot of money. I’m not very well-educated. I think, maybe, this small part I can contribute to society. Then that’s why I said, ‘Okay, I’ll move on with this until the moment that I can’t play.’ Having played in many different places before, he knew that he wanted his music to move the man in the street most of all. So he thought of busking, also because it would not be the choice of many musicians. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It was not unlike what his mother used to do when she was young, during World War II. She told him that she used to sell flowers on the street and sing at the same time. If she could she see him busking now, he thinks it would bring tears to her eyes. NOT ANOTHER BEGGAR ON THE STREET Mr Tan’s sons were supportive. But he received a different reaction when he told his friends and bosses that he was auditioning for a busking licence. He said: You know what they told me? Oh my God, another beggar on the street. I was quite sad. The comment played on his mind. At his first busking location, Tampines, he thought of wearing a cap and sunglasses so that his colleagues, friends and relatives would not recognise him. In the end, he simply kept the volume of his music low. “I was so shy,” he admitted. But the encouragement of other buskers soon gave him the confidence he needed. “They came by and said, ‘You play good music, just that you’re not loud enough to capture passers-by,’” he recounted. “From that day, my whole concept of busking started to change.” His choice of musical instrument had also changed. Two years earlier, he bought an electronic wind instrument with seven octaves and about 100 built-in synthesiser sounds. Invented in Japan, it simulates the sound of various instruments, such as the flute, guitar, saxophone, trumpet, violin and drums, as well as voice. He took six months to master it. “There’s something different about this instrument. You can do a lot of magic,” he said. One of the things it has done is to help him cater for the musical tastes of the different generations, depending on his location. And slowly, he began to achieve his goal. He remembers the time when he was playing the Chinese song Endless Love, which reminded him of his mother, and “this aunty cried on the street”. I asked the aunty, ‘Why do you cry?’ The aunty said, ‘I cry because your music touched me. It reminded me of my late husband. Then there were occasions when people would come back and request the same songs. As he began to recognise his passers-by, he would play the tunes they liked. And the crowds grew. Outside City Hall MRT Station, one of his allocated sites, the crowd was so big once that the police came and asked him to move further away from the station exit. He said appreciatively: “When people start to enjoy my music, I feel that, oh my God, I’ve done something that moved their hearts.” PREPARING TO DIE Busking was giving Mr Tan purpose and satisfaction. But last year, his health robbed him of that. His fatigue wore him down to the point that he could no longer perform. He then found himself waking up at night, short of breath. In June, the results of a hospital check-up showed that his sleep disorder had to do with his respiratory system. Soon after, he had a thyroid issue that even turned his knuckles black. And within the span of a month, he began to feel numbness in his hands and feet. That last symptom called for a scan to detect whether he had any cancerous cells or growth. The result showed a lump near his groin. But the doctors could not be certain it was cancerous. “I cried because it wasn’t easy – one thing after another,” he said. And when he was referred to the National Cancer Centre for surgery, he went into a tailspin, just because of the word “cancer”. He became depressed. The operation would be a high-risk one, as the growth was very near a main blood vessel. And the doctor told him that two patients had died during this kind of operation because of bleeding. Not wanting to have the stress of living with the lump, however, he agreed to the surgery. Before the appointed date, he instructed his younger son: “If dad dies, this is the insurance you claim, this is my CPF.” Mr Tan also made a vow to keep if he survived the surgery. “I promised myself that I’d work much harder for music. I’d use music as therapy for those patients who need it more than me,” he said. Everyone lives with a mission. I hadn’t finished my mission. I didn’t want to die. He was conscious during the operation – and wanted to rejoice once the surgeon told him the entire growth had been removed. “I wanted to stand up and go out because my brother-in-law and sister were waiting for me … Just imagine, I was alive!” he said in his usual animated way. His sisters were a pillar of support for him, before and after the surgery, caring for him on his road to recovery. Although he wanted to return to busking, they ordered him to rest first. “I told him, ‘You should keep yourself all the more fit … because if you’re sick, you won’t be able to share enough (of your music),’” said sister Sharon. In all, their brother could not busk for 10 months last year. CHINATOWN’S PIED PIPER In January, Mr Tan was fired up again. And it marked the “turning point” of his busking journey, though not solely because of his recovery. With Chinese New Year approaching, he started busking at weekends in Chinatown – and found a group of young-at-heart seniors who still remember the district for its lively sights and sounds of old. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He became the spark that transformed their memories into relived experiences. The seniors came, they listened and they danced. Then they asked for more – for him to keep returning every weekend with his medley of melodies from the 1960s. Unless he has to perform at an event, he has obliged, even adding colourful lights to his set-up. “I believe some (older folks) can’t even afford to see a concert,” he said. “I just do my part to throw a mini-concert on the street for them.” Given their age profile, his usual night’s takings of about S$110 to S$120 is the lowest among the handful of sites where he can busk – about half of what he can possibly earn. But he stressed: “It’s not about money. I want to bring joy.” WATCH: The songs of yesteryear brought back (4:56)  He keeps going because of the difference in the seniors now. Describing what he saw before, he said: “They didn’t particularly have anything to do. They just sat down and watched people move about.” Still, he never expected the crowd to grow as big as it did, blocking an entire passageway along New Bridge Road at times.  Prior to CNA Insider’s earlier video on these street-jamming seniors, he had given out 400 name cards to them. In the three weeks since, more people have shown up, including youngsters who brought their parents. Wholesale otak-otak seller Hero Loh is already an avowed fan. “His music is very good. When you hear it, you feel comfortable,” said the 64-year-old. \"If he continues, then I’ll continue. Then we’ll have (dance) partners; then I’ll stay with him forever to dance.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Even as people seek out Mr Tan on the street, he has also been doing more to bring his music – a repertoire of 400 to 500 songs now – into the wards of nursing homes and hospitals. While he has been playing for patients for some years, the frequency has increased to about twice a month. And he wants to keep doing it for free. “It’s a blessing that I’m able to go and perform for them,” he said. “I believe music can heal. It’s a healing process.” His own health is under control so far. Every morning, he must take probiotics for his colon. He has medication for high cholesterol and also for oily blood, which he needs to dilute. His blood issues have yet to be resolved, though the lead content is coming down. And he did not have to fret about his hospital bills because of his company’s medical benefits. He still experiences fatigue, but his music is able to get him through it. “I have to psyche myself up and say I’m not sick, my blood is okay. This is how I change my mindset,” he said. “I still want to do more. I still think I can do more.” Know of any everyday heroes who are making an impact?

Judges awarded the five-round bout to the 21-year-old Lee - who represents Singapore - in a unanimous decision, as she cast aside doubts about her fitness following a long absence from the cage. It was an emotional return for Lee after a car accident kept her out for about a year. Her last fight was in May last year. But Lee’s opponent in her first match back could hardly have been tougher. Yamaguchi, 35, again displayed the kind of tenacity that saw the pair go to five rounds in their first title bout back in 2016. “Mei is an incredibly tough opponent,” Lee said immediately after her win. “It’s a huge night for my family.” The fight started evenly as both fighters traded blows on the mat. Lee however moved into a slight advantage, using her superior physique to try and pin her rival into submission. But as the rounds rung by Yamaguchi grew into the match, and in the final round she landed a kick that sent Lee flying to the ground. The crowd gasped then cheered as Lee recovered to ensure a frantic finish. In the end it was not enough for the diminutive Yamaguchi, who said afterwards that she thought she had done enough to level the points. “Angela got some position on me but I thought I caught up with that knockdown,” she said. “But the decision still went to her, so I think that was a point for a champion.” Nevertheless, Yamaguchi said she’s not giving up on the title just yet. “I heard that (Angela) is going up the weight division, so maybe I can challenge for the title again,” she added. “I’ll keep training and getting stronger.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/mma-angela-lee-defeats-mei-yamaguchi-again-one-championship-10248862"}, {"datetime": "18 May 2018 09:16PM", "tags": ["A*STAR"], "author": "Cheryl Goh", "title": "50% spike in research investments with A*STAR, more R&D by local firms", "content": " SINGAPORE: Companies invested S$340 million in research and development with The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in the last financial year, a 50 per cent spike from FY2016, it revealed at its year-in-review briefing on Friday (May 18). Of these, a third came from local enterprises, the agency said. “More significantly, R&D spending by local enterprises outpaced this increase, growing by around two-thirds from S$61 million to S$102 million,” said A*STAR chairman Lim Chuan Poh. The agency worked on more than 2,100 research projects last year, an increase of 20 per cent from FY2016. Three-quarters of more than 260 A*STAR licences were also taken up by local enterprises in FY2017, compared to about 60 per cent of 235 in FY2016. “This has been a very good year for A*STAR, but much more importantly, it is good because our local enterprises have really stepped up, in terms of leveraging research, to make their business competitive,” Mr Lim added. NEW VENTURE IN SILICON PHOTONICS At the briefing, A*STAR also revealed its latest venture, a new spin-off called the Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF), a specialty commercial foundry with an expertise in silicon photonics technology. The technology will allow, for example, a large 50 gigabyte file to be transmitted “within one second” with the use of silicon photonics and fibre optics, explained Professor Tan  Sze Wee, executive director of A*STAR’s Science and Engineering Research Council.

While other foundries may produce hundreds of thousands of wafers a month, AMF will only be manufacturing about 10,000 a year. The customisable chips can be used in areas such as 5G data communication, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. “They are very specialised products and hence very high value,” he said. “It enables data to be processed at the speed of light.” AMF currently has secured investments that value the company at around US$300 million.

The Vulnerable Adults Bill defines such individuals as those aged 18 years or older who - because of mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity - are not able to protect themselves. During the Second Reading of the Bill, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee said that the bill seeks to protect individuals from, among other things, physical, psychological and emotional abuse and neglect such as deprivation of necessities. It also seeks to protect against self-neglect, which could see vulnerable adults end up living in \"grossly\" unsanitary or hazardous conditions. The Bill empowers the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to enter private premises and to assess a possibly vulnerable adult, if there is reason to believe that the individual was, is, or is at risk of experiencing abuse, neglect or self-neglect. MSF may also remove vulnerable adults from their residence and commit them to gazetted care facilities, or to the care of a fit person. “I wish to assure members that committals to these care facilities will only be done as a last resort, for an appropriate duration, until the vulnerable adult can be safely reunited with his family,” Mr Lee said. BILL REQUIRES FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO STEP FORWARD The effectiveness of the Bill, however, is dependent on those who meet and interact with vulnerable individuals stepping forward to raise alarm bells for community agencies and the authorities to intervene, Mr Lee said. He cited the example of the “horrible and tragic” case of Annie Ee, an intellectually disabled waitress who died after eight months of abuse by her flatmates. He also brought up another case in which help was provided after neighbours sounded the alert when they saw a 68-year-old early-stage dementia patient walking around with bruises. The Family Service Centre (FSC) found that the daughter of the patient, identified as Madam Chua, would beat her mother every time the elderly woman soiled herself or left the stove on. Social workers found out that the daughter was remorseful, and that her anger stemmed from frustration and stress from dealing with her mother’s failing health and a special needs son. The daughter agreed to participate in counselling and assistance programmes to help her manage Madam Chua’s failing mental and physical health. Since the FSC’s involvement, there have not been further incidents of violence, Mr Lee added.  “Cases such as this remind us of the complexity of family relationships, and the crucial role that family and community intervention plays in helping vulnerable individuals,” Mr Lee said. BILL PROTECTS WHISTLE-BLOWERS AND PROFESSIONALS \"Whistle-blowers will be protected from civil and criminal liability, as long as they had acted with reasonable care and in good faith,\" Mr Lee said, adding that professionals such as doctors, lawyers and counsellors will also not be regarded to have breached any professional etiquette or ethics. In order for swift action to be taken by agencies to protect the vulnerable adult and hold perpetrators accountable, confidential information relating to a vulnerable adult may also be shared among agencies where necessary, Mr Lee said.  MEMBERS QUESTION SCOPE OF BILL, POWERS TO INSTITUTIONALISE Members unanimously supported the Bill, but asked for clarifications. Workers’ Party MP Sylvia Lim and MP for Jalan Besar GRC Denise Phua raised concerns on how the government will exercise its power to institutionalise vulnerable adults. “Before the State exercises its drastic powers of intervention, I would expect that a case by case, subjective assessment would have to be made,” Ms Lim said. Being institutionalised generally comes with a loss of pride and a loss of autonomy, having to live by an institution’s rules, she added. In response, Mr Lee said that the individual's state will be assessed by a qualified person. A \"mental capacity\" form that is in the works will first have to be filled up. He added that the situation will be assessed holistically.  Members also asked why financial abuse was not included in the definition of abuse. The Bill refers to abuse as emotional, physical or psychological abuse. Among members who questioned the exclusion of financial abuse were Nominated Member of Parliament Chia Yong Yong, Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo and MP for Marine Parade GRC Seah Kian Peng. Financial abuse is under-reported, due to its \"subtle, non-tangible nature\" said Mr Seah. Quoting a 2014 study by Trans Safe Centre, which deals with abuse against the elderly, he said that one in three cases of such abuse was of a financial nature.  The government can intervene if financial abuse occurs alongside neglect and abuse covered under the Bill , Mr Lee said in response. He also said that other family members do step forward to prevent financial exploitation. \"Let us gain more experience in operationalising this vulnerable adult protection framework while we continue to study this complex issue of financial exploitation of family members,\" he added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bill-allowing-state-to-intervene-and-protect-vulnerable-adults-10247408"}, {"datetime": "18 May 2018 06:00PM", "tags": ["Central Narcotics Bureau"], "author": "", "title": "138 suspected drug offenders arrested in 11-day operation ", "content": " SINGAPORE: A total of 138 suspected drug offenders were arrested after an 11-day operation by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), said the drug enforcement agency in a news release on Friday (May 18).

The study, conducted by Frost and Sullivan, showed that only about 20 per cent of that damage was caused by the direct impact of a cyberattack on a company's financials, as a result of things such as fines and remediation costs. The majority of the loss, or 64 per cent, was because of an “induced loss”. This was defined by the research firm as the impact of a cyber breach on the broader ecosystem and economy. By comparison, the economic loss from cyberattacks for Asia Pacific as a whole was US$1.75 trillion (S$2.3 trillion) last year, the findings showed. The breakdown for the region was 10 per cent for direct loss, 30 per cent for indirect loss - referring to opportunity cost such as reputation loss leading to customer churn and job losses - and 60 per cent for induced loss, according to Frost and Sullivan.  Mr Edison Yu, vice president and Asia Pacific head of Enterprise for Frost and Sullivan, said during the presentation of the report that while direct losses from these breaches are most apparent, they are “but the tip of the iceberg”. As such, its study came up with an economic loss model that looked to include other aspects such as job loss and customer churn due to damage to a company’s reputation. For a large-sized organisation of more than 500 employees in Singapore, Mr Yu said, the economic damage from a cybersecurity incident was, on average, US$13.8 million (S$18.5 million). A deeper look into this figure, however, showed that the direct loss - which includes things such as productivity loss and customer disruption - amounted to US$2.7 million. Induced loss accounted for US$7.7 million, and indirect loss was US$3.4 million. When a cyberattack occurs, jobs too are placed at risk. The study showed that cyberattacks resulted in job losses across different functions in 57 per cent of Singapore organisations that had an incident over the last 12 months.  Elaborating, Mr Yu said that jobs may become redundant if the company has to close down the business unit affected by the attack. The study, commissioned by the US tech giant, surveyed 1,300 respondents from 13 Asia Pacific markets including Singapore. The respondents included business and IT decision-makers involved in the shaping of their companies’ cybersecurity strategies. DATA CORRUPTION, BRAND IMPERSONATION BIGGEST HEADACHES The study also found that while cyberattacks such as ransomware have hogged the headlines recently, it is actually fraudulent wire transfer, data corruption, online brand impersonation and data exfiltration (the ability to get data out from an organisation) that are most concerning for companies that have suffered attacks. These are the “silent killers” for companies as they have the highest impact with the slowest recovery time, Mr Yu explained. “They may be invisible to the organisations,” he added. Yet, even as the ramifications of cyberattacks have proven to be evident, the study found that of the Asia Pacific companies that have suffered a cyberattack, only 25 per cent had considered cybersecurity before starting a digital transformation project. By comparison, 34 per cent of organisations that have not suffered a cyberattack do so, it added. “The rest of the organisations either think about cybersecurity only after they start on the project or do not consider it at all,” the study said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/cyberattack-billions-singapore-firms-economic-losses-microsoft-10247312"}, {"datetime": "18 May 2018 05:30PM", "tags": ["Mediacorp", "media"], "author": "", "title": "Mediacorp appoints Debra Soon as Chief Marketing Officer, Irene Lim as Chief Customer Officer", "content": " SINGAPORE: Mediacorp on Friday (May 18) announced the appointment of media veteran Debra Soon as Chief Marketing Officer, a newly created role to lead the company’s new integrated marketing organisation.

Mr Khaw was responding to parliamentary questions from MP for Nee Soon GRC Lee Bee Wah and Non-Constituency MP Dennis Tan on whether rail reliability and service standards can be captured in the new fare formula which determines how much commuters pay for public transport.  The new public transport fare formula, slated to kick in at the end of this year, does not factor in reliability and service standards. But Mr Khaw said he will personally \"see to it\" that operators maintain such standards.  \"Even though it's not in the fare formula, I deal with it directly myself through the sort of focus and pressure I exert on the operators to make sure the rail reliability is brought about because that is my priority. And I'll see to it that it happens, whether or not it's included in the fare formula,\" he said.  Mr Tan had suggested adding a reliability component to the fare formula to penalise operators through lower fares for not performing up to standard. But this could worsen the situation, Mr Khaw said. \"When a system is very unreliable, in fact that is the time to pump in more resources ... and if you punish them through reduced fares, you are withdrawing resources from the operators and you'll be doing exactly the opposite. The wrong thing. Rail reliability is important but deal with it separately,\" Mr Khaw said.  He brought up the example of the early closure late opening engineering maintenance and rectification programme which started late last year and said that the programme has \"shown results\" and improved the reliability of the North-South Line significantly.  NOT POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT WITHOUT RESOURCES: KHAW Mr Khaw also said that the new fare formula announced in March includes a new component, the Network Capacity Factor (NCF), which addresses service standards, although indirectly. \"For example, if we do not expand the rail network but demand grows, as it happened a few years back, resulting in crowded trains, then the NCF will be negative.

If things improve through more comfortable rides but costs go up, then the factor is positive,\" Mr Khaw said. \"Service levels may not be picked up directly through the fare formula but the sentiments will be picked up by me very quickly, because engineer Lee Bee Wah will make sure that I fully understood what is happening on the ground. And I'm very attentive, of course not just to Yishun but the whole Singapore,\" Mr Khaw added.  Mr Khaw stressed that it is not possible to improve the public transport system without pumping in resources to recruit more manpower such as bus and train drivers, engineers, technicians and mechanicians.  \"All those things come with money and I really hope Singaporeans understand that I want to do my job well so that we can have a first-class transport system and we will get there.  \"But I do need money because it is not realistic to hope that you get a first-class, reliable train with no need of any injection of resources,\" Mr Khaw said.  The funding would have to come from \"either taxpayers through subsidies or commuters through fares\", he said, adding that the PTC has been tasked to balance the interest of both sides.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/khaw-boon-wan-mrt-public-transport-reliability-parliament-10246668"}, {"datetime": "18 May 2018 03:51PM", "tags": ["Singapore identity", "Indranee Rajah"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Singaporean identity 'particularly pertinent' in new global situation: Indranee", "content": " SINGAPORE: The question of the Singapore identity is “particularly pertinent” as a new global situation is emerging, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah said in Parliament on Friday (May 18).  Global changes she cited include the rise of China, the \"introspection\" of America and the political sea change in Malaysia. She also mentioned economic shifts, such as how technology is disrupting old jobs and creating new ones, as well as social issues like income inequality and an ageing population. Responding to the President’s address, Ms Indranee, who is also Second Minister for Finance, Education and Law, said that Singapore’s ability to deal with these challenges around the world goes “to the very heart of our identity”. \"Do we, this generation of Singaporeans, have what it takes to deal with these challenges and come out ahead? In this time of change, what anchors us? Who are we and what do we stand for? What kind of future do we want to make for ourselves?\" she said. Ms Indranee then highlighted values and defining characteristics that make up the Singaporean identity. She first spoke on Singapore’s pursuit of excellence and exceptionalism, especially given its small size and lack of natural resources. “If we want anyone to pay attention to us, if we want to have a place at an international table, if we are to secure our position in the world, then we have to be better than merely good,” Ms Indranee said. She cited how the country has excelled as an aviation hub, with Changi Airport voted the world’s best for six consecutive years and Singapore Airlines awarded the number one airline globally by Tripadvisor. Ms Indranee also highlighted how Singapore has performed exceptionally in music and sport, citing how it has produced child prodigies such as 11-year-old violinist Chloe Chua as well as swimmer Joseph Schooling who won the country’s first Olympic gold medal.    \"TO BE SINGAPOREAN IS TO CARE\" But Ms Indranee stressed that being Singaporean is “not just about achievements”, and that the triumphs are the \"manifestations of something much deeper and more fundamental\".  \"Above all, to be Singaporean is to care ... about family, about others, about country,” she said.  She added that the debate for the presidential address highlighted various problems such as social mobility, inequality and the lack of social mixing but \"the real point to note is that we care that it is becoming a problem and we are determined to do something about it\".   \"That is the essence of being Singaporean. We care enough to want to do something. If we see something wrong, our first instinct is to help, to fix it, to improve the situation,” she said. Ms Indranee added that Singaporeans love the environment and nature, highlighting how the country has become a “City in a Garden” with green spaces such as UNESCO world heritage site Botanical Gardens, Gardens by the Bay and the upcoming Rainforest Park at Mandai.  She highlighted how Singaporeans love animals, and cited how the Facebook page Campus Creatures featuring animals around schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and universities has gained popularity. Ms Indranee also talked about how much food is a defining characteristic of the Singapore identity. “Before we have finished one meal, we are discussing the next,” she said. “We have our traditional hawker food but young Singaporeans are coming up with creative new concepts.” To illustrate her point, Ms Indranee cited successful enterprises such as Windowsill Pies, set up by brothers Jonathan and Sean Gwee as well as salted egg yolk fish skin and chips from Golden Duck by Singaporean duo Jonathan Shen and Christopher Hwang. However, Ms Indranee added that Singaporeans are “by no means perfect” and that some of the characteristics of the Singapore identity are negative. She cited how Singaporeans are “champion complainers”, kiasu, impatient and can sometimes be inconsiderate and selfish. Despite this, Ms Indranee maintained that the positive attributes of the Singaporean identity far outweigh the negative ones. In concluding her speech, Ms Indranee urged young Singaporeans to help write the next chapter of the Singapore story.  “Earlier generations have done much. Now it is your turn. You have the qualities, the values and the opportunity to do so,\" she said.  “No matter what our background, each of us has a role to play, each has something to contribute to make Singapore a better place. As in an orchestra, each instrument taken alone may not sound very musical, but together they produce a soaring symphony,” Ms Indranee added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singaporean-identity-indranee-rajah-parliament-10246598"}, {"datetime": "18 May 2018 02:45PM", "tags": ["Heng Swee Keat"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "4G leaders to engage Singaporeans in series of discussions to chart future together: Heng Swee Keat", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore's fourth-generation political leaders plan to kick-start a series of discussions to engage all segments of society and will listen to the people's views on charting the future \"with humility and respect”, said Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on Friday (May 18). In what he described as a “Whole-of-Singapore effort”, the discussions will see the 4G leaders sharing their ideas while seeking the population’s views on them.  “We will partner Singaporeans each step of the way in our journey of building our future Singapore,” said Mr Heng.  “The fourth generation leadership will listen with humility and respect. We will consider all views with an open mind, and adjust our course accordingly.  “We will communicate the thinking behind our decisions clearly. We will bring Singaporeans together and give everyone a role to turn good ideas into concrete action,” he added.  While more details will be provided after the Government has taken stock of the views shared in this week’s parliamentary debate on the President’s Address, Mr Heng said the discussions aim to engage Singaporeans at different stages of life and segments of society.  “Through our discussions, we will share our ideas and seek your views,” he said. “We will build trust and ambition for Singapore, and foster a common purpose. We will galvanise action and partnerships across society towards our common goals.”  BRING OUT BEST IN PEOPLE, BUILD CULTURE OF PARTNERSHIP AND TRUST With his speech centred around fostering close partnerships between the Government and its people, Mr Heng mentioned two “vital parts” that would take Singapore and Singaporeans into the future.  He first talked about how the Government will continue bringing out the best in its people, which he described as “the central question that should occupy each generation of leaders”. This is not just about helping Singaporeans to make the grade or make a living. Rather, it is about supporting Singaporeans to make a good life and to make a difference, he said.  The Government must also continue to find ways to respect, encourage and support Singaporeans to give expression to their values.  For instance, through education and philanthropic programmes, or platforms like the Global Innovation Alliance that allow people to venture out into the world, innovate and create value.  “Our goal is to spark Singaporeans’ sense of wonder and curiosity when young. We want to fire up their passion to explore and discover, and encourage them to invent and innovate throughout their lives.”  “We should move away from an overemphasis on grades,” added Mr Heng. “Build on the strengths and interests of each child, and develop each to his or her fullest potential. We must strive for multiple ladders of success, multiple peaks of excellence.”  “This will take time, but we must continue to persevere,” he said.  On building a culture of partnership and trust, Mr Heng said this is vital to “keep Singapore a special place for all of us”.  “Unity matters,” he stressed. “Other countries watch us. If there are divisions, these will be exploited … If we stand united, we stand tall among nations.”  Referring to President Halimah Yacob’s call to foster a deeper people-government partnership, Mr Heng said this partnership “must be sincere and grounded in trust, with all stakeholders playing meaningful and complementary roles”.  “Each generation of leaders has worked to strengthen the people-and-government and people-to-people partnerships, building trust between Government and the people and between all parts of our society.  “At critical junctures, we came together to chart our course for the future,” he said. “The fourth generation political leadership is committed to building this partnership, and growing the trust.”  Mr Heng noted that the public is interested in how the 4G political leadership is taking shape but to build new ideas, new bonds, and new connections, leadership must be developed in all parts of the society.  This is because as challenges become more complex, “the Government will not have all the solutions”.  There will be the need to harness the diverse strengths of the society, “through leaders at different levels”. “By working together, we can achieve something greater than the sum of our parts,” he said.  And that goes beyond political leadership, added Mr Heng, noting that this will need to be developed and embraced in every part of society from unions and trade associations, to non-government organisations and voluntary welfare organisations.  For instance, contributions from leaders in business, unions and academia have “energised and strengthened” the Committee on the Future Economy, and now the Future Economy Council. Partnership and trust must also be extended beyond Singapore. With Singapore assuming the rotating chairmanship for ASEAN this year, Mr Heng said it will use this opportunity to work together with its neighbours and work towards a more integrated, innovative and resilient ASEAN.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/4g-leaders-to-engage-singaporeans-in-series-of-discussions-to-10246704"}, {"datetime": "18 May 2018 01:34PM", "tags": ["Chan Chun Sing", "Trade tariffs"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "'Limited' impact from US-China tariffs on Singapore economy, says Chan Chun Sing", "content": " SINGAPORE: The tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China have had \"limited\" negative impact on Singapore’s economy as they affect only a “modest share” of the country’s exports, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in Parliament on Friday (May 18). An analysis by his ministry estimated that about 0.09 per cent of Singapore’s domestic exports could be directly affected by the trade tariffs, Mr Chan said. Still, the Government is closely monitoring developments, particularly for any indirect impact on firms and workers over the longer term, he said. Economic agencies are also in close contact with companies that may be affected. Mr Chan, who took over the helm at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) this month following the latest Cabinet reshuffle, said he has also called for an in-depth study to be done on the possible implications of a trade war. One direct implication is rising costs for businesses, but even if tariffs are not targeted at Singapore, there could also be a \"knock-on impact\" as global trade flows shift, he said. Tariffs targeted at other countries affect the trade flows between and among these countries, which could also affect Singapore, he explained in his reply to a question from West Coast GRC Member of Parliament Patrick Tay. “Whether it’s positive, negative or to what extent, we will need to study this carefully,\" he said. “It requires us to review our economic models to make sure we understand the shifts in the trade flows and ask ourselves what other actions do we need to ... safeguard ourselves from these uncertainties.”  For instance, Singapore can not become overly dependent on any particular market and must continue to “expand and diversify”, he said. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on varying items including steel, aluminium and solar panels – aimed chiefly at China and has threatened more on other Chinese goods. In retaliation, China announced a list of counter-tariffs on a variety of US exports, such as crops and aircraft.  A Chinese delegation is currently in Washington for talks with top US administration officials, following a separate round of negotiations in Beijing earlier this month. Mr Chan said Singapore has registered its concerns with US and China, and continues to engage the relevant departments. With the country being a strong proponent of free trade and supporter of the rules-based multilateral trading system, Singapore remains concerned that an \"escalating cycle of expanding unilateral tariff measures will result in negative spill-over effects on global supply chains\". “Any disruption to global trade flows or trade volumes will affect big and small economies alike.

This will ensure closer product and service consistency across the SIA Group’s full-service network, the company said.  Aircraft cabin upgrades are expected to start in 2020 \"due to lead times required by seat suppliers, including to complete certification processes\", according to Singapore Airlines.  The merger will take place only after a sufficient number of aircraft have been fitted with the new cabin products, and specific details will be announced progressively as the programme develops and timelines are finalised, it added.  There will also be transfers of routes and aircraft between the different airlines in the portfolio, which Singapore Airlines said was \"consistent with ongoing efforts to optimise the SIA Group’s network\".  Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong called the announcement a \"significant development to provide more growth opportunities and prepare the Group for an even stronger future\".  The changes will be \"positive\" for customers, Mr Goh, adding that it was a major investment to ensure that Singapore Airlines' products and services continue to lead the industry across short, medium and long-haul routes.  NO JOB CUTS Speaking at the carrier’s results briefing, Mr Goh also said the merger between Singapore Airlines and SilkAir is not a \"consolidation exercise\".  He said the SilkAir brand is not as well known in areas like Europe compared to here in Asia and as such, the merger will allow SIA to better position the brand in those regions. “SilkAir has always played a critical role for SIA as a regional feeder. Even with the merger, it won’t detract from that role. However, we believe that with the merger and one single brand, it will make it much easier for customers to understand that both narrow body and wide body (planes) belong to the same organisation and brand.\" \"That is not to say there is no place for SilkAir,\" Mr Goh told media and analysts at the briefing. \"In fact there is still a lot of demand for SilkAir type of service specifically on the bigger destinations, bigger cities in Southeast Asia.\" He also said that no employee will be made \"redundant\". “Our view is that with the integration and the growth opportunity, there should be more opportunities for our staff to go into different roles,\" he said.  \"However, where there are overlaps, we will look at how to redeploy staff and also how to provide re-training. This is not something new for us, we have gone through mergers between Tiger and Scoot.\" Mr Goh also clarified that when the merger is successfully completed, SilkAir will no longer exist as an airline or brand. SilkAir operates a fleet of 11 Airbus A320-family aircraft, 22 Boeing 737-800 and 737 MAX 8 aircraft. It is currently transitioning to an all-737 fleet, and serves 49 destinations in 16 countries, according to Singapore Airlines.  JUMP IN PROFIT The move comes as Singapore Airlines undertakes a three-year transformation programme designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers. Singapore Airlines on Thursday topped market expectations by reporting a 150 per cent rise in full-year net profit to the highest level since 2011, as passenger and cargo revenue rose and the transformation programme produced early results. But SilkAir was a weak spot, reporting a full-year operating profit of S$43 million for the 12 months ended March 31, down 57 per cent from a year earlier. The cabin upgrade will close a gap with rival Cathay Pacific Airways, whose regional arm, Cathay Dragon, operates jets with cabins more similar to its parent than the wider gulf between Singapore Airlines and SilkAir products. \"Upgrading the narrowbody product and folding SilkAir into Singapore Airlines is sensible and was inevitable,\" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. \"The product gap between SilkAir and Singapore Airlines has become too wide.\" As part of its transformation programme, Singapore Airlines had already handed some of SilkAir's routes to budget carrier Scoot and merged part of SilkAir's finance team with its parent.  Additional reporting by Brandon Tanoto.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/silkair-to-be-merged-with-singapore-airlines-after-cabin-revamp-10245300"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 09:16PM", "tags": ["SCDF", "Kok Yuen Chin"], "author": "", "title": "'We will work hard to regain your trust': SCDF after death of NSF", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Thursday (May 17) expressed its sorrow at the death of full-time national serviceman (NSF) Kok Yuen Chin, and vowed to do \"everything necessary\" to help his family. \"We mourn the heart-breaking loss of one of our own, NSF firefighter CPL Kok Yuen Chin,\" said SCDF in a Facebook post. \"We will do everything necessary to assist his family during this difficult period.

There were calls to ramp up infrastructure for the elderly and to help retired individuals who live in private homes. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the Member of Parliament for the Bukit Panjang constituency, said the Government needs to expedite the transformation of Singapore's built environment to be more elderly friendly. “Although various developments are in place to support ageing, there is an urgent need to make every home to be elder safe, every community to be elder safe, and make Singapore to be an elder safe country for both Singaporeans and tourists,\" he said.  He suggested that the Ministry of National Development (MND) provide standard elderly-friendly solutions such as ramps, grab bars, anti-slip flooring, alert systems and lightings to encourage more families to make their homes elder safe. He also recommended that Singapore’s built environment be 100 per cent seamless and barrier free. “At present, many buildings and places do not have barrier-free access. Our public transport system is also not fully integrated to provide seamless travel for all seniors and wheelchair-bound commuters,\" he said.  MP for the Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC Alex Yam said that the Government should consider installing home monitoring systems, as well as lower wash areas and kitchen tops for elderly. HOUSING TYPES NOT A GOOD MEASURE OF WHO GETS BENEFITS MP for Mountbatten Lim Biow Chuan asked if the Government would consider reviewing the policy of tagging budget benefits to household types. He added that there are Singaporeans who live in private homes or bigger HDB flats but many are retired with no income or struggle to find similar paying jobs due to their age. “Their frustration is that they always get left behind whenever benefits are announced in the annual budget. It is a non-event for them because the SG Bonus, GST vouchers or S&CC or utilities rebates are usually not for them,” Mr Lim said. Consequently, these Singaporeans feel that the Government has little appreciation for residents living in better homes despite their past years of contribution to nation building when they were working, Mr Lim added. Mr Lim stressed that he is not suggesting “simply giving handouts” but to better appreciate those who had contributed to Singapore by paying income taxes and had served Singapore in different capacities. “I urge the Government to adopt policies which signal to our citizens that they are appreciated for their contributions to nation building. This will give them a sense that they are Singaporeans too when the Budget is announced,” he said. Mr Lim also asked if the Government will review the tagging of Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) benefits to the cardholder’s household income. He gave the example of a resident who lost his CHAS medical benefits after getting a small pay raise of S$100, and ended up having to pay more for medical care because the resident is now overqualified. “It does not make sense why the CHAS system penalises someone for working harder and earning more. A graduated system would be fairer to those who really need the CHAS benefits,” Mr Lim said. ISSUE OF LEASE DECAY HAS RESURFACED  Mr Yam also spoke about how the issue of 99-year leases for HDB flats has “resurfaced in recent months”.  He highlighted that given the recent collective sale frenzy, lease decay has led to the unfortunate comparison of different types of housing. “That a 20-year old private apartment or a 40-year old HUDC can undergo collective sale and thus monetise the asset seems unfair. Of course, there are major differences between both. But there can be no amount of rational explanation that can address the perceived unfairness completely,” Mr Yam said.   He called for “more clarity” from MND on the issue and suggested that a modified Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) be expanded. Workers’ Party’s Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Leon Perera added that HDB flat lease decay is a “large and complex issue” that WP intends to study with a view of making constructive suggestions. He highlighted that there was a possibility of HDB resale prices performing poorly in the future as more BTO flats are built. He added that there is a pressure on residents to monetise their HDB flats for future retirement income or even emergency or supplementary income. REVIEW POLICIES ON RESERVES  Separately, Mr Perera suggested that the Government tap more from its reserves to bolster its budget. “Such changes would not reduce the absolute size of the reserves per se but would slow down the rate of reserve growth,” he said. “This question is not only a technical economic question but a deep, philosophical question about inter-generational equity.\" Mr Perera added that there are reasonable views on both sides of the issue. On one hand, not tapping on the reserves would allow Singapore to gain additional security from a larger and larger emergency fund going forward.  On the other hand, there are risks from allowing costs and economic pressures to rise in the future, he warned. \"Spending more on the current generations and reducing the cost burden may affect TFR (Total Fertility Rate),\" he said. \"There is some evidence that anxiety about the cost of living and academic competition contributes to a low TFR, and indeed our TFR is one of the lowest in the world.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/debate-on-president-address-mps-infrastructure-housing-issues-10243862"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 07:36PM", "tags": ["Singapore Airlines", "SIA", "earnings"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore Airlines reports 150% jump in full-year profit", "content": " SINGAPORE: National carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) on Thursday (May 17) topped market expectations by reporting a 148 per cent rise in full-year net profit to the highest level since 2011, as passenger and cargo revenue rose and it benefited from a transformation programme. The carrier, a benchmark for Asia's premium airlines, made S$893 million in the year ended March, up from S$360 million a year ago and 28 per cent higher than the S$697 million average forecast from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

There will be three key aspirations that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will explore in the new LTMP. Firstly, a seamless land transport system that can easily integrate new and innovative mobility solutions as they emerge. Dr Puthucheary said that the land transport industry has seen various disruptive technologies such as car-sharing services like Grab and Uber as well as bike-sharing services like ofo, Mobike and oBike. “Who knows what’s going to happen in the next five years? Whatever comes along, we need to find a way … we need to design our public transport system such that whatever comes along will be easily integrated and part of the solution,” Dr Puthucheary said.   He gave the example of multi-modal commutes that involve more than one type of public transport. “Perhaps a shared bike to the MRT station. The MRT takes you to a destination at which point you have a point-to-point car waiting for you that will take you eventually to your place of work. That journey should ideally be seen as one journey as opposed to three separate journeys,” he said. Such journeys can also be paid for it with one payment solution, he added. The second key aspiration is to cater to diverse needs of all commuter groups and empower all to use the transport system independently. “In light of changing mobility challenges and changing demographics … this is going to have an impact on resource and resource allocation. How do we do this in a way that’s fair and feels just to Singaporeans?” he said. The last key aspiration is to develop stronger connectivity to regional centres such as Woodlands, Jurong and Punggol and Tampines to bring jobs and daily essential activities closer to home.

An outstanding city is not just economically attractive but also inclusive, a place that embraces diversity, where different social groups mix and have equal opportunities to participate, he added. He said Singapore has worked hard to avoid problems faced by other cities such as the deterioration of areas outside of the downtown core, and segregation of neighbourhoods- between the rich and poor, ethnic groups and young and old. Every HDB town has a balanced mix of residents across different ethnic groups and backgrounds, a mix of public-private developments, as well as different HDB flat types catering to diverse needs, Mr Wong said. There are also common spaces where residents of different backgrounds can socialise and amenities like shops, hawker centres and playgrounds where people can get together no matter who they are, he said. TAKING CARE OF THE LOWER-INCOME AND ELDERLY Singapore cannot just leave things to chance, but deliberately plan for a more equal and inclusive society. This is why the Government has been building more rental flats with newer, better designs, alongside the sold flats in various HDB towns. “This means that families grow up in the same neighbourhood, and the residents share the same common areas and facilities,” he said. He added that the Government is going one step further to integrate rental and sold units within the same HDB block. “We’ve done well in the last 50 years, but more still needs to be done,” he said. He pointed to almost 1,000 households moving out of rental flats to become homeowners as a result of efforts to help families in such residences. To improve the situation further, his ministry will be working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Social Services Office and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to explore how it can support the families, help them solve their issues holistically and get back on their feet. In order to take care of another segment of society, the elderly, especially those living on their own in studio and 2-room flexi apartments, MND is putting a “lot more emphasis in the way we design our HDB flats and estates”, he said. This means more shared public spaces, like civic plazas and community gardens, for them to stay active, and more community services and amenities under one roof, for convenient access “We don’t want them to feel isolated and disengaged,” he said. INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES CONTINUAL RENEWAL Another aspect of inclusive development is to continually renew buildings and infrastructure, Mr Wong said. “We don’t want a situation where certain parts of Singapore are left to degrade and we end up with deteriorated neighbourhoods or towns, inhabited largely by lower-income or elderly residents,” he said. However, he said this is not just a matter for the Government, but a shared responsibility. Town Councils need to ensure proper maintenance and upkeeping of the estate, and residents need to take care of the neighbourhood, he said. MND has put in place several programmes for estate renewal, such as the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme, he said. Addressing calls for the extension of these programmes, Mr Wong said upgrading projects are expensive, and span many years “We have to study this carefully to make sure we have the resources to follow through on any future commitments,” he said. RESILIENCE IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT Besides being more innovative and inclusive, the Government also has to incorporate resilience in urban development, Mr Wong said. A big unknown is whether the planet can continue to sustain economic activities. “If the world does not do enough to tackle climate change, Singapore will be at risk of coastal inundation due to sea level rises,” he said. Speaking about preparations to strengthen Singapore’s resilience against climate change, he highlighted the polder development in Pulau Tekong. The dike system in the polder is designed to cater for a sea-level rise. The dike can also be raised and upgraded more easily compared to traditional reclamation. The Government is also studying how best to safeguard Singapore’s long-term coastal protection needs by undertaking detailed modelling and engineering studies and recommending appropriate protection strategies, he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/housing-and-urban-plans-must-be-inclusive-and-resilient-lawrence-10243284"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 06:12PM", "tags": ["traffic accident"], "author": "Low Zoey", "title": "Accident involving 3 lorries, 2 buses on AYE; students taken to hospital ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Three teenagers were injured after three lorries and two buses collided on the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) on Thursday (May 17).

Speaking during the debate on the President’s address, he said there have been concerns about the impact of lease expiry on HDB resale prices.  Quoting transaction data over the past year, he said that an older 4-room flat with less than 60 years remaining on its 99-year lease would sell for around S$300,000 and a 5-room would sell for around S$400,000 in non-mature estates.  For flats in more popular locations, prices can be significantly higher, he added. “So the transacted price depends not just on length of remaining lease, clearly, but also many other attributes,” he said, adding that factors like location, storey height, and the condition of the flat are all relevant. Whatever the price, the sales proceeds would be “more than sufficient” to purchase a smaller flat, he said.  He gave the example of 67-year-old Abdul Aziz Haji Hamdan, who owned a 3-room flat in Marsiling with around 60 years remaining on the lease, and moved to a studio apartment in Kampung Admiralty with a 30-year lease.  His S$250,000 sales proceeds were more than sufficient to cover the purchase price of more than $100,000, and provided excess in cash and CPF proceeds, supplementing his retirement savings, he said.  He harked back to the time when people were speculating in older HDB flats hoping to benefit from the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).  “Now the reverse has happened, and there are people overly anxious about how much their older flats can fetch in the resale market,” he said.  SINGAPORE STILL SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY SPACE Addressing calls by some to allow automatic lease extensions or lease top-ups by private developers for older HDB flats, which mostly have more than 60 years remaining on their leases, Mr Wong said: “It will be easy for me to give you a politically expedient answer now and try to wave away the problem, but there are serious trade-offs and ramifications to consider.” This is because Singapore is still severely constrained by space, despite the Government’s best efforts at planning, he said. He questioned what would happen to Singapore’s children and grandchildren if there is “no more land” to recycle for future public housing.  “How will they have access to subsidised housing in the future?” he asked. “The Government must grapple with these questions, study the matter, and do the responsible thing,” he said.  The issue of lease extension is also not so straightforward a matter, and it must not be assumed that everyone wants it, the minister said. There is also the issue of maintenance. “Much more maintenance is needed for older flats and this will be costly for residents,\" said Mr Wong.  He added that the Government made it clear from the HDB lease is 99 years, which is “a long time” covering two generations.  “Our duty is not just to the current generation who already own homes, but also to the future generations – those not yet voting, and those not yet born, whose lives and future depend on us making the right decisions on their behalf,” he said.  There is still time to work through the issues, he added. MISINFORMATION CAN IMPACT MARKET But for now, what’s important is that people do not speculate or spread misinformation which can impact on the market, Mr Wong said.  One such example of misinformation was that the Government would stop the use of CPF entirely for the purchase of HDB flats. Addressing this in his speech, Mr Wong said the Government has no such plans. Even for older flats, CPF can still be used but under certain conditions to safeguard homebuyers’ retirement adequacy, he said. The speculation started from a media report highlighting a suggestion from an academic, who later clarified that his views were not fully reflected. Still, the information continued to circulate online and through chat groups, Mr Wong said. “What’s important is that we do not speculate or spread misinformation which can impact on the market,” he said. DOING MORE TO MAKE RESALE MARKET WORK BETTER Apart from the HDB resale portal, which was launched at the beginning of this year to make transactions faster, Mr Wong said more will be done to make the resale market work better. The Government will provide more information on the available flats in the market, whether new or resale, to help buyers and sellers transact more smoothly and help Singaporeans make more informed housing decisions that best suit their needs. “We will continue to monitor market trends closely and make use of various policy levers to ensure a stable and sustainable property market,” he said, giving assurance that the Government will continue to provide affordable and quality homes for all Singaporeans, both now and in the future.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/there-is-still-value-in-older-hdb-flats-minister-for-national-10243064"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 05:44PM", "tags": ["Mahathir Mohamad", "Malaysia", "Lee Hsien Loong", "KL-Singapore high-speed rail", "1MDB"], "author": "Sumisha Naidu", "title": "No agenda set yet for Saturday's meeting between PM Mahathir and PM Lee", "content": " KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's new prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, could not confirm if the KL-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project would be on the agenda when he meets Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday (May 19).

Responding to the President’s address, he said that Singapore’s economy must grow so that its people can have good jobs and the opportunities to change the world.  “We must grow so that we have the resources to build our home, to take care of one another, and to protect ourselves. We must grow for our children, to give them a better future,” he said.  Elaborating on being pro-business, Mr Chee said that the Government will pro-actively seek feedback from businesses, cut red tape, and provide a safe space for experimentation. The 4G leadership will pro-actively seek feedback from businesses to “make it part of our DNA and our instincts to be pro-enterprise”, to continuously improve rules and licensing framework and to speed up processes and facilitate new business ideas.  He gave an example of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority and the Singapore Civil Defence Force working with the Singapore Manufacturing Federation to enhance regulations for cold stores, eventually saving companies several thousands of dollars per year. CUTTING RED TAPE IN THE FOOD SECTOR “We will cut red tape and simplify our licensing regime to reduce compliance costs for businesses,” he added. He said a deep dive is being done into the regulatory requirements for the food sector. “Currently, companies can have up to 14 touch-points with different government agencies before they can set up a food shop. We asked ourselves, is it really necessary to have 14 touch-points? This is Singapore, we can do better,” he said.  The Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) is working with Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and GovTech on this review, he said, adding that an “ambitious target” has been set to streamline the 14 forms into one form, and to correspondingly reduce the time taken and licence fees which companies have to pay to start a food business.  “I don’t know if our pilot will succeed, but we will try,” he said.  He added that while the food industry is not the biggest sector in our economy, the Government started with it because the regulatory improvements can benefit many SMEs and workers. The Government will also encourage experimentation via mechanisms such as regulatory sandboxes, which encourage stakeholders to experiment within a well-defined “safe” space.  “But we have to try, as remaining status quo and playing it safe is simply not tenable when we have to compete with other cities in the world for ideas, investments and talent. In such an environment, the most dangerous strategy is to make no bold moves,” he said.  PRO-BUSINESS RULES CAN HAVE LASTING IMPACT ON SOCIETAL CULTURE Being pro-business not only impacts the economy, but also social norms and compact, Mr Chee said. “It is about supporting risk-taking and overcoming our fear of failure. In the process of trying something new, we learn and become more resilient and more resourceful,” he said. Such changes can have a “significant and lasting impact on our societal culture and the kind of society we want Singapore to be”, he said, bringing up the example of three Singaporean undergraduates who were told to stop brewing and selling beer on their university hostel premises. The three men,  Mr Rahul Immandira, Mr Heetesh Alwani and Mr Abilash Subbaraman, had experimented with brewing their own brand of beer- Binjai Brew, and sold it to their friends, but were told to stop as they were breaking laws.  Mr Chee, who said he had tried the beer and that it was “very good”, said he and the PEP secretariat have offered their help to the men.  “We met the 3 young men over dinner and had a good discussion on how our current licensing regime could be reviewed to lower the barriers of entry for micro-brewers to test out new products during an initial trial period,” he said. This would be before applying a more rigorous set of rules when they subsequently scale up their production and sales. The Ministry is looking into the suggestion and will discuss with the regulatory agencies, he said, acknowledging that while it is not guaranteed success, “we will give it a shot”. BELIEVING IN SINGAPOREAN COMPANIES AND TALENT TO GROW ECONOMY Mr Chee also spoke about the importance of believing in Singaporeans and local enterprises.  “The Government will give fair consideration to Singapore companies when we procure products and services to seek out creative and innovative ideas from our companies, to partner them in our government projects and to enable them to build a track record to compete overseas,” he said.  He pointed to the Health Promotion Board appointing Activate Interactive, a local SME, to develop the Healthy 365 mobile app and provide the steps trackers for the first season of National Steps Challenge. The company is now able to hold a place in the wearables market among well entrenched competitors and it is developing new innovative products and expanding into overseas markets, he said.  Still, to be pro Singapore-worker is not just about having safeguards, and “certainly not about building walls and closing our doors to new immigrants and global talent”, Mr Chee cautioned. “With Singapore’s ageing population, such an approach will only hurt the country and our people. To be pro Singapore-worker, I believe the more effective way is to grow our economy and help our companies to do well, so that they can provide better jobs, better pay and better life for our workers,” he said.  To maximize the potential of our people, Singapore’s economy must have the capacity to generate good jobs and provide our people access to the best opportunities, the best networks and the best ideas.  “We cannot rely on MNCs alone to achieve this, but neither should we look inward and only focus on local SMEs,” he said.  With the international business landscape becoming more xenophobic and less welcoming to trade and foreign investments, Singapore must resist these forces of populism and protectionism, he said.  He said: “Let us have the courage to once again take a contrarian position by keeping Singapore open and connected with the world, and to boldly experiment with innovative ideas and transform our economy.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/parliament/sms-chee-hong-tat-highlights-three-strategies-to-grow-singapore-10242550"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 05:03PM", "tags": ["MAS", "finance"], "author": "", "title": "MAS issues prohibition orders against former Prudential, AIA, Citibank representatives", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Thursday (May 17) that it has issued prohibition orders against six people for the mis-selling of investment products. The individuals were former representatives of Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Prudential), AIA Singapore (AIA) and Citibank Singapore, MAS said in a media release. Their misconduct includes forgery, making false or misleading statements to clients, improper switching of policies and providing financial advice without due consideration of a client's financial situation. A total of 29 clients were affected, including two vulnerable clients.  The prohibition orders prevent them from providing financial advisory service, as well as from taking part in the management, acting as a director or becoming a substantial shareholder of any financial advisory firm, for between two and seven years, MAS said. One of the individuals is also prohibited from performing any regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Act, and from taking part in the management, acting as a director, or becoming a substantial shareholder of any capital market services firm, for a period of two years.  In the first of these cases, David Hiah Xinkai, who was working for Prudential at the time, was issued a seven-year prohibition order for forgery and providing false or misleading information to the insurer. Hiah had forged the signatures of several policyholders to \"effect fund switches in their investment-linked policies\" without their knowledge or consent, said MAS. \"Mr Hiah did so as he was concerned that the policyholders would surrender their policies and that he would face disciplinary action by Prudential if the surrenders took place,\" added the authority. In addition, he intentionally provided false or misleading information relating to his clients' personal details to Prudential when arranging insurance contracts for his clients. This resulted in his clients losing their policy rights while Hiah earned commissions from the sale of the insurance contracts, said MAS. Hiah's prohibition order took effect from May 14. Meanwhile, former representative of AIA Heng Goid Hoon was issued a four-year prohibition order after advising a client to switch investment-linked policies without disclosing the switching costs to the client. Heng also made \"false declarations\" on the client's policy application forms to avoid scrutiny from AIA, said MAS. As a result, her client incurred \"significant switching costs ... without any real benefit from the switch\", said the authority. \"Ms Heng was also able to secure commissions from the switching by deliberately delaying the policy switch to circumvent industry prescribed rules that disallow commissions for early policy replacement,\" said MAS. Heng's prohibition order took effect from Apr 30. The misconduct committed by Hiah and Heng involved vulnerable clients, leading to stiffer action against the pair, said MAS. 4 OTHERS ALSO ISSUED PROHIBITION ORDERS Apart from Heng, two other former representatives of AIA were also issued prohibition orders.  Koh Mei Ling and Jane Yeo Hui Rong were both issued three-year prohibition orders, both of which took effect from Apr 30. Koh was issued a prohibition order after recommending an investment-linked policy to her client without \"due consideration\" of her client's financial situation, said MAS. She also provided false information to AIA by \"intentionally inflating her client's annual income\" in the policy application. \"As a result, Ms Koh earned commissions from the sale of the investment-linked policy and the client purchased an investment-linked policy she could not afford,\" said MAS. Meanwhile, Yeo made \"false and misleading statements\" to her clients about the features of their investment-linked policies, misrepresenting that their policies had guaranteed investment returns, when she knew this was not the case. \"Ms Yeo secured commissions from the sale of these policies and the clients did not earn the promised returns,\" said MAS. In addition, Nigel Chua Bingquan (who was working for Prudential at the time) and Zheng Xuemei (who was working for Citibank Singapore) were both also issued prohibition orders by MAS for misconduct including making false or misleading statements to their clients, as well as making false declarations in the sales documents in order to avoid scrutiny from their respective companies. Chua was issued a three-year prohibition order while Zheng was issued a two-year prohibition order. Both orders took effect from May 14. AFFECTED AIA CUSTOMERS \"REMEDIATED\" FOR LOSSES AIA Singapore said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia that the customers affected by the misconduct of its three former representatives \"have been remediated for any losses\" they may have suffered. \"We strictly adhere to a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent acts by any of our representatives,\" it said. \"In the event that our customers’ interests are compromised as a result of misconduct by any of our representatives, AIA Singapore would ensure that appropriate actions are taken to remediate the affected customers,\" it added. A Citi spokesperson also said that the bank does not tolerate such misconduct. \"The individual was dismissed in 2016. We do not tolerate any misconduct that goes against the laws of the country and/or the policies of the bank,” it said. Mr Lee Boon Ngiap, assistant managing director for capital markets at MAS, stressed that financial institution representatives have a duty of care to their customers. \"Representatives of financial institutions who give advice on financial products have a duty of care to their customers,\" he said. \"MAS will take stern action against representatives who betray the trust placed in them and provide false or misleading information or give irresponsible advice to their customers.”  Additional reporting by Junn Loh.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mas-prohibition-order-misconduct-investment-10242812"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 04:21PM", "tags": ["youth", "millennials"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Singapore youths no longer drawn to 5Cs; they have YOLO mindset: Maliki", "content": " SINGAPORE: The younger generation in Singapore are developing their own definition of success, and the Government will need to co-create the right social compact for their time, Dr Maliki Osman said in Parliament on Thursday (May 17).  Dr Maliki, who was speaking on the fourth day of debates on the President’s Address, touched on the importance of understanding the concerns and aspirations of millennials as they will inherit and actively shape Singapore’s future.  President Halimah Yacob said in her speech last week that Singapore’s fourth generation leadership will \"work in concert\" with young Singaporeans, and must \"fire up\" and mobillise their spirit and energy.   In highlighting the mindset of youths today, Dr Maliki said that the Singaporean dream of possessing the 5Cs – cash, car, credit card, condominium and a country card membership - was “in the past” and that millennials are developing their own definition of success. “Our youths today crave memorable and purposeful experiences that emphasise the importance of the journey, instead of being fixated with the destination,” explained Dr Maliki, who is senior minister of state for defence and foreign affairs.   He added that the youths want to be excited about where they live, work and play, encapsulated by the You Only Live Once (YOLO) attitude. “To this end, our youths can look forward to raising families in homes that will boast both physical and digital connectivity. Just imagine, by leveraging artificial intelligence, smart homes could render current day household chores an afterthought,” Dr Maliki said. Meanwhile at work, he added that millennials will come to grips with the challenges of participating in the extremely competitive global labour marketplace. “More will job hop, with high attrition rates in some professions – because just earning money is not enough – young people want to know that they have made a difference. They look for new experiences and learn new things as they know the possession of single or static skillsets is not sufficient to thrive amid the competition,” he said.  Dr Maliki added that millennials also enjoy hunting down “Instagram-worthy hangouts” and participating in various arts or sporting events, and so Singapore must be able to cater to such leisure activities. “To satisfy this new generation’s thirst for novel experiences, this government will need to partner our citizens to redefine the meaning of success, and recognise that paradoxically, it might be one that continually shifts and always gives us something new and better to aspire towards,” he said. Recognising that e-commerce has changed the retail experience, making it possible for millennials to now make purchases from the comfort of home at just the click of a button, Dr Maliki stressed that the Singapore Public Service must reimagine the way it delivers its services.  \"This issues a clarion call to the government to raise our standards of public service delivery to satisfy the expectations of our people. This is our opportunity to reimagine many areas of governance such as housing, health, social services, education and transportation,\" he added.  FOMO CO-CREATING SINGAPORE’S FUTURE Referring to the concept of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) - a prevalent mindset of apprehension among youths that they will miss out on something great - Dr Maliki stressed that there is “huge potential” for young Singaporeans to participate in co-creation and take ownership of Singapore.

I am usually quite careful about saying these things, but I think so too; there should be criminal charges,\" Mr Shanmugam said.   Corporal (CPL) Kok Yuen Chin died on May 13 after being found unconscious at the bottom of a 12m-deep fire station pump well that was filled with water. He had gone into the pump well at Tuas View fire station as part of activities to celebrate his impending ORD with squad mates. Two SCDF regulars - a Staff Seargeant and a First Warrant Officer - were arrested on Monday.  The body of CPL Kok was cremated on Thursday at his hometown in Melaka. The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday also mentioned that criminal proceedings may be launched against those found responsible for CPL Kok's drowning.  Mr Shanmugam said there is a \"fair bit of evidence\" as to what had happened that night, in terms of witnesses and objective evidence, but it was inappropriate for him to go into the details at this stage. He added that the Board of Inquiry, with the majority of its members from outside the Government, will look into the facts of the incident. MHA had said the BOI will be chaired by a senior director from the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and will include members who are not from MHA or SCDF.  \"What I can say is that the conduct was unacceptable; it was a clear and serious violation of the rules,\" Mr Shanmugam said.  He added: \"People play games, they horse around, they make people like CPL Kok do dangerous things, even force them into dangerous situations. And people who do this don't think, they don't think about how it can go wrong.  \"When it does go wrong, a life is lost.

This message was conveyed to SCDF officers on Wednesday by Commissioner Eric Yap, who said commanders are entrusted with the responsibility to look after the men and women who risk their lives every day, and it is their duty to make sure they are not harmed or demeaned by others.  \"There will be zero tolerance,\" said Mr Shanmugam in Parliament. \"We have to do, and we will do our best, to not let this happen again.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/scdf-nsf-death-there-will-almost-certainly-be-criminal-10242770"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 04:06PM", "tags": ["SMRT", "public transport"], "author": "", "title": "5 stations along NSL to have shorter operating hours in June", "content": " SINGAPORE: Five stations along the North-South Line (NSL) will have their operating hours adjusted on Fridays and weekends for more rail maintenance works to take place, announced SMRT on Thursday (May 17).  Admiralty, Sembawang, Yishun, Khatib and Yio Chu Kang MRT stations will close earlier at around 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays and open later at around 8am on the weekends from Jun 1 to Jul 1.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Commuters will still be able to travel on the NSL during this period between Jurong East and Woodlands, and between Ang Mo Kio and Marina South Pier.  Train services will retain normal operating hours on Jun 15 to Jun 17, with operating hours extended on the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, said SMRT.  ALTERNATIVE TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS During this period, shuttle bus service 10 will ferry passengers along the stretch of NSL between Woodlands and Ang Mo Kio stations, said the transport operator.  The shuttle will stop at designated bus stops near the affected stations to pick up and drop off passengers.  Express 17, another shuttle, will operate point-to-point between Woodlands and Bukit Panjang stations, connecting commuters directly to the Downtown Line, added SMRT.  \n\n\n\n\n \"As the timing of the first and last trains departing the affected stationsalong the NSL will vary, commuters are advised to check for station-specifictimings on SMRT’s trains’ website and social media platforms when planningtheir journeys on affected dates,\" SMRT added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-nsl-late-opening-five-stations-10242890"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 02:17PM", "tags": ["Ong Ye Kung", "crime"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Former grassroots volunteer jailed 8 years for using Ong Ye Kung’s name to cheat victims", "content": " SINGAPORE: A former grassroots volunteer was jailed eight years on Thursday (May 17) for committing various cheating, forgery and money laundering offences involving more than S$1.4 million. Reichie Chng Teck Kiam, 51, also created fake WhatsApp conversations using the name of Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, to make his victims believe that the scheme they were investing in – a legal moneylending business promising monthly returns of 3 to 8 per cent – was legitimate. Chng pleaded guilty to 30 charges for offences including cheating, committing forgery to cheat others, money laundering and obtaining a personal loan while he was an undischarged bankrupt.  He was slapped with more than 150 charges last year. The remaining charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.  He claimed that the money he obtained was used largely to fund his gambling habit. CHNG FORGED WHATSAPP CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR ONG The court heard that over a period of about four years and four months, Chng cheated 12 victims. He was a grassroots volunteer at the Kaki Bukit constituency from 2010 to 2015, and got to know Mr Ong, who was the constituency’s adviser before he was elected to Parliament in 2015. Chng had informed the victims that he was raising funds for investment in Elite Investment & Credit (EIC), a Singapore-registered company that ran a legal moneylending business. However, he was not involved in any way with the business or its operations. On one occasion, Chng also requested a personal loan of S$250,000 from another victim, claiming that he needed the money to repay two bank loans on the same day. In order to bolster the legitimacy of his investment scheme, Chng also claimed that Mr Ong and his wife were involved, and decided to create fake WhatsApp conversations that had supposedly taken place between Mr Ong and himself. Chng created an additional WhatsApp account using a second mobile phone line, set a photo of Mr Ong as the account’s profile photo, and used “OYK” as the profile’s name. Using this account, he created WhatsApp conversations related to the EIC investment scheme. He would then take screenshots of the WhatsApp conversations and send them to the victims. He also forged a total of 19 business loan agreements, each bearing the letterhead “Elite Investment & Credit”, to convince one victim of the legitimacy of the scheme. Chng also forged a business agreement that he had purportedly entered into with a person by the name of “Diana Kuik Sin Len”. The agreement said that Mr Ong was the spouse of this person, and that Chng had invested a sum of S$15 million with her. He then showed this agreement to one of the victims. Mr Ong’s wife’s name is in fact Diana Kuik Sin Leng. Chng's scheme was discovered when Mr Ong was informed by one of the victims about the WhatsApp conversations and the agreement that was supposedly with his wife. Mr Ong promptly made a police report in March 2017. The court heard that only S$51,680 of the S$1.4 million has been repaid by Chng to date. In sentencing, District Judge Ng Peng Hong noted that Chng had “exploited his position as a grassroots (volunteer)”, and added that the jail term reflects Chng’s level of culpability.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/reichie-chng-ong-ye-kung-grassroots-volunteer-jailed-10242482"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 02:06PM", "tags": ["national service", "SAF", "MINDEF", "SCDF"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "NS training deaths: New measures to improve investigations, says Ng Eng Hen", "content": " SINGAPORE: Several measures have been introduced to strengthen the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) investigation processes, following the recent deaths of full-time National Servicemen (NSF) Gavin Chan, Dave Lee and Kok Yuen Chin, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in a ministerial statement on Thursday (May 17).  Dr Ng said in Parliament that any death among SAF soldiers or Home Team personnel is “grievous”, as they serve the nation with loyalty, commitment and pride to defend the island – “often in challenging and dangerous circumstances knowing the risks to themselves”. “Especially painful is when young NSFs die – all of us feel it acutely,” he said. “This House offers our deepest condolences to the families of 3SG Gavin Chan, CFC Dave Lee and SCDF CPL Kok Yuen Chin. We know that mere words cannot replace their loss.” The minister’s statement was in response to parliamentary questions by MPs Henry Kwek and Vikram Nair, Non-constituency MP Dennis Tan and Nominated MP Ganesh Rajaram. The minister also reiterated the Ministry of Defence’s (MINDEF) commitment to make sure training deaths within the SAF can be eliminated through designing safety systems and enforcing them. It’s a “difficult goal”, he acknowledged, but one they must reach because if not, another “precious son (is) lost to a family”. IMPROVING TRAINING SAFETY In terms of training safety measures, Dr Ng said following CFC Lee’s death, SAF is currently evaluating the use of individual wearable devices to monitor a soldier’s condition in real time.  MINDEF will also commission an External Medical Panel, as it did in 2010, to review the armed forces’ policies and measures for the management of heat injuries, particularly as recorded temperatures here have gone up over the last two decades, he added. Following these deaths, independent and impartial investigative processes will be taken to determine the key facts, arrive at appropriate conclusions, take corrective measures to ensure that mistakes are not repeated, Dr Ng said. “This includes punishing those who contributed to the death through reckless and negligent acts,” he said. Evidence of these processes can be seen in the aftermath of CPL Chan’s death, as well as with CFC Lee’s given that the Committee of Inquiry (COI) and police investigations are ongoing, the minister pointed out. The minister also took the opportunity to acknowledge the accusations levelled at the commanders of CFC Lee. “But we should let the independent COI and police fully investigate the circumstances to establish the facts. We will deal with any wrongdoing thoroughly.  \"Those who deserve to be punished, will be punished,” he said.  EXTERNAL PARTY TO BE PART OF COI To add another layer to the process, Dr Ng said MINDEF has discussed with the External Review Panel on SAF Safety (ERPSS) to have one of its members to be part of the COIs for training-related deaths. The ERPSS consists of safety experts and professionals outside the SAF and helps MINDEF “scrutinise” the armed forces’ safety management system. It reports periodically to the Defence Minister on the rigour of the system and presents recommendations to improve. Additionally, the COI will submit its full report to the ERPSS for “further questions, comments and views”, and the panel will provide a written public report on the COI findings, the minister said. “With these multiple layers of safety and with experts within and outside assisting the SAF, we can move decisively to make zero training deaths the norm,” Dr Ng said. He noted that over the last two decades, there has been one NS training-related death each year on average and, while admitting it is “difficult”, eliminating training deaths “must be done”. “Chief of Defence Force and service chiefs have assured me that safety has always been, and will continue to, get their highest command attention to achieve zero fatalities,” Dr Ng said. “But we need every level to play their part, down to the individual commander and soldier to protect their own wellbeing and that of their men and their buddies.”  MPs further asked Dr Ng about various aspects of NS training following his statement, with 13 of them asking follow-up questions. NCMP Tan, who had filed a parliamentary question on the Shoalwater Bay incident as well as posed supplementary questions after, said he did so last Monday \"as it has been more than half a year since the accident and no information has been shed on how the accident took place and what lessons have been learnt or changes that will be made for SAF training protocols\" as a result.  The Defence Minister had in his ministerial statement also shed more light into 3SG Chan's training death last September, including making public the Queensland coroner's report which was signed off on Mar 6 this year.  \"The minister has answered my questions,\" Mr Tan told Channel NewsAsia in an email.  Mr Kwek, who also filed a question that Dr Ng responded to in his ministerial statement, said he did so earlier because it is \"important to establish the facts for serious training incidents, including this one\".  The PAP backbencher, who is also part of the government parliamentary committees for defence and foreign affairs, said his will withdraw his parliamentary question following the Defence Minister's statement and \"robust\" accompanying debate. Others who posed supplementary questions include MP Lee Bee Wah, who asked if the \"tekan culture\" continues to exist in NS after a resident shared concerns, while Mr Murali Pillai asked about possibly opening up COIs and BOIs to family members looking for answers. Mr Ang Hin Kee, who said he has a family member in the same platoon as CFC Lee, wondered if MINDEF had spoken to the platoon mates and their families to allay their concerns over training. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ns-training-deaths-ng-eng-hen-new-measures-improve-investigation-10242472"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 01:55PM", "tags": ["Gavin Chan", "national service", "SAF"], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Training death of 3SG Gavin Chan: No negligence or misconduct, but SAF training rules reviewed", "content": " SINGAPORE: More details have come to light about the death of 3rd Sergeant (3SG) Gavin Chan last September during training in Australia. The details were revealed by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in his ministerial statement on Thursday (May 17) regarding National Service (NS) training deaths. Speaking in Parliament, Dr Ng said all investigative processes, including those by the Queensland authorities, given the incident occurred in Australia’s Shoalwater Bay, have been completed and the coroner’s report provided to the dead NSF’s parents.  3SG Chan had served one year and eight months of his NS liabilities when the incident happened, in which he had suffered multiple injuries sustained as a result of motor vehicle trauma. The parents have also given permission for the report to be shared in Parliament, except for the post-mortem findings which were redacted, the minister said. “VERY UNFORTUNATE” INCIDENT According to the findings, the Queensland police investigations found that there were no defects with the Bionix armoured infantry vehicle. Based on scene evidence and witness information they gathered, the Bionix’s path forward was halted due to an obstruction and 3SG Chan, who was the vehicle commander, gave orders for the driver to reverse slowly down the hill. At that point, he was stationed in the turret with his upper body “clear of the vehicle structure” giving instructions to the driver on where to reverse. “All confirmed that the driver was continuing to reverse slowly, and in accordance with the commander’s instructions, when the vehicle traversed over a flat granite rock for about four metres before the vehicle became stuck on a large boulder, holding upon the vehicle undercarriage,” the coroner’s finding said. It added that the commander instructed the driver to turn the steering wheel to try and gain traction when “suddenly the vehicle dropped down over the rock rolling sideways before coming to rest further down the slope”. 3SG Chan was “ejected from the vehicle and suffered significant injuries”, after which life support was rendered before he was airlifted to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead, the findings showed. “The police considered that it was likely that the incident occurred because of the commander’s decision to reverse on a slightly different path down the hill and that his choice to be positioned with part of his body outside the vehicle exposed him to greater risk of injury,” the coroner’s findings said. The Queensland police also considered the incident to be a “very unfortunate” one while deployed in difficult terrain in “black out” conditions. The report was signed off on Mar 6 this year, according to documents seen by Channel NewsAsia. Dr Ng said in his statement that the independent Committee of Inquiry (COI), which was convened by the Armed Forces Council, corroborated the police findings. The statement was in response to questions posed by MPs Henry Kwek and Vikram Nair, Non-constituency MP Dennis Tan and Nominated MP Ganesh Rajaram on recent NS deaths within the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). He said the committee found that the mishap occurred during night training for Bionix units, which was conducted regularly to train armour units to fight at night and under conditions of poor visibility. 3SG Chan and his platoon mates were “sufficiently trained and qualified to participate in the exercise, and had no mental and physical conditions that could have affected their fitness to participate”, Dr Ng added. The medical and safety coverage provided were also found by the committee to be “timely, adequate and proper”, the minister said. SAFETY LAPSES IDENTIFIED There were some safety lapses identified by the COI though, Dr Ng pointed out. For one, the night vision device (NVD) on 3SG Chan’s vehicle was not working. 3SG Chan decided to continue driving without headlights, even though night driving should be done with the driver's hatch open and headlights switched on. According to the driver, 3SG Chan said “it would give away their position to the enemy”, the minister added. In the darkness, the vehicle entered an area with steep inclines and boulders and, after dismounting, 3SG Chan found that a boulder was blocking the vehicle. He got on the Bionix and, sitting on the top edge of the vehicle commander hatch, told the driver to reverse the vehicle with the hatch open and headlights switched on. But the vehicle overturned on the steep embankment as they did so, he said.  The three other soldiers within the Bionix did not suffer any injuries from the mishap, he said. The COI did not find any “negligence, foul play or misconduct”, the Defence Minister said, but it did recommend the SAF review its training safety regulations on the position of the vehicle commander for armoured fighting vehicles. So, if the commander is unable to execute the overturning drill, the vehicle must stop and be stationary. It also recommended strong checks with regard to the NVDs and to enforce the wearing of seatbelts for passengers when the vehicle is moving. Dr Ng said SAF has since implemented additional training for vehicle commanders over uneven terrain, with training rules limiting exposure of their bodies to waist level when executing certain operational tasks. It also now has a drill that includes checking if the NVD, and other night fighting equipment, works when transiting to night exercise, as well as taking up the seatbelt recommendation, with the minister saying disciplinary actions will be taken against those found in breach of safety. He said 3SG Chan’s death was classified as training related and compensation has been offered to the family. His parents had also accepted the honours of a military funeral. Around a hundred family members, friends and NS colleagues had paid their final respects at 3SG Chan’s wake in Pasir Ris last September.  “The armour formation paid their last respects to a dedicated commander who they are proud to call one of their own,” Dr Ng said. \"Sergeant Gavin Chan is a good soldier.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saf-training-death-gavin-chan-no-negligence-or-misconduct-10242480"}, {"datetime": "17 May 2018 12:48PM", "tags": ["SCDF", "Kok Yuen Chin"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "SCDF NSF death: CPL Kok Yuen Chin’s body cremated in hometown of Melaka", "content": " KRUBONG, Melaka: The body of the late Singapore Civil Defence Force full-time national serviceman who died on his last day of service was cremated on Thursday (May 17).

The project will see between four to eight giant artificial reef structures being pre-fabricated off-site and sunk in the waters off Small Sister's Island, within the Sisters' Islands Marine Park. The number of structures will depend on the final design. Each reef structure will be made from materials including concrete, steel and rocks recycled from other JTC projects. Standing at 10m, the equivalent of a three-storey terrace house, the structures will occupy the entire water column from sub-surface to the seafloor, sitting on the seabed. To avoid disturbing the underwater environment, no piling or major works will be carried out, said NParks and JTC. Mostly bare with a sandy substrate, the area where the structures will be placed was chosen in consultation with relevant government agencies, experts, as well as members of the Friends of the Marine Park Community. Expected to contribute some 500 sq m of additional reef area to the Marine Park, the project will also help to support existing habitat enhancement and reef restoration efforts to conserve marine biodiversity. Finding solutions to conserve marine reefs is important, given rising temperatures which will lead to more coral bleaching. \"If we can find strategies now, we can hedge against future climate change challenges,\" said Dr Karenne Tun, director of the coastal and marine branch at NParks' National Biodiversity Centre.

Mr Kok Meng Hua, 56, was speaking to Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday, at his son’s wake in the quiet Melaka suburb of Krubong. Mr Kok works six days a week doing construction in Singapore, with Sunday being his only day off. “What are you doing today? Are you working?” Mr Kok recalled asking his son after knocking off early that day. As a firefighter at Tuas View Fire Station, Yuen Chin worked one 24-hour shift followed by two days off. That day was his day off, he replied. “Want to have dinner together?” Mr Kok continued, suggesting their usual hawker centre in Bukit Panjang, where Mr Kok lives. Yuen Chin hesitated. He had a buffet date with his girlfriend. By then he had moved out of his dad’s place to live independently with her in a rented room in Jurong. It was nearer to his Tuas workplace. Yuen Chin invited his dad along for the buffet, but Mr Kok declined. He’d had a rough day at work, so he wanted a proper meal with rice. Another day then, Mr Kok remembered he said. Yuen Chin was just a month away from his Operationally Ready Date (ORD) and Mr Kok thought there would be more opportunities to have a dinner with him and discuss the next chapter of his son’s life. But the next chapter never came. And so that was the last time Mr Kok heard from his son. On Sunday night, Yuen Chin was found unconscious at the bottom of a 12m pump well at his fire station. Eleven metres of the well had been filled with water. Yuen Chin was rushed to a hospital, but was pronounced dead. When Mr Kok visited the well to pray and leave offerings, he was shocked by its narrow diameter and sheer depth. \"How could he have a chance to survive?\" Mr Kok said. Mr Kok’s younger sister Helen, 55, said the family wants answers. Did anyone jump in the moment they realised Yuen Chin was not coming up?  While investigations into how exactly Yuen Chin ended up in the well are still ongoing, SCDF has said that it was part of activities to celebrate his impending ORD.  For closure, Ms Kok said the family wants to watch CCTV footage of the incident, but she added that it’s unclear if they will be able to. “I just want to know how they tried to save my son,” Mr Kok said. INDEPENDENT, HELPFUL BOY Whenever Yuen Chin returned home to Melaka, which was about twice a month, he never hesitated to help around the house. “After dinner he automatically washes the plates, wipes the table and sweeps the floor,\" Ms Kok said. Yuen Chin would take S$600 out of his salary to give to his mother, who lives in Melaka. Then he would take his siblings out to the mall, treating them to movies and ice cream. The last time he went home was on Malaysia’s polling day on May 9. He didn’t vote, but wanted to accompany his girlfriend who was going to. Mr Kok didn't go back because he couldn't take time off work. It was then that Yuen Chin told family members he wanted to work as an auxiliary police officer. Mr Kok had asked Yuen Chin if he wanted to sign on as a firefighter. He entertained the idea, but said he didn’t have the necessary academic qualifications. When Mr Kok asked Yuen Chin to approach his superiors for a recommendation, he said he didn’t want to trouble them. This self-reliant attitude is also what made him so endearing, Ms Kok said. “When he had difficulty with his studies, he never told his parents,” she added. \"He loved his mother very much,\" Mr Kok said. THE OTHER CALL It was about 9.50pm on Sunday when Mr Kok, in an express bus on his way back to Singapore, was first told of the incident. Every week on Saturday night after work, Mr Kok goes back to Melaka to see his wife. He rides his motorcycle across the border, parks it at Larkin in Johor and takes a bus home. On Sunday night, he does the same, but in the other direction. “Can you come to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital now?” he was told. “What happened?” he probed. The other person on the line would only say that his son had fainted in a pool. His heart raced. Mr Kok knew his son hated the water and couldn't swim. And it would still be hours before he reached Johor, let alone Singapore. Mr Kok called his sister and asked her to go to the hospital. “I asked her to call me when my son regained consciousness,” he said. He only reached Johor at midnight. There was still no call. He rode his motorcycle with one fist clenched around his phone. “If it rang, I would quickly pull over and answer,” he said. The call never came. “That was when I knew my son was no more.” Mr Kok parked his bike at home and took a taxi to the hospital because he didn’t know where to park. He called his sister. “How is my son now?” he pressed. Ms Kok wouldn’t answer. “Twice I asked and her voice changed,” he said. “I only knew it wasn’t good.” When the taxi pulled in, Mr Kok said at least three SCDF officers were waiting. They led him into a room, where a doctor told him “we did our best but could not save your son\". Yuen Chin was in a neck brace and had some cuts on his face, Mr Kok said. “Your papa is here now,” he could only say. HIS JOURNEY Like a lot of kids, Yuen Chin grew up playing football with his neighbours on a field just in front of his house. He would also be glued to his phone playing games, Mr Kok said with a smile. After finishing the equivalent of his polytechnic diploma in Malaysia, Yuen Chin decided to pursue citizenship so he could work in Singapore. Mr Kok had offered to pay for him to further his studies, but he refused. When he got enlisted into the SCDF, Mr Kok joked that it would be easier than serving in the army. “Even if it’s tough, I’ll still do it,” Yuen Chin said. “I just want to finish the two years.” Yuen Chin graduated from the Civil Defence Academy as a firefighter and lived with his dad for about a year. During the time they bunked together, they talked about work. Because the fire station was so remote, Yuen Chin would round up orders from his colleagues and buy back food for them, a job that he said newbies had to do. And because the fire station was so remote, Yuen Chin didn’t have that many cases to attend. “Where did you go today? Wash oil off the roads?” Mr Kok would joke. Yuen Chin would insist that he still fought fires, at factories in places like Yew Tee. Mr Kok felt good about Yuen Chin eking out a future in Singapore. “I have always thought of Singapore as a safe place,” he said. “It’s not like overseas, where there might be a lot of trouble.” When Yuen Chin moved out to live with his girlfriend, Mr Kok gave him more freedom. “I didn’t want to call every day; he was earning an income,” he said. “He had already grown up.” He said that Yuen Chin and his girlfriend would often come over for dinner.  “I was just happy that he had finished his two years,” he added. “I also thought of asking about his plans after ORD: Are you finding work? Are you coming back to the kampung for a week? “I just didn’t have the chance to ask.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/scdf-nsf-death-corporal-kok-yuen-chin-s-last-conversation-with-10240010"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 08:03PM", "tags": ["SCDF", "Kok Yuen Chin"], "author": "", "title": "Death of SCDF NSF: AGC reviewing case with a view to start criminal proceedings", "content": " SINGAPORE: Criminal proceedings may be launched against those found responsible for the drowning of a full-time national serviceman (NSF) from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).  \"The State Coroner may call for an inquiry into the death.

UNIT COMMANDERS WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED ACTIVITIES In a message to SCDF officers on Wednesday, Commissioner Eric Yap made clear that unit commanders will be held accountable and responsible for any unauthorised initiation or ragging activities by anyone under their charge. The NSF who died, Corporal (CPL) Kok Yuen Chin, drowned on Sunday after he went into a 12m-deep pump well as part of activities to celebrate his impending Operationally Ready Date. “I had personally briefed all commanders yesterday and underlined the importance of command responsibility,” said Commissioner Yap. “Commanders are entrusted with the responsibility to look after the men and women who risk their lives every day. It is our duty to ensure they are not harmed or demeaned by the actions of others,” he added. “There must be zero tolerance for any officer who contravenes the rules, and we must take all necessary measures to eradicate such activities.” Commissioner Yap warned that those who are aware of such ragging activities being carried out, yet do nothing to stop or report them, also bear responsibility. He said: “Each day, we put our lives at risk to protect and save lives and property. We pride ourselves on being the Life Saving Force. But amongst us, there may be some who flout the rules, or turn a blind eye to unauthorised initiation or ragging activities being carried out by officers who clearly do not embrace our core values.” Describing the death of CPL Kok as a “heartbreaking loss”, the commissioner said Wednesday marked the day he would have completed his two-year full-time national service with the SCDF. He added that incident has damaged the credibility of the force. “We must do our utmost to regain the trust of the public, the families who entrust their sons to us to serve their National Service, and our own men and women too,” said Commissioner Yap.  “Even as we mourn the loss of one of our own, we owe it to CPL Kok to ensure that this must never happen again.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/scdf-nsf-death-agc-reviewing-case-criminal-proceedings-10240224"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 07:40PM", "tags": ["property", "Holland Village"], "author": "", "title": "Stirling Land gets Holland Road tender with S$1.21b bid", "content": " SINGAPORE: Stirling Land Holdings has been awarded the tender for a 99-year leasehold land parcel at Holland Road and its future development will add vibrancy to Holland Village, said the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Wednesday (May 16).

Speaking during the third day of parliamentary debates on the President’s Address, the Workers' Party MP said this is important, with education being seen as a key enabler of social mobility in Singapore. While the Ministry of Education has put in place measures, they may be insufficient, he added. For instance, the promotion of interaction among students of all backgrounds through initiatives such as applied learning seem to have yielded results that are “rather fleeting in nature and confined to small groups of students each time”. Such interactions that are \"rather piecemeal in nature ... would not even put a dent to the class divide issue\", he said. Parents who can afford to enrol their children in expensive tuition and enrichment classes, in the hope of improving their children’s grades, will also continue to do so.  “This will perpetuate the message that if you have the money, your child will stand a better chance of getting good grades. The lack of diversity in our schools will only grow.” On this note, Mr Png reiterated a suggestion he made in 2016 - for students whose PSLE results put them in the top tier of their primary schools to be granted a place in the secondary schools of their choice. Describing it as a “fundamental change” to the Secondary 1 posting exercise, he said this will “ensure a good mix and spread of students from all primary schools going into the popular secondary schools”. This will also introduce diversity into the “so-called elite schools” and prevent elitism. Mr Png stressed that his proposal is still based on meritocracy “but at the local level”.  “They’ve certainly earned their place in direct admission to a school of their choice by finishing top in their respective primary schools.”  Referring to President Halimah Yacob’s calls for bold changes and inequality to be tackled “vigorously”, Mr Png also asked if the Education Minister would do “something bold in the area of equitable funding” for local schools. “All schools are created not equal because the funding per school is different to begin with,” he said.  Mr Png reasoned that based on funding per student, popular schools with more students “will always have more funds by default”, while “shrinking neighbourhood schools will always struggle” to fund its extra enrichment programmes.  He said it is also a known fact that popular schools find it easier to raise additional funds from their “well-connected alumni”. “Does the minister not agree that it makes a world of difference when smaller neighbourhood schools are resourced with the same amount of funding as the popular schools?” Mr Png asked. “Is the minister willing to do something bold in the area of equitable funding for all schools?”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/social-inequality-lack-of-diversity-png-eng-huat-parliament-10239986"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 07:24PM", "tags": ["weather", "Met Service"], "author": "", "title": "Expect a wetter second half of May: Met Service", "content": " SINGAPORE: Expect an even wetter second half of May, with the Meteorological Service of Singapore forecasting more rain and warm weather.  Moderate to heavy short-duration thunderstorms are forecast between the late morning and afternoon on six to eight days in the next fortnight, said the Met Service on Wednesday (May 16). \"In addition, in the last week of the month, the eastward passage of Sumatra squalls could bring widespread thundery showers accompanied by occasional gusty winds to Singapore between the predawn hours and early morning on two or three days,\" said the Met Service.

MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Darryl David suggested the setting up of autonomous specialised primary schools to cater to “neurodivergent students” with unique learning needs. Referring to President Halimah Yacob's speech on the importance of making Singapore a great place to have children and to enable people with differences to lead full and active lives, Mr David suggested that such schools can enhance current education options, especially for those of primary school-going age.  He said that neurodivergent students possess neuroatypical conditions that are not so severe or challenging that would require them to enrol in Special Education (SPED) schools or Pathlight - which caters to children with special education needs - but find it challenging to cope with their conditions in mainstream primary schools. “These students are not just able to merely grasp the mainstream primary school academic curriculum, many of them are even able to excel in it,” he said.  However, the class sizes, environments and curricula of the mainstream school are \"not ideal\" for neurodivergent students who have differentiated learning needs, he added. “Aside from the environment and learning spaces, such schools could be given the freedom to design their own curriculum, determine their own class sizes, hire their own staff with the specialised skill sets and even set their own fees. This would be in line with the Pathlight model, but perhaps on a smaller scale, and with more autonomy given to the schools,” he suggested. The inclusion of those with special needs can also be extended to the national upskilling movement SkillsFuture, said MP for Jalan Besar GRC Denise Phua. She applauded MOE for including adult learners in its mission and asked if the same can be done for adults learners with special needs who are most at risk of being left behind. “For the non-traditional workforce such as those with special needs, the SkillsFuture movement has not yet made them its priority and accorded the attention it deserves. This will be a non-traditional workforce that can be tapped upon,” Mrs Phua said. Competent special schools, lifelong learning institutions and Continuing Education and Training (CET) providers can be tapped on to develop a SkillsFuture plan for adult Singaporeans with special needs, she suggested. SWITCH UP LITERATURE LIST TO FEATURE ASIAN CLASSICS MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC Chong Kee Hiong said that the education curriculum should be updated to reflect changing geopolitical environments. “Geopolitics have changed much and so have technologies. Have we made the necessary changes fast enough? Take the field of education. We need to constantly review the relevance of what we teach and how we assess our young,” Mr Chong said. Mr Chong suggested a revamp in the subjects taught and tested for O and A levels and that students should be exposed to literature beyond Shakespeare. “With the pivot to Asia, shouldn’t our students be exposed to great Asian classics such as the Dream of the Red Chamber, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Ramayana in addition to works from Shakespeare?” Mr Chong said. “Basic and general knowledge in all subjects lay a useful foundation but do we need so many students studying calculus or chemical interactions in such depth?”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/make-education-more-inclusive-parliament-president-address-10239912"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 07:14PM", "tags": ["Chia Shi-Lu", "Medisave", "MediShield Life"], "author": "Jalelah Abu Baker", "title": "More liberal use of Medisave among suggestions to improve healthcare landscape", "content": " SINGAPORE: Medisave could be used more freely, especially for outpatient treatments, and visits to family doctors could be exempted from GST, Dr Chia Shi-Lu has suggested. Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday (May 16) in response to the President’s address, Dr Chia, who is the chairman of the government parliamentary committee for health, proposed these changes to “smoothen some bumps and ripples in our healthcare landscape, to remove some friction where it is not needed, and to promote more equal access to medical services”. “I propose that we think about liberalising the use of Medisave in a bolder and more decisive manner,” said Dr Chia, who is MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC. While Dr Chia acknowledged that the introduction and expansion of schemes by the Ministry of Health like the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) and Flexi-Medisave are effective, and allow greater use of Medisave for medical scans, he said they can be complex and at times too restrictive. “The concern, of course, is that too loose a policy on Medisave withdrawals could lead to earlier depletion of our accounts, leaving nothing for us to rely on in later years when medical needs and expenses could be greater,” he said. He added that this concern is not necessarily well-founded, as the mean Medisave account balances have been increasing over the years, and a significant number die with remaining balances in the account. He also proposed changes that he said would help those above retirement age. MORE HELP FOR ELDERLY PAYING BIG AMOUNTS OUT-OF-POCKET Dr Chia suggested that Singaporeans above the retirement age be allowed to pay for up to 80 per cent of their subsidised outpatient treatment costs at Government clinics through Medisave, regardless of how much the amount comes to, subject to a doctor’s certification. This is because for some Singaporeans with multiple chronic diseases, or whose illnesses cannot be adequately controlled by medicines on the Standard Medication list, the out of pocket cash outlay for medical treatment, even at a polyclinic and with Pioneer Generation benefits, can be quite high due to the current utilisation limits for Medisave, he said. This move would not change matters for the majority of elderly patients, for whom the current chronic disease withdrawal limit would adequately cover 80 per cent of their annual outpatient treatment costs, he added. “But it could make a meaningful difference to the elderly with multiple or less common conditions requiring more specialised and expensive medications, or who require more medical investigations to better manage their conditions,” he said. Presently, a patient who has exceeded his Medisave claims limit and who finds it challenging to pay the remainder in cash, can appeal to the Ministry to withdraw more from his Medisave, apply to welfare schemes, or simply choose to forego treatment in excess of what he is willing to pay for in cash. “I am of the opinion that such further loosening of the Medisave purse strings would not lead to over-servicing or over-consumption,” he added, pointing to how the introduction of a Pioneer Generation package with generous benefits in 2015 has not led to worrying levels of over-consumption or over-servicing within the public healthcare system thus far. When it came to GST exemption for primary medical services, Dr Chia said that while philosophically this is a slippery slope, in practical terms it would be “in keeping with the intent of current policy that already absorbs GST from subsidised healthcare services”. “Removing this consumption tax from all primary healthcare services could nudge more patients back to their family doctors for care and encourage compliance with treatment and follow-up, by reducing costs,” he said. Dr Chia, who is a senior consultant in Singapore General Hospital's department of orthopaedic surgery, stressed that his suggestion referred only to primary care services, which can be defined and licensed, and not for hospital or other types of medical care. INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CONDITIONS RELATED TO PREGNANCY AND MENTAL HEALTH Dr Chia also suggested that gaps in MediShield Life, introduced to provide universal health insurance, should be plugged. Presently, pregnancy-related complications, and conditions related to mental health, are not covered under the scheme when hospitalisation is required. “I believe that we should consider expanding coverage to these conditions as well. We have been strongly encouraging parenthood, and it would serve as greater assurance to would-be parents that the mother’s medical care can be covered in the uncommon instances of complications related to the pregnancy,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/parliament/more-liberal-use-of-medisave-among-suggestions-to-improve-10239910"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 07:12PM", "tags": ["AVA"], "author": "", "title": "Company fined S$6,000 for illegal import of fresh fruit, vegetables", "content": " SINGAPORE: A company was fined S$6,000 on Wednesday (May 16) for importing fresh fruit and vegetables from Malaysia without a valid permit, said the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) in a press release.  About 1.17 tonnes of undeclared produce was uncovered in two lorries at Woodlands Checkpoint last November.  The importer, TCM Fruits and Vegetables, did not declare the assorted produce in the import permit, said AVA, adding that the illegal consignments were seized and destroyed.  Another charge for illegally import of processed vegetables was taken into consideration in sentencing.  \"Illegally imported food products are of unknown sources and pose a food safety risk,\" said AVA.  \"In Singapore, the food imports must meet AVA's requirements and food safety standards.

Beh Dien Dien, 45, had previously received and acknowledged eight warnings from the police, informing her that numerous women had been arrested for prostitution and massage activities at the various units she rented out at People’s Park Complex. Still, she \"turned a blind eye\" to the warnings and continued to rent rooms out to tenants without checking their background or occupation, according to court documents. On one occasion, Beh moved one of the women to a room in a different unit, after the woman was arrested at her apartment for prostitution, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Lai. Beh also only allowed her to do so if the woman, Xiang Anmei, finds a man to sign a tenancy agreement with Beh. This was so that if the police were to raid the unit, Beh would be able to distance herself from Xiang by saying she had rented the room out to the man. Beh was found guilty last month of one charge of renting out her property with the knowledge that it would be used as a brothel, and two charges for knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution from two women, Xiang, and Li Hong Juan. Both women are China nationals. According to court documents, although Beh did not stay in the building, she had a total of 27 rooms for rent in various units. She would get tenants from advertisements and recommendations by fellow landlords and tenants. She received a total of S$8,600 in rent from Xiang and Li. A NEGLIGENT AND CARELESS LANDLORD?  During the trial, Beh claimed she did not know that the apartment was being used as a brothel, with defence lawyer Patrick Tan presenting her as a “negligent and careless landlord” at most. But the prosecutor stressed that this portrayal of her \"illustrates her readiness to shift legal and moral culpability away from herself\". He added that Xiang and Li had both testified during the trial, and both said that Beh knew they were prostituting themselves in the apartment. On one occasion, the air-conditioner in Li’s room had broken down, and Li called Beh to tell her about it. When Beh wanted to come up to the room and repair it, Li had said that she had a customer and would be busy. According to Li’s testimony, Beh then asked Li if she could wait for 10 minutes. This meant, according to Li, that she should wait for 10 minutes before bringing the customer up to the room, so that Beh could avoid meeting the customer. “A reasonable landlord would have been concerned about their tenants receiving customers at the unit, but this was not the case for (Beh),” said the prosecutor. Court documents also showed that Beh had charged Xiang and Li S$2,200 a month and S$3,000 a month respectively in rental fees. However, another tenant of the accused, who was not involved in prostitution or massage activities, paid just S$500 a month for a room without an en-suite bathroom. “This clearly showed the disparity in rent between a prostitute and a non-prostitute,” said the prosecutor. He also pointed out that Beh’s husband, Chan Kok Poon, who co-owned the apartment, had been convicted and sentenced in March on a similar charge. Beh indicated that she would appeal against the conviction and sentence.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jail-fine-for-landlady-who-turned-a-blind-eye-to-prostitution-10239806"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 06:10PM", "tags": ["crime"], "author": "", "title": "Two men arrested for robbing 73-year-old taxi driver", "content": " SINGAPORE: Two men suspected of robbing an elderly taxi driver have been arrested, the Singapore Police Force said in a news release on Wednesday (May 16).

Now it's about the team coming to a consensus on the best option,” he said, while adding that the fourth-generation (4G) ministers being able to work together was “as important, if not more important, than the question of who will be the next PM”. \"I know everyone is anxious to know who the next PM will be ... These things take time. They cannot be forced,\" said Mr Lee. \"I do not believe we are ready to settle on a choice yet. Nor is it helpful to treat this either as a horse race or a campaign to lobby support for one candidate or the other. \"This is a team game, and we want a strong, cohesive team so Team Singapore is the winner.\"  Speaking on politics and leadership as part of a wide-ranging speech delivered in Parliament, Mr Lee asked: \"Can the next generation of leaders build on our shared experience of 50 years, and maintain the sense of collective mission? Can they work to improve the lives of all Singaporeans, and not the interests of narrow groups, so that they pass on an even stronger and more united Singapore? “I think they can.” He praised the 4G ministers as a strong team willing to serve and with their hearts in the right place, while dishing out some advice for them. “Some hard truths will always remain for Singapore. But even old problems may need new solutions. We must be pragmatic and not ideological in our approach,” said Mr Lee. “Keep an open mind, and make decisions both with the head and the heart. Remember our history but don't be trapped by it. “That is why leadership renewal is crucial: New ideas, new bonds and new connections are needed with every new generation.” “IF WE EVER FAIL … WE DESERVE TO LOSE” Mr Lee also touched on opposition parties and their role in keeping Singapore’s politics “contestable”. “The ruling PAP (People’s Action Party) does not have a monopoly of power, does not have a right to rule Singapore indefinitely,” he stated. “So long as the PAP government performs, it keeps the voters’ support, and stays in power. The opposition cannot gain ground. But if the PAP government becomes incompetent or corrupt, the opposition will grow. “So our system gives the PAP government every incentive to perform, and to keep the opposition performing its role where it is, namely in the opposition.”  Added Mr Lee: “The PAP is determined to perform. We treat every election as a serious contest. We take every debate in the House seriously. And that's why we amended the Constitution to ensure that there will always be at least 12 opposition MPs and NCMPs in the House, whatever the outcome of the general election.” Political parties do not have a fixed lifespan – a time to live and a time to die, he noted. “How long a political party continues in government – or in opposition for that matter, because parties come and go in opposition too – depends on whether it can renew itself, continue to serve the people, continue to bring progress to the nation,” said Mr Lee. “If the PAP can keep on successfully doing that, we can stay in Government. But if we ever fail, we deserve to lose. So my message to all PAP MPs is ‘work hard, serve the people, hold the ground, win the elections’.” “If ministers are not prepared to govern, then give it up,” he added. “Governing means from time to time you have to do difficult things, when they become necessary. Leadership means you've got to explain, persuade, and convince people that you know what you're doing, you're doing it for good reason, you're doing the right thing. “That is the way to maintain people’s trust, and trust is crucial.” After Mr Lee's speech, opposition leader and former Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang stepped up to ask if there was \"now a political elite class\" in Singapore, given the touted three front-runners to be the next prime minister - Chan Chun Sing, Heng Swee Keat and Ong Ye Kung - all hail from military or civil service backgrounds. \"This is an example of the way not to think about the problem,\" Mr Lee replied. \"When you look at the person you ask: 'Is he making a contribution? What are his strengths and weaknesses ... does he or does he not measure up?' \"You don’t ask where did he come from, who his parents are.\"  He continued: \"Is it bad to come from the civil service or the SAF? No. Is it necessary to come from there? No. Is it good to have people from a wide range? Yes, and we do have a wide range. \"He talked about three front-runners. I don’t know how many people are running. I just said it's not a horse race, it is a team,\" said Mr Lee. \"So we are looking for people, wherever we can find them, to bring in to form a Singapore team. And the stronger this team is, the harder I make Mr Low’s job. \"I can't help it. It wasn’t my objective,\" he said, smiling. \"I just want the best team for Singapore.\" IMPORTANCE OF TEAMWORK In closing, Mr Lee returned to stressing the need for Singapore’s political leadership to work together. “Even in the best of times – and certainly in times of severe crisis – Mr Lee Kuan Yew did not run the country by himself. Neither did Mr Goh Chok Tong, nor myself,” he observed. “All three of us were not sole leaders, but primus inter pares – that means first among equals – with our colleagues. We were all fortunate – Singapore was fortunate – that the PMs had such stalwart colleagues. “Mr Lee had a core team, very strong ministers supporting him – Goh Keng Swee, S Rajaratnam, Lim Kim San, Hon Sui Sen, Othman Wok. ESM Goh had a talented team too – Ong Teng Cheong, Tony Tan, Wong Kan Seng, S Jayakumar, S Dhanabalan, Abdullah Tarmugi, George Yeo, just to name a few,” Mr Lee recalled. “When I took over as Prime Minister, I inherited ESM Goh’s strong team, Mr Goh himself stayed on, and we added talent to his team. Now he's stepped down, I rely on my own core team, which now also includes several of the 4G ministers. “So the next PM must have, and will have, his own stalwart colleagues too.” He reiterated that the Government was not the owner of Singapore, nor its manager, but a steward. “It is responsible for taking good care of the country, holding it in trust, handing it on in due time for future generations,” Mr Lee explained. “The Government must keep faith with past generations who gifted this country to us. It has to be responsible to the present generation who continue to build on what we have inherited. “But above all, it must consider future generations, whose lives and whose futures depend on us, the present generation - thinking of their interests, acting on their behalf, making wise and far-sighted decisions to cause Singapore to endure and flourish for many more years,” he said. “I am confident that when the time comes for me to hand over to a new Prime Minister, Singapore will be in the hands of good stewards.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/candidate-next-pm-lee-hsien-loong-prime-minister-10239190"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 03:45PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Loong", "Mahathir Mohamad"], "author": "", "title": "PM Lee to meet Mahathir in Malaysia on Saturday", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will meet Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia on Saturday (May 19), he said in Parliament on Wednesday. “The expectations of the new Malaysian government are very high, and I think Dr Mahathir will be very busy in the days to come. But I plan to visit him on Saturday, and tell him I look forward to working with him again for mutual benefit,\" Mr Lee said during the debate on the President's Address.

In his speech during the debate on the President’s address on Wednesday (May 16), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said there are four indicators: When every child has a good start in life, regardless of which family they are born in; when every talent is recognised and developed to the fullest; when every opportunity is open to anyone with the right attitude and ability; and when a capable person faces minimal social impediments to be accepted, to contribute and to lead in society. However, the last part is the most difficult to sustain in the long term, Mr Lee added. “We want Singapore society to maintain an informal and egalitarian tone, where people interact freely and comfortably as equals and there are no rigid class distinctions or barriers that keep good people down,” he said.    This, however, is beyond the Government’s ability to bring about alone; society has to be open and permeable, the prime minister pointed out. Society should also be aware of markers that can signal and entrench class differences, such as language and lifestyle choices, he added. “We must discourage people from flaunting their social advantages,” Mr Lee said. “We should frown upon those who go for ostentatious displays of wealth and status, or worse, look down on others less well off and privileged.” “We should emphasise our commonalities, not accentuate our differences.”  ELITE GROUPS MUST NOT BE CLOSED OFF Mr Lee also addressed the issue of elite groups that become closed circles and prevent others from being admitted. He said every society has its elite and they occupy the key leadership positions in society, whether in government, academia, business or as professionals. They share similar backgrounds, interests and social spaces, and may be alumni of the same schools, have done business with one another or worked in the same professions, he added. Such social networks are “natural structures” in society and are useful for people to know one another, get things done informally and feel a collective sense of responsibility for the society, the prime minister said. “But social networks must always remain open and permeable,” he cautioned. “They must not close up; they must not form a glass ceiling.” He added: “It must not be difficult or impossible for others with talent or ability but lacking the right backgrounds and connections to be welcomed into the elite group, to rise to the top.” Citing the example of Raffles Institution (RI), Mr Lee said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung had shared with him that the popular Singapore school, with a strong tradition of accepting eligible students from diverse backgrounds, has become less diverse over the years. The school principal is addressing this by speaking to parents of potential students in primary schools across Singapore to encourage them to apply to RI, but some parents told him they did not want to do so, the prime minister said. And it’s not because their child cannot keep up with academic demands, but because of the fear that they might not fit in with other more well-off students, he added. But “this fear is actually unfounded”, Mr Lee pointed out, as RI students still come from varied backgrounds with just over half – or 53 per cent – living in public housing. He said the Ministry of Education will work with them, and other popular schools, to make sure they never become “self-perpetuating, closed circles”. Additionally, measures such as setting aside places in primary schools for children without affiliation are in place, and Mr Lee said the Government “will do more if necessary”. The prime minister also said the Government is non-ideological and pragmatic, willing to try anything that works to improve social mobility, but it “must also be realistic”. Suggestions like a universal basic income and abolishing the PSLE have been mooted in the past, he noted, but the former has so far been “unproven anywhere” while the latter is “very hard to do”, and educators and parents have very different views on it. In the end, the Government “must focus on practical, effective policies”, he said. NATION-BUILDING “ALWAYS A WORK IN PROGRESS” As for social cohesion, Mr Lee said Singapore has made “much progress” in nation-building over the past 50 years, and the nation is much more cohesive now, but it will always be a work in progress because the forces that pull Singaporeans in different directions “never go away”.  Race, language and religion are “enduring fault lines”, the prime minister pointed out. For instance, the influence of China and India on the ethnic groups here continue even as these nations grow in strength and confidence. “It will be a very long time before we become immune to their ethnic, cultural or economic pulls,” he said. As such, the country must work at building bridges in these areas, as well as between different groups in society such as those between unions and management, and between citizens old and new. On the latter, Mr Lee said immigrants are “part and parcel” of Singapore’s history and identity, and the country needs a steady flow of immigrants to top up its population. But first-generation immigrants will always take time to settle down and understand the nuances of Singaporean culture and character – as did the previous waves of first-generation Singaporeans, he said. “The new arrivals have chosen to make Singapore their home, and will contribute to our country, our society. They have to make every effort to mix and interact with everyone else,” Mr Lee said. “For our part, we should welcome them, we should support them in their journey to becoming Singaporeans, as others have helped us and our forefathers.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-society-must-maintain-informal-and-egalitarian-tone-pm-10239110"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 03:15PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Many possibilities to grow economy, reinvent and redevelop Singapore: PM Lee", "content": " SINGAPORE: Keeping the economy growing is one of the Government’s top priorities and there remains many possibilities to do so, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Parliament on Wednesday (May 16). Amid the ongoing push with economic restructuring efforts, opportunities can be seen, said Mr Lee during the debate on the President’s address. “The only question is whether we can seize them,” he said. Mr Lee raised the digital economy as an example and described how neighbouring countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, are witnessing “lively” technology sectors. In Indonesia, four unicorns – companies that are worth at least $1 billion in value – have been produced. “If we can build up our own tech sector while connecting with theirs, we will prosper together,” said Mr Lee. Singapore is making “good progress” developing frontier technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), financial technology (fintech) and advanced manufacturing, he added. For instance, the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has built up a reputation as a leading centre in AI. It also partnered Alibaba to open a research institute on AI, marking the Chinese Internet behemoth’s first such institute outside China. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has also developed Singapore into a fintech hub within the last two to three years, said Mr Lee. More than 400 fintech firms are now based here, alongside over 30 innovation labs and research centres set up by multinational companies (MNCs). In advanced manufacturing, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) is collaborating with MNCs, local companies and universities to develop new technologies in aerospace and precision engineering. Citing the joint laboratory set up with Rolls Royce and Singapore Aero Engine Services last year, Mr Lee said: “These projects will create good manufacturing jobs. SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises) will benefit and so will workers because through these research collaborations, they get access to the latest technologies.” Mr Lee added that Singapore is in a “strong position” at the moment after having “grown steadily” for the past five decades. “We have enjoyed high growth for much of this half century – even from time to time exceeding 10 per cent per annum,” he said. “Since independence in 1965, our GDP has grown more than 40 times in real terms.” But as the economy became more developed, the country’s growth forecast has moderated to two to four per cent.  Mr Lee noted that this moderation in growth figures “has made some people anxious”.  “They worry that their children will not have better lives than they themselves do today.” However, these numbers have to be put in perspective and he noted that “2 to 4 per cent is in fact quite good for a mature economy”. Mr Lee added that other developed economies like South Korea and Taiwan are also growing at around this rate, while Japan is expanding at a slower pace. In addition, this growth range is “just an estimate, based on our current stage of economic development”. “It is not the limit to our efforts or to our ambitions. Individual companies and individual industries can certainly do better, especially if they come up with a more innovative product, or if they expand into new markets,” said Mr Lee. “So there are many possibilities for us to grow our economy, and to reinvent and redevelop Singapore.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/many-possibilities-to-grow-economy-reinvent-and-redevelop-10238750"}, {"datetime": "16 May 2018 03:09PM", "tags": ["Lee Hsien Loong", "US-China"], "author": "", "title": "US-China tit-for-tat threatens global prosperity: Lee Hsien Loong", "content": " SINGAPORE: Trade tensions between the US and China hurt business and their unilateral, “tit-for-tat” actions undermine the multilateral trading system - thus threatening global prosperity, especially for smaller countries like Singapore, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (May 16). Speaking in Parliament, Mr Lee described how globalisation has come under pressure, with Western countries in particular “questioning the benefits of openness and free trade”. He said the American administration under President Donald Trump now feels “that other countries are benefitting more from the global system, and at the expense of the US”. “They want to make sure that the US will always benefit directly – item by item, country by country,” said Mr Lee. Trade has emerged as a top issue for the US and especially in wider relations with China, he noted. “The US is still stronger, especially militarily, but China is growing in power, influence and confidence … If there is mutual distrust and rivalry between the two, it is but a small step from a trade disagreement to a wider and more serious quarrel,” said Mr Lee. “The US and China are far from going to war with each other, but it is not clear which way their relations will tilt. “If they tilt towards more conflict, it will be bad not only for the two powers, but for the rest of the world as well ... But if relations tilt to the other extreme, and the two powers agree to divide up the world between them, and set rules that only benefit them, that would be just as detrimental, especially for small countries which have no say.” He added: “As a small and open country, Singapore will always be vulnerable to what happens around us.

The company told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday (May 16) it has started sending email to current fibre broadband subscribers and those who supported its mobility bid – referred to as “Friends of MyRepublic” – to inform them of two no-contract, SIM-only mobile plans. They are: Uno, a 1GB mobile data plan at S$8 per month, and Ultimate, an 80GB mobile data plan at S$80 a month. Both plans come bundled with 1,000 minutes talk time and 1,000 SMS, but the feature that stands out is something called \"Boundless Data\" – a feature that ensures users will not be charged for exceeding their data limit. Instead, MyRepublic said it will reduce the speed of the mobile data though it promises \"you’ll still be able to surf the Web, make calls, send messages, even stream music\". Additionally, its mobile subscribers can also add monthly recurring or one-time “data boosters” to increase capacity. The recurring add-ons cost from S$5 per month for 1GB, or from S$3.50 for a 500MB one-time boost. The two plans, however, are limited to those mentioned above and they will need to unlock MyRepublic’s mobile website with a code included in the email. “We’ve sent each of them five codes to share with their friends and family,” the company said, adding the codes should all be sent out “by the end of the week”.

It did not stop pursuing its plans to offer mobile services though, announcing a partnership with StarHub earlier this month to lease its mobile network and be a mobile virtual network operator targeting a younger, more tech-savvy crowd.  MORE MOBILE PLANS LATER Asked if these mobile plans will be available to the wider public later, company spokesperson Fabian Lau said it has “no plans to make them available to the public at this time”. He was also not able to share how many are eligible for the mobile plans. Users who sign up for the plans will have a SIM card couriered to them, after which they can get started. The earliest anyone can get on its mobile network is May 21, Mr Lau told Channel NewsAsia. Those who want to port their existing phone numbers are able to do so, but the spokesman said they need to make sure they are not bound by contract with other telcos or they may be liable for early termination fees. As for the commercial launch of MyRepublic’s mobile services, Mr Lau only said it will be \"soon\". The company said it will be launching more plans then, but cannot share details on these just yet, except “to say that we’re committed to providing our customers a worry-free mobile experience no matter what MyRepublic Mobile plan they are on”. As for handset bundle plans, its website said: \"That’s definitely something we plan to do, although we can't provide any further details on those plans right now.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/myrepublic-mobile-data-plan-no-bill-shock-10238564"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 11:33PM", "tags": ["food"], "author": "", "title": "Famous Hill Street Fried Kway Teow founder dies aged 71", "content": " SINGAPORE: The founder of Hill Street Fried Kway Teow in Bedok has died at the age of 71.

Mr Guy Rosen, vice president for Product Management at the social networking company, told Channel NewsAsia in an interview on Tuesday (May 15) that Singapore and India will be the two sites in the region to hold the Facebook Forums: Community Standards event. It intends to engage with civil society players like the Media Literacy Council, Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) and Maruah to see if they would be interested in participating, he added.  Their input is needed to help Facebook better “understand the local context” and setting in different markets, the executive explained.   The public forums were announced last month, the same time when Facebook released its internal guidelines for enforcing community standards as well as announcing it will give users the right to appeal decisions if the social network decides to remove photos, videos or written posts deemed to violate community standards.  In it, Ms Monika Bickert, vice president of Global Policy Management, said efforts to improve and refine these standards depend on participation and input from people around the world, and named countries like Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States as other countries it intends to hold these forums in.   Citing CEO Mark Zuckerberg, she said then the company won’t be able to prevent all mistakes or abuses “but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools”. As part of its efforts to address this issue, Facebook released for the first time its preliminary report for enforcing community standards on Tuesday, which highlighted the work it is doing around six violations: Graphic violence, adult nudity and sexual activity, terrorism propaganda, hate speech, spam and fake accounts. TOOLS FOR SELF-POLICING ON FACEBOOK? It is also stated earlier it is committed to double the capacity of its review team from 10,000 to 20,000 so as to work on cases where human expertise is needed to understand the context or nuance, such as hate speech.  Mr Rosen shared that while there are no review teams based in Singapore, there are people from the content policy team that are based here and are involved in work looking at child exploitation for instance. Asked if there is a need for a dedicated review team based here to understand local languages such as Singlish, the executive said there are no plans to do so but there are already reviewers within the team capable of understanding these languages.  He added that spreading review teams far and wide - “with a one- or two-men team in a far-flung outpost” - tends to increase enforcement errors. Instead, Facebook’s approach is to have bigger groups residing in “centres of excellence” in order to review the content on its platform, he explained.  On the issue of giving users more tools to police themselves on the platform, such as allowing users to decide turning on the masking screen to indicate graphic violence or nudity, Mr Rosen did not rule out that possibility and said he sees the value of these in certain circumstances. But these tools “have not been built yet”, he added. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/facebook-forums-to-discuss-community-standards-singapore-10235420"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 09:26PM", "tags": ["retail", "fashion", "entertainment", "AsiaMalls", "Century Square"], "author": "", "title": "Century Square mall to reopen in June, house returning label M)phosis", "content": " SINGAPORE: Century Square will reopen on Jun 6 following a S$60 million makeover, its operator AsiaMalls said in a statement on Tuesday (May 15).

These include reducing the speed limit for Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) such as e-scooters, building a good riding culture, and the impact of higher motorcycle COE prices on the lower-income group. Non-Constituency MP Dennis Tan called for the Government to consider lowering the speed limit for personal mobility devices (PMDs) such as e-scooters to 15 kilometres per hour across all surfaces. Currently, he explained, PMDs are allowed to travel up to a maximum of 25 kilometres per hour on park connectors, and he said that this is still an “unsafe speed limit”. “I would invite the minister to take a walk with me along a busy park connector and experience whether it is safe for PMDs to travel at that kind of speed in a park connector, especially during peak period,” he said. “Moreover, many PMD users exceed 15 kilometres per hour even on footpaths too.” ENFORCEMENT ALONE WILL HAVE “LIMITED EFFECT” IN BUILDING GOOD RIDING CULTURE In his speech, Mr Tan also pointed out the importance of building a good riding culture, which he said is “really lacking” at the moment. Citing examples such as accidents or near-misses with PMD users and pedestrians, or of people walking along footpaths or walkways being startled by inconsiderate cyclists or PMD users, Mr Tan also stressed the urgency of doing so at this point. He explained that that the Government has been focusing on shared bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) such as e-scooters, in its drive towards a “car-lite” city with active mobility for the first and last-mile connectivity for public transport. “If the Government truly thinks that a 'car-lite' city as well as first-last mile connectivity are important for the future of our transportation system and will, in the President's words, play an important part in a metropolis that embraces the future, I feel that this is a critical moment for us to get it right as far as the safe and proper operation of transport modes for first-last mile connectivity is concerned,” he said. “We have to go about setting right this riding culture now, and if not we may miss the boat again,” he added. “That is why I am raising this issue here today.” GOVERNMENT’S APPROACH ON HIGHER MOTORCYCLE COE PRICES ‘NOT QUITE BOLD’: FAISAL MANAP Transport issues were also brought up by Mr Tan’s WP colleague, Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap, who raised the issue of higher motorcycle COE prices, and the impact of these higher prices on lower-income groups. “Why has the ministry not taken a bolder step in this area to regulate and improve the situation for the benefit of the lower-income?” he asked, adding that he has previously proposed measures to help this group be self-reliant.   “But the ministry’s response is that they are also very concerned about the financial hardship faced by the lower-income who are affected and burdened by the COE prices,” he said. “And they suggest this group visit the Social Services Office to get financial help.” “I do not quite agree with this approach,” he added. “Here, we can see how the ministry is 'not quite bold' in making changes to the COE policy for motorcycles, and in fact has adopted an approach that is rather contradictory to the principles that we have promoted.” Mr Faisal was referencing President Halimah’s point in her speech on the importance of the fourth-generation leaders to make bold changes, rather than being content with “tweaking things at the margins”.  “Existing policies that have become obstacles or are problematic and contradict efforts to achieve the people’s aspirations, should be revamped, improved or even abolished if necessary,” he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/debate-on-president-s-address-wp-mps-raise-transport-related-10236600"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 08:37PM", "tags": ["Gaza Strip", "Israel"], "author": "", "title": "MFA advises Singaporeans to avoid all travel to Gaza Strip, voices concern over violence", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has advised Singaporeans to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip and Israel's borders with it, voicing concerns about the latest escalation of violence in the area. “Singapore is deeply concerned about the civilian casualties arising from the latest escalation of violence along the Israel-Gaza border,” said an MFA spokesperson.  “We urge all sides to exercise restraint and do their utmost to protect civilians while taking urgent steps to de-escalate the situation.” “All parties have the responsibility to stop the violence and restore calm.” It advised Singaporeans to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip and Israel’s borders with the Gaza Strip, and added that non-essential travel to the West Bank, including Bethlehem, Jericho and Ramallah should be avoided.

Channel NewsAsia has contacted SCDF regarding the total number of reported cases over the years. In the May 2010 case, SCDF said it punished seven officers with detention ranging from 15 to 23 days after two new officers were coerced to undergo an initiation session at their fire station’s pump well. \"They entered the well, and one of them later reported the incident to the SCDF,\" it added.

Officers have been served detention of between three and 40 days in the examples highlighted.

Mr Zainal was speaking during the debate on the President's Address by Halimah Yacob last week, where she challenged leaders to “tackle inequality vigorously”. This, Mr Zainal said, is one of their “key defining challenges”. To that end, the Pasir Ris-Punggol MP urged the leaders to think and do things differently, in order to improve the lives of low-wage workers. “While the real wage increase for workers at and below the 20th percentile has increased because of tripartite efforts … we cannot expect to get better results if we keep on doing the same things,” he said. “Moving ahead, our 4G leaders must continually think differently to be able to catch and ride on the next `S’ curve of better income growth for low-wage workers.” Mr Zainal urged 4G leaders to direct industry stakeholders to think about how they can create inclusive growth in each of the 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) under their purview, Mr Zainal said. Each ITM committee should also contextualise the ITMs to see how they can help vulnerable workers make a future living, he added. This includes identifying skills that will be attainable by the aged or those with low educational qualifications. “This is important, otherwise we place our vulnerable workers at risk of having the progress made to better their lives amount to nothing in the face of inflation and technological disruptions,” he stated. WHAT CAN COMPANIES DO? Moving on to companies, Mr Zainal said they should live up to a sense of social responsibility by being fair and treating their employees, especially rank-and-file workers, better. This can be done by introducing new policies that focus on encouraging and incentivising companies to have good work culture, he said. “We have always taken pride in showing that Singaporeans are some of the most productive and highly-skilled workers in the world – yet reports on aspects such as happiness and work-life balance always seem to shed a different light,” he added. “To me, this is a sign that there is indeed a need for change.” Mr Zainal cited companies such as Gap, Starbucks and Walmart that have increased revenue by treating their employees better. This, he said, can come in the form of improved pay packages, generous worker benefits and a more positive work environment. “When workers are happy at work, they become walking ambassadors for these companies, often going beyond the call of service to do a good job,” he explained. “When companies don’t pay workers enough, everyone pretends they are working. They are not willing to ensure that jobs are carried out as they should be. Companies react by imposing punitive liquidated damages. Service providers are then forced to cut corners.” The latter situation, Mr Zainal said, creates a “vicious cycle” that involves driving down costs on labour, especially on rank-and-file workers. “However, labour needs to be … one where work is given the remuneration it is due, when the low-wage workers among us are not merely numbers in a contract, but treated as human beings with dignity and with dreams for themselves,” he added. QUALITY ECONOMIC GROWTH In the bigger picture, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Trade and Industry Tan Wu Meng, quality economic growth, combined with reinvestment in people and communities, is a “force against inequality”. “Singapore must never become a society where there is only old wealth, without new enterprise,” he said. To that end, the Government and businesses should work together to invest in workers and skills, he said, adding that growth can come from workers who have specialist or interdisciplinary skills, or those that create and implement innovative ideas. “Quality growth is part of the mission of our economic agencies – to create opportunities for young Singaporeans of all backgrounds by growing and transforming our economy,” Dr Tan said. BEWARE OF RASH CHANGES However, widening inequality has led Singaporeans to question the belief that they have an equal opportunity to improve their lives and achieve their goals, Potong Pasir MP Sitoh Yih Pin said. “Meritocracy works well, if the gap between the haves and the have nots is closer. This was indeed the case during the days of our parents and grandparents,” he said. “Now, income inequality is wider. The gap in resources available to families with higher income and those with lower income is stark.” Still, Mr Sitoh cautioned against rash changes, stating that there must be a “careful calibration of what requires ‘tweaks’ and what should be ‘boldly’ changed”. “Can the next generation leadership team exercise political leadership to ‘tweak’ or ‘boldly’ slaughter any ‘sacred cows’ where necessary?” he asked. Nevertheless, Mr Sitoh urged Singaporeans not to give up on values like meritocracy, equal opportunities and self-reliance. “While the task of ‘tweaks’ or ‘bold’ changes to policies or mechanisms put in place to address inequality is crucial, of equal importance is the need to imbue and inspire the belief amongst Singaporeans,” he said. “Once any number of Singaporeans loses this belief, social stratification will occur and our social compact will be broken.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/4g-leaders-tackle-inequality-improve-lives-low-wage-workers-10236148"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 06:51PM", "tags": ["NTUC", "digitisation", "labour market"], "author": "Amir Yusof", "title": "Labour MPs outline steps to boost workers' employability in face of digitisation", "content": " SINGAPORE: Several MPs from Singapore’s labour movement spoke on Tuesday (May 15) on the issue of jobs being potentially lost to digitisation, as they debated the President’s Address in Parliament.  President Halimah Yacob had touched on the need to change the way Singaporeans are educated to allow them to stay employable as industries and jobs change. Several ideas were mooted by the MPs on Tuesday to boost workers' employability in the face of technological advancements.  Assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Melvin Yong said that workers, companies and the government must reimagine the future of work, especially since automation, artificial intelligence and robotics become more mainstream and threaten to displace the jobs of today. Globally, up to 800 million workers are at risk of losing their jobs and be replaced by automation by 2030, according to a study from McKinsey Global Institute cited by Mr Yong, who is also MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC. “How would jobs look like in the next 10 to 20 years, with AI (artificial intelligence) possibly at the centre of most industries? We will have to reimagine the future in order to disrupt ourselves before we get disrupted,” Mr Yong said. Additionally, he stressed the need to re-design jobs, work processes and business models to be future ready, and emphasised on the need to reskill and upskill the existing workforce.   One way for workers to upgrade their skills on the go is through NTUC’s new mobile learning platform called U-Leap, Mr Yong said, explaining that the app gives users access to useful training contents on their mobile phone. “Spend 30 minutes a day, five days a week in the bus, on the train or during the lunch break – that would work out to a substantial 130 training hours a year, all done on the palm of your hand,” Mr Yong said. He suggested that the Government optimize current infrastructure to make learning convenient, for instance, by opening neighbourhood schools for night classes on digital skills. Fellow NTUC assistant secretary-general and MP for West Coast GRC Patrick Tay also spoke about the need to future-proof Singapore businesses and workforce. “As stakeholders, we need to use this time, while our workers are still employed, to upskill and prepare our workforce for the higher value jobs of the future so that when their current jobs are eliminated, they can still remain employed and employable,” he said. Mr Tay noted that while employers and employees may often feel inertia in preparing for change, there have been efforts by NTUC's Future Jobs, Skills and Training capability in developing a framework for collaborative action to change mindsets towards \"future-skilling\". “Stakeholders can work together at each stage of the framework to leverage on respective strengths for greater reach and effectiveness. These include efforts to address information asymmetry, raise awareness, inspire action, provide holistic support, create positive feedback loops and encourage the flourishing of change-agent mentality,” he said. PRIORITISE OLDER WORKERS IN CONVERTING SKILLS: HENG CHEE HOW Against the backdrop of Singapore's ageing workforce, NTUC's deputy secretary-general Heng Chee How spoke about how the Government can help older workers cope with changing technology and business models.  He urged authorties to intiate action to give older workers at least equal opportunity with younger workers to be trained, updated and upgraded.  Additionally, older workers who face displacement or who see better longer-term prospects in other occupations and industries should be given priority in helping them convert their skills.  \"Otherwise, the risk to both older workers and the system will snowball. And when the current technology or the business model is discontinued, entire occupations or industries will disgorge their irrelevantly-skilled older workers, and the help system may be overwhelmed by the volume,\" he said.  \"NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM\" Mr Desmond Choo, who is NTUC assistant secretary-general, acknowledged that some jobs are at risk of being made redundant. These include administration, executive, finance assistants, as well as traditional manufacturing operators. Mr Choo cited telemarketing and call center jobs as examples of work that are already replaced or complemented by AI. While technology has triggered “speculation” that many jobs could be lost, Mr Choo maintained that technology creates more jobs than it destroys. “It is not all doom and gloom. The demise of human jobs has to date been largely over-exaggerated,” he said.  Mr Choo highlighted that automation has taken away jobs such as the bus conductor, but it has created a generation of route-masters and technicians – roles he described as “higher value jobs”.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/labour-mps-outline-steps-to-boost-workers-employability-in-face-10235790"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 06:06PM", "tags": ["Uber", "Grab", "Ang Hin Kee", "Parliament", "NTUC"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Strengthen support for freelancers, in light of Uber ‘disappearing act’: Ang Hin Kee ", "content": " SINGAPORE: The sudden exit of ride-hailing service Uber from Singapore caught many by surprise, and the entire episode left a \"bitter aftertaste\", said Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC Ang Hin Kee on Tuesday (May 15). Speaking in Parliament during the debate on the President’s Address, Mr Ang, who is also an executive adviser of the National Taxi Association and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association, proposed four areas where support for freelancers can be strengthened. Mr Ang pointed out that disruptive technologies will come and go, and Singapore can expect this trend to continue. Ride-sharing apps, he said, radically transformed the taxi industry and expanded job opportunities for freelance drivers. But he said that with Uber’s sudden exit, drivers had no one to turn to, as both Uber and Lion City Rentals offices were closed, and the senior management at Uber Singapore were uncontactable. “The whole episode left a bitter aftertaste,” he said. \"Perhaps, disruptive technology brings along with it disruptive management.\" He noted that he had spoken recently to the President of the Sharing Economy Association Singapore, who had assured him that the association's members desire to be responsible corporate entities to freelancers and consumers. But he questioned how freelancers embarking on the gig economy would not be left to deal with another \"Uber disappearing act”. STRENGTHENING SUPPORT FOR FREELANCERS IN FOUR AREAS For one, Mr Ang said that more can be done to educate job seekers and school leavers on what to look out for should they make freelancing a career option.  Next, he noted that the immediate needs of freelancers should be looked after, particularly in healthcare. He pointed out that some platform operators like Grab have started to make contributions to the Medisave accounts of the freelancers on their platform. “This is an encouraging move and parallels existing efforts by taxi operators to help cabbies with their Medisave,\" he said. The next step, he said, would be to give freelancers access to insurance products that protect them in the event of a long-term illness or injury. This is because the loss of income is particularly troubling for self-employed people if they are not able to work for an extended period. Third, he said that more government agencies should set up dispute resolution frameworks so that freelancers in their respective sectors can be better supported. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority, Ministry of Education and the Land Transport Authority already have a system for media freelancers, sports coaches and instructors, as well as taxi drivers. “Such dispute resolution systems allow freelancers to work through payment disputes with the production houses, schools or taxi operators,” he said. Finally, Mr Ang said that the \"buyers beware” principle also applies to freelancers. “It is important that regulators move quickly to ensure a support system is in place for our freelancers,” he said. “It is equally important that freelancers exercise caution towards platforms who do not want to be subject to or commit to tripartite standards, advisories and guidelines designed to do right by our workers.” In concluding his speech, Mr Ang expressed disappointment that Uber had let them down. But he stressed that Singapore remains an economy that welcomes new ideas, allows test-beds for innovation, and involves its local workforce in these “exciting ventures”. “Despite this Uber episode, we want to tell those with the best ideas and technologies to come to our shores,” he said. “We are prepared to share risks, and we are a city of innovation, of new adventure.” “However, an abdication of responsibility is not what we signed up for and should not be allowed to take root here - neither for our freelancers, nor for our workers.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/parliament/freelancers-uber-private-hire-strengthen-support-disappearing-10235978"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 05:59PM", "tags": [], "author": "", "title": "Noble Group narrows Q1 loss; business hit by weak funding", "content": " SINGAPORE: Embattled commodities trader Noble Group Ltd reported a smaller quarterly net loss as it enters a make-or-break phase ahead of shareholder meetings and legal rulings that will decide the company's fate. Once Asia's largest commodity trader, Singapore-listed Noble has shrunk its business after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years to raise funds and slash debt. Noble posted a net loss of US$72 million in the January to March period versus a loss of US$129 million a year ago, the company said. Revenue fell 37 percent to US$1.2 billion. It said the group's performance was impacted by continued constraints, with the business unable to take advantage of strength in global commodity markets. FROM US$11 BILLION TRADING TITAN TO PENNY STOCK Just seven years ago, Noble Group was a US$11 billion-plus Asian commodity powerhouse, trading everything from soybeans to oil. Amid accusations of false accounting levelled in 2015, and a legal spat this year, a long slide in investor confidence has seen most of Noble's market value wiped out.  Noble has defended its accounting and is now trying to clinch a last-ditch deal with creditors and shareholders from which - if it succeeds - it will emerge a transformed company. Noble is seeking approval to halve its US$3.4 billion debt in return for handing over 70 per cent of equity to senior creditors, mostly a group of hedge funds which calls itself the \"Ad Hoc Group\". Under that plan, its headquarters will be in London, not Asia, no longer controlled by founder Richard Elman. \"Noble's restructuring ... remains critical to averting bankruptcy,\" Singapore's KGI Securities said ahead of the Noble results. The deal would leave existing shareholders with just 15 per cent equity in a company that has seen its share price fall from a peak of S$17.6 Singapore dollar (US$13.18) in 2011 to below S$0.1. Despite its woes, Noble has so far defied talk of its demise. But to keep going, Noble needs a majority of its shareholders to approve the restructuring - a vote on the proposal is expected in June. GOLDILOCKS, BEARS Scared by the prospect of total loss and lack of any alternate plan, the proposal could get enough support, company sources say. Founder Elman, still Noble's biggest shareholder with a stake of nearly 18 per cent, would be given a board seat in the new firm. Noble chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring and liquidation expert, has urged shareholders to support the deal, threatening a failure would result in insolvency and bankruptcy. But leading the resistance is Abu Dhabi-based Goldilocks Investment Co. Ltd, which holds 8.1 per cent in Noble. Goldilocks has filed complaints and lawsuits against the restructuring plans, arguing they protect creditors at the expense of shareholders. Goldilocks is Noble's third-biggest shareholder after Elman and China Investment Corp, which has a 9.5 per cent stake. It's not just shareholders who are unhappy, though. One of Noble's business partners, Indonesian coal miner PT Atlas Resources, has also filed lawsuit against Noble and its chief executive William James Randall, alleging it was given false information related to asset sales. Shipping Indonesian coal to buyers in Asia is the biggest remaining business at Noble, which has said it plans to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it. 'NIMBLE AND MOTIVATED' In its glory days, Noble employed hundreds of traders, with ambitions to rival global rivals like Glencore. But with its market value a shadow of what it once was, and billions in debt, Noble has struggled to remain active. Instead of trading itself out of trouble, it was forced to sell off its core businesses, including oil and gas, to competitors Vitol and Mercuria. This, as well as some bad trading calls, meant Noble booked a whopping $5 billion loss in 2017 - despite a broad commodity market recovery. As a result, Noble was unable to join a share-price rally enjoyed by rival miners and traders like Glencore or Whitehaven Coal. For now, Noble fights on, seeking to make the best of its new look. Earlier in May, its gave a market presentation at a major coal trading event in Bali at which it described itself as \"small, but nimble and motivated\".", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/noble-group-narrows-q1-loss-business-hit-by-weak-funding-10236080"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 05:22PM", "tags": ["Ministry of Home Affairs", "terrorism", "POSSPA"], "author": "", "title": "New law giving police special powers to handle terror attacks to take effect May 16: MHA", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act (POSSPA), passed in Parliament on Mar 21 will be brought into force on Wednesday (May 16), the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a news release on Tuesday. Under POSSPA, the police will be able to use special powers to handle serious incidents, including terrorist attacks. MHA explained that there is a \"two-tier unlocking mechanism\" for POSSPA, and that the threshold is high.  In order for POSSPA to be activated, the Minister for Home Affairs must first authorise the use of the powers in the Act.  Subsequently, each special power under POSSPA has to be unlocked by the Commissioner of Police only as and when he assesses that the situation requires it, MHA said. \"Indeed, Singapore continues to face a clear and present terrorism threat, posed by home-grown radicalised individuals and foreign terrorists who view Singapore as a prized target,\" MHA added. \"POSSPA is part of these continuing efforts to combat terrorism.

To do this, the Government needs to listen to the voices of all segments of society, he said, while noting that there is not a singular message from the people. Instead, there is a \"a diversity of views, conflicting and complex, even as they remain compelling\". For instance, he said the call to abolish streaming assumes students all want to be in the Express stream. \"We also need to put ourselves in the students’ shoes ... Some prefer the pace of learning in the Normal streams. Many will tell you they prefer to be a big fish in a smaller pond, rather than a small fish in a bigger pond,\" Mr Ong noted. \"Many students in the Normal (Technical) course also like the more applied and hands-on curriculum, which they feel plays to their strengths.\" A similar call for the PSLE to be scrapped also ignores parents who in fact support the system, he said.  \"Because the PSLE experience teaches their children to work hard, and to demonstrate what they have learned throughout primary school years,\" Mr Ong explained. \"Many parents are also not overly stressed by it, because they don’t see PSLE as an exercise to chase for high marks, but rather as an objective and transparent way to decide which secondary schools their children will go to. The alternative, which is to go by residential location, is even more unfair.\" In any case, the PSLE T-score system will be replaced from 2021 with wider Achievement Levels - a change which Mr Ong called a \"big step\" in reducing academic stress and helping students enjoy learning more. Moving on to pre-school education, Mr Ong noted how Singapore has been growing the sector’s capacity and quality with the likes of MOE Kindergartens, where one-third of places are set aside for children from low-income families. He said the Government has also responded to calls for a programme rather than class-based approach, by ensuring more porosity between classes and streams. “For students in the Normal stream, we introduced subject-based banding where they can attend certain classes together with students in the Express stream,” said Mr Ong. “We introduced the Polytechnic Foundation Programme where good performing students can articulate directly to Polytechnics. I think more can be done in this area.” And to address feedback on stress and rote learning, non-essential curriculum has been cut down drastically, he said, adding that “long gone are the days where children are expected to do well just by memorisation\". To help the young from vulnerable families, policies like KidSTART are in place and aim to help 1,000 children over three years. Weaker students also receive aid through the Learning Support programme. Mr Ong also promised student care centres in every primary school by 2020. On admission policies, from 2019, secondary schools with affiliated primary schools will have to ring-fence 20 per cent of places for students without affiliation. This is on top of primary schools setting aside 40 places each for children without prior direct connections. Mr Ong then described SkillsFuture as “one of the best counters against inequality”. “If meritocracy is confined to academic excellence; success is defined narrowly as being a university graduate holding a professional or managerial position; then pathways will be limited, possibilities reduced and opportunities curtailed,” he said. “In Switzerland, 35 per cent of youths go to universities, while two-thirds of youths enrol in upper-secondary vocational and apprenticeship training. Children, together with their parents, make those choices at a fairly young age, based on their talents and interests, with little or no stigma associated with any of the choices. Society respects everyone.” Singapore has made some progress in this regard, said Mr Ong, but he added that “a lot more needs to be done”. “We will have to develop even more pathways and opportunities in our education and training system,” he commented. “Employers’ hiring and human resource practices have yet to wake up to this new mindset. Some employers have and I applaud them. “Societal mindset will take even longer to evolve. We will continue to improve our policies and we will not stop at these measures.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ong-ye-kung-education-inequality-10235268"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 04:58PM", "tags": ["Dining", "Ramadan", "Hari Raya"], "author": "Hidayah Salamat", "title": "Break your fast with rendang sushi and chick kut teh this Ramadan", "content": " Follow our new CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more dining stories and videos SINGAPORE: For Muslims, Ramadan is a time for quiet reflection and also an opportunity to spend more time with loved ones.

In a speech on tackling inequality, Mr Ong described it as a problem Singapore has wrestled with since its birth, and which remains unfinished business today. But each country’s situation is different, and unlike the growing underclasses and stagnating economic outlook of many developed countries, Singapore’s median income continues to rise. “Low- and middle-income families continue to experience real income growth and social mobility,” he said. “Singaporeans have been enjoying a rising standard of living and are motivated to do well. This is both a result of our culture - who we are - as well as public policies.”  He acknowledged that such transformation has created a set of problems as well, with a rising middle class facing difficulty in material progress due to Singapore’s high base; low-income families struggling to uplift themselves and some higher-income segments becoming socially distant from the rest. Mr Ong warned, however, that universal welfare was not the solution to all these problems. “Proponents argued that with universal welfare, there will be no stigma associated with social assistance, and the dignity of the low-income will be preserved,” he said. “A few countries have implemented universal welfare. But make no mistake, no handout is actually free. Someone has to pay for it.” He pointed out that in these countries, average income tax is about 30 per cent, with Goods and Services Tax (GST) at 20 to 25 per cent. “In Singapore, half of our population do not pay personal income taxes, and GST is still single-digit. If we want universal welfare, taxes on ordinary folks, including the middle-income, will have to be much higher,” Mr Ong explained. A better way forward would be to enable people to help themselves, he said. “What’s the difference? We make help available to them, but we also preserve their motivation, so that they continue to strive, instead of being passive recipients of welfare,” Mr Ong noted. GAP, CORE, CHURN, MIX Earlier Mr Ong outlined four dimensions to inequality: The income gap; middle-income core; mobility from bottom up and interaction between different groups.   On the income gap, he reminded the House how Singapore’s progressive tax system and other policies have worked to moderate disparity. He then stressed the importance of a strong middle-income core, pointing out how Singapore’s Gini coefficient is about 0.36, which is better than the US (0.39) and about the same as the UK, but higher than other European countries and Japan owing to their welfare systems. The closer it is to zero, the more equal the society. “The strongest evidence of a healthy middle-income group in Singapore is our changing lifestyles over time,” said Mr Ong. “Birthday and festive celebrations in restaurants, living in bigger HDB flats and ECs, family vacations overseas – these are not enjoyed by an exclusive few, but a broad middle. “The challenge ahead is that many middle-income families hope to do better, and for their children to be better off than them. But given the high base we are at, the climb is getting harder. We will still improve, but it will most likely be in steps and not in leaps,” he added. “We should also not define a better life purely in economic and material terms, but also other aspects of a holistic quality of life – from a more pleasant and greener environment, to a more cohesive and caring society, and with a greater pride in being Singaporeans.” On mobility, Mr Ong noted that 14 per cent of young Singaporeans, whose parents were in the lowest income quintile when growing up, managed to move up to the top quintile. This is a higher rate than the 7.5 per cent in US, 9 per cent in UK and 11.7 per cent in Denmark. Contributing factors to this include Singapore’s belief in meritocracy and public policies such as home ownership and universal access to good general education. “But the success of our policies have led to a new set of issues. Families who did well are able to pass down the privileges to their children, through better coaching, enrichment classes, and exposure to the world. Their children have a head start,” he acknowledged. “For families who cannot move up despite the strong and better support, we find their circumstances more dire and challenging than poor families of the past. Social stratification is starting to become entrenched.” Mr Ong then moved on to social mixing, noting how three public policies - housing, National Service and education - help nurture and reinforce a Singaporean culture of being “blind” to race, income and family backgrounds. “People are free to choose their friends and who they want to be with. But when groups are predominantly formed along socio-economic status – whether one is rich or poor - it is the start of stratification and that will poison society over time,” he stressed. “Our policies will need to work against this trend, to actively bring Singaporeans of all backgrounds together.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ong-ye-kung-inequality-handouts-universal-welfare-10235212"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 04:28PM", "tags": ["football"], "author": "", "title": "Fandi Ahmad to lead Singapore national team for 2018 AFF Suzuki Cup: FAS", "content": " SINGAPORE: Local football icon Fandi Ahmad will lead Singapore's national team for the 2018 ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Suzuki Cup, while the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) continues its search for a head coach.  A new national team head coach will be appointed from January 2019, FAS said on Tuesday (May 15). The association has been looking to fill the position since V Sundramoorthy stepped down, as announced last month. Fandi will remain as the Young Lions Head Coach in the Great Eastern-Hyundai Singapore Premier League. He continues to lead the Under-23 project, as well as next year’s Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and the 2020 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Under-23 Championship qualification, said FAS.  After the AFF Suzuki Cup, Fandi will \"continue to work closely\" with the new national team head coach to \"ensure continuity in the development pipeline\" from the Under-23s to the national team, the association added. The next national team head coach will be appointed with a view to build the national team from the youth level, said FAS.  This is \"to ensure that there is a structure in place that encompasses player development and a congruent style of play\" that will build Singapore’s competitiveness in international tournaments in the long-run. “The FAS Council has a long-term vision and plan for the national team,\" said FAS President Lim Kia Tong.  \"We do not want to hurry the appointment of the coach because we want the next national team coach to be able to bring the national team to the level we so desire, and to ensure that the national team’s style of play is one that the whole of Singapore will aspire toward.\" Singapore is drawn in Group B in the 2018 AFF Suzuki Cup and will face Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and the winner of the qualification round. The Lions will play the first match at home against Indonesia on Nov 9, 2018.

The 55-year-old has guided Young Lions to two wins and a draw in four league games so far this year, representing the team's best start to a season in recent times.  However, the Singapore Under-21 side crashed out in the semi-finals of the recent Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy under Fandi's tutelage.  Fandi's two eldest sons, Irfan and Ikhsan, are part of the senior national setup.  The Lions are currently ranked 172nd in the FIFA ranking. They are the sixth-highest ranking team in Southeast Asia, behind Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.  Speculation has been mounting as to who will fill the vacant head coach post, with names such as Home United’s Aidil Sharin as well as former England players Terry Butcher and Tony Adams mentioned in connection with the role.

This is the best solution because wages can only increase with productivity gains. Real wage increase is necessary to keep up with inflation, to cope with the cost of living.” But Singaporeans are not acting on these strategies fast enough, said Mr Ng at the opening of his speech. “Companies and workers must embark on this transformation journey now … The Labour Movement will need to push the transformation agenda by working even closer with Government and businesses,” said the Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office. He pointed out that Singapore currently enjoys high employment and real income growth for its workers, with median income rising almost 22 per cent in the last five years. But Mr Ng noted that workers were also “reasonably” worried about rising cost of living and making ends meet. “There are concerns about buying a home, about their retirement savings, about healthcare costs, and having enough for their children’s education,” he outlined. “They sometimes feel that no matter how hard they work, these needs may not always be adequately addressed.” THREE AREAS OF CONCERN Mr Ng said he was most worried by low-wage, mature and middle-aged, middle-income workers. He proposed expanding the use of the Inclusive Growth Programme to support sectors with low wage growth, and to ensure independent freelancers or project-based employees enjoy CPF protection, medical coverage and skills development. “I note that the Tripartite Workgroup for Freelancers and Self-employed is currently working in this area, and we are keenly watching their progress,” said Mr Ng. On the issue of mature workers, he said: “The real question here is whether employers are willing to employ senior workers instead of having the fixed mindset that these workers are a burden, more expensive and untrainable … For many of them, the job is essential – just like us, they have expenses, mortgages, and dependants relying on them.” The labour movement continues to work with companies to implement age management policies and practices, and the Government also subsidises employers the net cost of employing mature workers. But Mr Ng said the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices should be empowered to look into this area, and do more. “Furthermore, I propose to set up a new Tripartite Committee to provide better support for our ageing workforce, and help our mature workers to continue working if they choose to,” he added. Moving on to middle-aged, middle-income workers, Mr Ng commented that their earnings may just suffice to meet their needs, with their income growth not particularly high. “This is because some of their skill-sets are diminishing in demand, or they lack the opportunities to progress … similar to mature workers, the entrenched mindsets against hiring middle-aged workers is worrying,” he said. Mr Ng then briefly spoke about making the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) “real” for all working people, from professionals in the finance sector to workers on shop floors - by distilling the ITMs into actionable, purposeful training programmes. “It is critical that our businesses take the lead and do the right thing, that when our workers do their best, remember to share the gains with their workers and give them what is fairly theirs,” he said in conclusion. “We must continue to close social gaps by addressing the struggles of all our working people, especially the sandwiched middle-class and lower income workers. Help will always be available to those who need it, whether for employment, housing or education. “Those who have done better should reach out to the less fortunate. In Singapore, no one - no one - should be left behind.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ng-chee-meng-labour-movement-workers-ntuc-10235430"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 03:03PM", "tags": ["property", "private homes", "executive condominiums", "Urban Redevelopment Authority"], "author": "", "title": "New private home sales down 53% year-on-year in April", "content": " SINGAPORE: Sales of private homes by developers in Singapore fell about 53 per cent in April from a year ago, due in part to fewer new launches that month, according to data released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Tuesday (May 15). The coming months are likely to bring better sales, however, as more and larger projects go on the market, analysts said. Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), developers sold 729 units last month, compared with 1,567 units in the same month a year earlier and 716 units in March. Including ECs, 1,325 units were sold in April, a drop from the 1,938 units in the same period a year ago. “Contrary to what was expected earlier, only a few new projects were launched for sale in April, contributing to the low sales figures,\" said Mr Ong Teck Hui, national director of research and consultancy at JLL. In all, 654 new private homes were launched during the month, down 40 per cent from the 1,616 units launched last April, noted JLL. \"We think the relatively small project sizes of the new launches in April 2018 - coupled with raised prices in the limited remaining unsold stock – could have resulted in the slower pace of sales growth in April,\" added Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International. That said, Ms Song said that she expects sales to improve over the coming months, as more and larger projects – including the 1,052-unit Affinity at Serangoon and 613-unit Garden Residences at Serangoon North -  hit the market. JLL's Mr Ong added: \"With much publicity on the keen demand from buyers, strong take-up at launches and robust pricing, market interest is being drummed up to the benefit of projects awaiting launches. \"The 3.9 per cent rise in the URA property price index for the first quarter of the year suggests the possibility of a good upside in prices which would encourage an unhurried stance towards launches in order to capitalise on the price increase.\" Improved launch and sales figures can be expected in May, he added. For the full year, estimated Ms Song from Colliers, new home sales could rise by 19 per cent year-on-year to 12,600 units (excluding ECs) from the 10,566 units in 2017. Head of Research at Huttons Asia, Lee Sze Teck said: “If we were to look historically at the past 10 years, the average take-up for new projects was about 12,000 units a year. When we look back at 2014 to 2017, we’re actually selling way below that 12,000-unit mark. So there is a lot of pent-up demand in the market.\" In the EC market, 596 units were sold last month. Of this, 585 units were snapped up at Rivercove Residences, which launched 628 units. The project is the only EC to be launched this year. \"The Government has cut down on the supply of land parcels that are to be designated for executive condominium developments. So the supply of EC projects has dwindled quite a lot to about just one project expected to be launched each year,” ZACD Group executive director Nicholas Mak said. “Even though prices were very high, the take-up rate was also very strong – partly because of strong anticipation among potential homebuyers, and also the expectation that future EC projects could be even more expensive than the current one.\" Additional reporting by Wendy Wong.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-down-53-year-on-year-in-april-10235380"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 02:38PM", "tags": ["Land Transport Authority", "buses", "SMRT", "Tower Transit"], "author": "", "title": "LTA to buy 100 three-door buses after 'encouraging' trials", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has called a tender to buy 100 three-door buses based on positive commuter feedback and \"encouraging results\" of earlier trials, it said on Tuesday (May 15).  The buses will take to the road in 2020, it added.  As part of earlier trials, Tower Transit operated a three-door double-decker bus from  March to September last year, while SMRT operated a three-door single-deck bus from June last year to January this year.

The solution was developed in close partnership with Mindshare and Unilever. With audiences consuming more content across multiple screens, advertisers often struggle to achieve efficient buys across screens due to different measurement methodologies across digital and TV. Mediacorp has taken a huge step towards unifying linear and non-linear media buying by leveraging its wealth of media data points.  By owning all free-to-air TV channels and video-on-demand platform, Toggle, media budgets can be better deployed across video screens with the goal of improving reach at a better CPV. Campaign results using the blended CPV model have therefore exceeded expectations with key clients, notably Unilever's first campaign in the fast-moving consumer goods sector. Melissa Tang, managing director of Mindshare Singapore said: “Consumers are multi-screening, so the industry needs to adapt its approach to TV and digital video planning. Mindshare is delighted to be the first to collaborate with Mediacorp in developing a new model that is reflective of how people in Singapore are experiencing media today.” Blended CPV also maximises target audience reach at the most cost-effective rate. “The key benefit of blended CPV is that we can offer advertisers a screen-agnostic media buying solution that will reach audiences in a premium long-form environment regardless of the device they prefer.  \"This data-driven approach maximises target audience reach at the most cost-effective rate,\" said Jennifer Chase, vice president, digital sales of Mediacorp. Javed Jafri, channel communication manager of Unilever added: “We are constantly looking for partners in improving the efficiency and effectiveness in reaching more consumers. While TV remains a credible source of advertising, we need to adapt our multi-video solution to meet the changing consumer habits.  \"With Singapore being a multi-screen market, we believe multi-video solution will help us in creating meaningful relationship with our consumers.” The blended CPV buying approach paves the way for advertisers across many other sectors to run more efficient campaigns that truly mirror their audience’s cross-media habits.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mediacorp-s-new-cross-screen-buying-solution-enables-advertisers-10234638"}, {"datetime": "15 May 2018 08:10AM", "tags": ["GIC", "Brazil"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore's GIC buys S$37 million stake in Brazilian gym chain Smartfit", "content": " SAO PAULO: Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC is investing 100 million reais (S$36.9 million) in Brazilian gym chain Smartfit Escola de Ginastica e Danca SA, Smartfit said in a securities filing.

Has Singapore lost its competitiveness?", "content": " SINGAPORE: When Singapore company Razer chose to list in Hong Kong in 2017, the news made regional headlines. Razer’s listing followed not long after home-grown OSIM International had delisted from the Singapore Exchange and attempted to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as V3 Group. Whenever high-profile companies and organisations move out of Singapore as their places of business and choose a competing location, it is natural for many to wonder whether the city-state has lost its aura. Indeed, has the country lost its competitiveness? Many can still recall the spectacular merger a year earlier by Maersk Line, the world’s largest container shipping company, of its Hong Kong and Singapore offices. Maersk had then picked the former as its headquarters. Just this year, the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business completed its move from Singapore to Hong Kong with a new Asia campus to house its flagship executive MBA programme, which had run in Singapore for more than 15 years. SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO DO WELL IN GLOBAL RANKINGS By any yardstick, Singapore continues to do well in major global rankings. In the Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 compiled by the renowned World Economic Forum, Singapore was ranked third in the world after Switzerland and United States but attained a top place in Asia. In another study by the IMD World Competitiveness Centre, Singapore was ranked third globally. In more specialised studies, however, Singapore appears well ahead in the region. It was ranked top in the Asia-Pacific for the fifth straight year in the Global Talent Competitiveness Index released by INSEAD this April. Securing the second spot after Switzerland, it was the only Asia-Pacific country placed in the global top ten. Singapore was also number one in the world in the Global Smart City Performance Index done by Juniper Research released in March, ahead of next-ranked London and New York. READ: A commentary on the case for optimism on Singapore's economic growth figures. FAIR SHARE OF BIG NAMES Singapore still attracts and retains its fair line-up of regional headquarters of big companies like Apple, Bayer, Bridgestone, Chevron, Google, Hewlett Packard, Sony, Proctor & Gamble, and Unilever. Just last week, global healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson opened its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. But the worry is naturally the perception that initial public offerings or IPOs are on the decline. These are new listings on a stock exchange that seek new financial capital through shares. Looking at the bigger picture beyond Razer, the number of new listings has not declined in Singapore – this was 24 in 2017 compared to just 19 a year earlier. But there were comparatively more delistings of 27 in 2017 although this was a slight decline from the 30 in 2016. However, these numbers pale in comparison with those in Hong Kong, which saw 174 new listings in 2017 and 126 in 2016, several fold larger than Singapore’s. The race for new, big listings will remain intense. The famous Alibaba is an oft-quoted US$25 billion (S$33 billion) IPO that skipped Asia to list on the New York Stock Exchange. This enabled its unique governance arrangement to continue, whereby directors are appointed by a select group of top executives and investors, a feature prohibited even in Hong Kong. Alibaba is reportedly considering double listing now in Hong Kong where the stock exchange has been set to amend rules on “dual-class shares” so as to allow the company to list there too. Singapore likewise is on track to permit such listings through a liberalisation of its regulations which may well attract the next wave of Alibabas. The public consultation on the admission criteria and safeguards has just ended last month and implementation in the second half of this year looks likely. New regional IPOs may drive the impetus to further liberalise Singapore’s financial markets. Xiaomi the Chinese smartphone maker has just filed for an IPO in Hong Kong. Expected to raise more than US$10 billion, it will be the world’s biggest IPO since Alibaba. When OSIM relocated to Hong Kong, its founder Ron Sim lamented that its stock has not been fairly valued due to the lack of financial depth and liquidity in the Singapore exchange. This is true if we look at the statistics. As at end-2017, the domestic market capitalisation for Singapore and Hong Kong were US$787 billion and US$4.35 trillion respectively – Hong Kong’s total share value is 5.5 times larger than that of Singapore. More revealing is the average daily turnover value of shares – Hong Kong commanded US$7.96 billion as at end-2017 which is 9.4 times that of Singapore’s US$850 million. PROXIMITY TO CONSUMER MARKETS A KEY CONSIDERATION Beyond finances, proximity to large consumer markets is becoming a key consideration for IPOs. After being on the Singapore bourse for 16 years, OSIM decided on the move as it had 172 stores in mainland China and 35 in Hong Kong compared to only 26 in Singapore. Likewise, Alibaba’s pre-dominant market is China. This may be a key factor in its consideration to also list in Hong Kong - to tap financiers who are familiar or involved with domestic markets and are thus more amenable to invest in its shares. Singapore may lose out due to its distance to the big Chinese market and its large available pots of investor funding compared to Hong Kong or to even rising bourses like Shanghai and Shenzhen. This being so, it should reconstruct its unique selling point and redefine its relevance. First, Singapore has the clear advantage of being an access point to the ASEAN market. Singapore needs to play this ASEAN trump suit. Southeast Asia has a sizeable population of some 650 million, and a youthful one with a median age of 29 – compared to China’s median age of 37 even with its population of 1.4 billion. ASEAN is also the world’s third largest market after China and India, and surpasses market blocs like the European Union. Second, it is good that Singapore is strengthening its involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a huge market. Its coverage traverses across an inland Silk Road Economic Belt with multiple inter-country corridors as well as a Maritime Silk Road with several sea routes beyond Asia. The BRI is envisaged to connect some 65 countries and 4.4 billion people which is almost 60 per cent of the world’s population; it will account for one-third of global GDP and one-third of world trade in goods and services. In fact, total BRI investments at maturity are estimated at US$4 trillion which is 13 times Singapore’s GDP. Third, Singapore must not shy away from China - the elephant in the room when it comes to competition for foreign companies. But China’s tremendous growth offers as much opportunity as it does competition. The next thirty years is a period of opportunity, as China surges forward in its aim to become a fully developed country when it celebrates the 100th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China in 2049. For now, Singapore will have to take a leaf from the book of Chinese idioms: Strike while the iron is hot. In other words, tap on the increased spending and liquidity the Chinese market potentially offers as its economy develops and incomes rise. Singapore is not a sizeable market in itself. To thrive, it has to be a platform for the big markets. Singapore’s sustained success for competitiveness is really in the “ABC” – A for ASEAN, B for BRI and C for China.

These rituals are often designed to humiliate, rather than endanger, and used to mark the initiation of newcomers or milestones such as when personnel complete their National Service stint and reach their operationally ready date (ORD), the former servicemen said. Channel NewsAsia spoke to four men, who were based at various fire stations during their time as full-time national servicemen (NSF), all of whom requested anonymity.  On Monday (May 14), the SCDF announced that an NSF had died after being found unconscious at the bottom of a 12m-deep fire station pump well which was filled with water.  The NSF who died, Corporal (CPL) Kok Yuen Chin, had gone into the pump well at Tuas View fire station on Sunday as part of activities to celebrate his impending ORD with squad mates, SCDF said.  Two SCDF regulars - a staff sergeant and a first warrant officer - have been arrested.  FROM GETTING DUNKED IN A PUMP WELL TO BEING LOCKED IN A CAGE One former firefighter said that the ritual of kolam, or Malay for \"pool\", involves getting pushed into the well, which is used for training and testing of fire engine pumps. The aim of the challenge was to jump into what he called \"algae-filled water\". \"It's just a matter of not wanting to be in super dirty, algae-filled water,\" the 28-year-old said. \"So just jump in, get yourself dirty and get out.\" While the ex-firefighter said all soon-to-ORD personnel completed the ritual during his time as an NSF, he added that there were no injuries. \"We just had to make sure our heads were wet,\" he said, adding that there was a ladder available for the men to use. \"I don't know how (CPL Kok) could have drowned.\" Some of the other ragging activities practised include lathering shoe polish all over the skin of ORD personnel and putting them through blanket parties, he said. The latter involves covering the target with a blanket while they are asleep before clobbering them. The activities may also include inserting a battery into a person's anus, moving his entire locker onto the roof or locking them up in a cage, another former firefighter said. The aim of the practice is mainly to humiliate rather than cause danger to a person, a 27-year-old former serviceman told Channel NewsAsia. \"I've heard accounts of even more dangerous ragging, but these are generally (long-time) tales and are not practised anymore,\" he added. A former medic, 25, said ORD personnel would have to get an intravenous drip done by junior medics, or get soaked in water as part of their ragging ritual. As for the kolam practice, he said, junior firefighters would throw ORD personnel – who might be wearing heavy bunker gear – into the well. However, he added that kolam was not commonly meted out these days. \"In fact, they don't really practise kolam,\" he said. \"So, this is not really a common thing.\" DEEPLY INGRAINED CULTURE Despite stringent rules against the practice, ragging remains a \"deeply ingrained culture\" to initiate newbies and mark milestones such as ORD or a regular's retirement, said one ex-firefighter in his late 20s. \"Ragging was, and I’d like to believe still is, meant to be a good-natured way of fostering a sense of brotherhood, cohesion and team bonding amongst the firefighters,\" he said. But according to him, ragging is an offence that can carry a term in the Civil Defence Detention Barracks or the halting of promotions and bonuses for regulars. As such, as long as the activities were done discreetly, some officers would adopt a “don’t tell me, I don’t want to know” attitude, he claimed. \"Ragging as a practice has been cemented as part of the SCDF psyche, and is unlikely to go away anytime soon,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/scdf-ragging-rituals-from-being-dunked-in-pump-wells-to-blanket-10232774"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 11:00PM", "tags": ["animals"], "author": "", "title": "Dog flu hits animal establishments in Pasir Ris Farmway area", "content": " SINGAPORE: Cases of canine influenza have hit animal establishments in the Pasir Ris Farmway area, according to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). In a Facebook post on Monday (May 14), the authority said it received reports of \"kennel cough\" among dogs in the area and started investigating.  \"Samples collected from affected dogs have been found to be positive for canine influenza virus,\" said AVA. \"We are advising animal establishments within the area to seek veterinary treatment for their dogs, and practise good hygiene and biosecurity measures to limit the spread of the virus.\" Canine influenza - also known as dog flu - is a type of flu that infects dogs, leading to symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, fever, lethargy, eye discharge and reduced appetite. It is different from kennel cough, which is another type of respiratory infection in dogs. Not all dogs will show signs of illness, and the disease is typically not life-threatening, with most dogs recovering within two or three weeks, according to AVA. However, the illness can develop into something more serious. Puppies, elderly dogs and dogs with existing illnesses can subsequently develop pneumonia. Canine influenza is not known to infect humans. HOW IT SPREADS The canine influenza virus can spread via coughing or sneezing from infected dogs, said AVA.  It can also spread through objects contaminated by the \"respiratory secretions\" of an infected dog, such as food bowls, toys, bedding, collars and leashes that are shared between infected and uninfected dogs, added the authority. The risk of the disease is highest when large numbers of dogs are \"housed together in close confinement\", said AVA. ADVICE FOR DOG OWNERS Pet owners should seek veterinary attention if their dogs are unwell, said AVA. Owners should keep their unwell dog away from activities or facilities where other dogs are present, until it has fully recovered. Owners should also practise good hygiene to minimise the risk of spreading the illness.  This includes washing their hands with soap and water, before and after coming into contact with dogs and their immediate environment.

He added, however, that meritocracy is not a perfect system and does not work properly, especially when it is focused on outcome or engenders ruthless competition at the expense of cooperation. Over time, this can increase inequality and polarise society into the haves and have nots, he added.  \"At the root of it is this: It just gets harder for them to succeed, and eventually, it becomes almost impossible. Slowly and quietly, society will break up within,\" Mr Masagos said.  As such, he advocated for a Singapore brand of meritocracy - one that balances economic and social policies. \"We cannot drive our economic policies on fierce pursuit of economic gains, but neither can we design our social policies with bleeding hearts,\" he said.  THREE CHARACTERISTICS One characteristic of Singapore's meritocracy is for the successful to give back to society. The minister said: \"Meritocracy can only be moral when those who take the most from the system also put the most back into it.\" He said that those who are successful should realise how lucky they are and not forget the support society has given through a good education, a safe and secure environment and the mental and emotional support. Remember to give back, he exhorted.  \"In our meritocratic society, we must ensure that the spirit of giving back is most apparent in the successful,\" Mr Masagos said, highlighting the examples of the late Dr Ee Peng Liang and his son Gerard Ee, as well as Mr Mohamed Abdul Jaleel, among others.  He added that only when the successful give back will society accept, rather than envy, their successes.  \"Success that benefits others is success which we can all be grateful for,\" he explained.  The second characteristic of Singapore's meritocracy is the creation of essential common spaces and experiences for all, Mr Masagos said. \"No other country or city shares common spaces like Singapore. We live together in shared neighbourhoods, eat at the same hawker centres, exercise in the same parks and waterways, and bring our children to the same libraries to read. This is special,\" he said.  More than just spaces for the community to come together and interact, regardless of race, language or religion, these places guarantee common access to quality public services and infrastructure, the minister pointed out.  As the Government shares the country's urban landscape, it must distribute rental housing across the island and mix public and private housing more deliberately, so that the most needy among us - those \"who have not yet done well in our meritocracy\" - are not deprived of access to good quality public facilities, he said.  Mr Masagos added: \"The successful and yet-to-be successful will live equally far or near to new nodes of economic activity in Jurong and Punggol, to hawker centres, eldercare facilities and schools.\" Lastly, a feature of Singapore's meritocracy is how the Government supports this effort through its policies, which the minister described as \"ladders and bridges\" for people to move up in society.  \"The Government must therefore not allow meritocracy to reward narrowly, and instead broaden and make alternative routes available,\" he said.  These policies must also enable self-reliance by supporting and encouraging work, so that they can do well for themselves and their families regardless of where they are in  Singapore's system of meritocracy at that point of time.  He added that the Government is not stopping there, and already recognises that the country's workforce must be ready for future opportunities. \"We are investing in SkillsFuture to support the lifelong development of skills and knowledge, and Industry Transformation Maps to enable our workforce to seize opportunities in the future economy,\" the minister said.  \"This will also ensure that our meritocracy does not become a static snapshot, but a dynamic one where everyone has the opportunity to reap success throughout his life journey.\" It is, ultimately, trust between citizens and institutions that will strengthen the Singapore brand of meritocracy, Mr Masagos said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/spirit-of-giving-back-must-be-most-apparent-among-successful-10232514"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 06:57PM", "tags": ["financial institutions", "banks", "finance", "money", "1MDB"], "author": "Janice Lim", "title": "Regulators, banks to use data analytics to combat financial crime", "content": " SINGAPORE: In a bid to boost the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing schemes, banks here may soon be sharing a standard format of data submission and risk analytics with regulators and law enforcement agencies.  This follows recommendations released on Monday (May 14) by Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Industry Partnership (ACIP), a pact formed in April 2017 between the government and private companies in the financial industry as well as the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS). In a report, the partnership recommended that agencies such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) collaborate with financial institutions on data analytics. It is hoped that this will help them detect money-laundering activities, such as those seen in the 1MDB scandal that involved several banks in Singapore, and weed out terrorism financiers. Currently there is no standardised format for banks to submit their data, which makes it difficult for MAS to analyse it and detect suspicious patterns. Speaking at an industry dialogue, special advisor of MAS’ financial supervision group Chua Kim Leng said that the regulator has managed to identity suspicious transaction reports across banks using network analysis. “Data analytics has helped us better identify problem areas,” said Mr Chua. “This has made our inspections more focused and effective, and has yielded findings that would be more useful to the banks in enhancing their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems and implementation.” The partnership also recommended that a central register of owners of legal entities incorporated in Singapore be set up, so that banks will find it easier to identify owners who may not be directly connected to these legal entities. The release of the recommendations comes in the wake of the 1MDB scandal, which saw several banks in Singapore fined for money laundering activities. IDENTIFYING \"RED-FLAG\" BEHAVIOURS The papers highlighted some of the latest and established methods used to carry out financial crime, so that financial institutions can look out for such \"red-flag\" behaviours or transaction patterns to better detect illegal financial activities. One recurring method that authorities continue to find is the suspicious “round-tripping” of funds through companies controlled by the same or related individuals. One example, explained by Mr Chua, is how a network of several companies, which were incorporated in various countries, had all of its bank accounts in Singapore, controlled by the same person. Large sums of money were transferred from one company to another before being returned within a short period of time under the guise of \"repayment of loans\". A new and emerging method to carry out financial crime is the use of entities with names similar to established companies so that banks will believe that the entity in question is related to or is the equivalent to the legitimate company. CAD director David Chew, who was speaking as the same industry dialogue, said: “Criminals are constantly exploring new ways to exploit our financial system to launder their criminal proceeds and evade detection by law enforcement.” Mr Chew added that ABS and the Institute of Banking and Finance will include recommendations from both papers into their future training. CAD’s Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office will also update its guidelines on what constitutes “red-flag” behaviours as highlighted in the papers as a reference for all reporting entities.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/regulators-banks-to-use-data-analytics-to-combat-financial-crime-10231788"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 06:41PM", "tags": ["President's Address", "Parliament", "Housing", "Education", "Inequality"], "author": "Fann Sim", "title": "Social divide, inequality take centre stage in MPs' response to President's Address", "content": " SINGAPORE: Social divide and inequality in Singapore were a big focus among People's Action Party backbenchers as they debated the President’s Address in Parliament on Monday (May 14).  The MPs suggested several ideas to target inequality, which President Halimah Yacob last week said will be tackled during this term of Parliament. MP for Jurong GRC Ang Wei Neng said that despite assertions that every school is a good school, he is concerned that the range of students getting into the perceived “elite” schools in Singapore is narrowing in terms of family affluence. “The concern is that the rich, well-connected parents have the means to ‘protect access’ to the best schools, and perhaps even the best opportunities in life for their children, excluding those who are not so well-off,” he said.  He questioned if Singapore is meritocratic. “The concern is that the haves, with their connections and advantages, get more and more economic, social and cultural capital, while the have-nots struggle to even get a leg in the game even if they work hard from the start,” he said. The MPs suggested several ways of bridging the divide, through the education system and housing and social policies, for instance. MP for Nee Soon GRC Henry Kwek suggested that school leaders pay special attention to collaboration between elite and other schools, “to give students from different educational backgrounds a chance to forge friendship from a young age”. Joining his fellow MPs in emphasising the role of education in addressing divide and inequality was MP for Potong Pasir constituency Sitoh Yih Pin. He acknowledged that education, hard work, grit and determination have worked well for two to three generations of Singaporeans. Meritocracy works well if the gap between the haves and the have-nots is close, as was the case in the past decades, he said. “Now, income inequality is wider. The gap in resources available to families with higher income and those with lower income is stark,” he said. While this issue is being addressed in the preschool arena, he said that the issue of widening inequality in Singapore is \"decidedly more complex\" and requires greater attention. The importance of addressing the issue of widening inequality cannot be emphasised enough, he said, because deep within the city's social compact is a belief that as a community, regardless of race, language or religion, Singaporeans will always improve their lives together.   “Once any number of Singaporeans lose this belief, social stratification will occur and our social compact will be broken,” he cautioned. Mr Ang also suggested building passageways beside MRT stations that give access to both condominium residents and HDB residents a direct route to the stations, while Mr Kwek proposed financial literacy and better housing policies to help the needy. MAKING THE EDUCATION SYSTEM MORE INCLUSIVE, LESS ACADEMIC In line with inclusivity in schools, MP for Feng Shan ward Cheryl Chan suggested a “through train” programme to secondary school for special needs students in mainstream schools based on feedback from parents. Special needs students are not given exemptions and struggle even with taking an additional language or subject in mainstream schools, she said. “It may be a sweeping statement to say all special needs children in mainstream schools are late bloomers but I am certain no one will deny that these children deserve the opportunity to have a longer runway to learn and explore their potential at a pace that is suitable for them,” Ms Chan said. She also suggested that Values in Action (VIA) performance can be included as part of the school admission criteria. Nurturing citizens to embody the spirit of care and giving can start with young Singaporeans by blurring the lines of socioeconomic background through valuing their actions towards community and country, she added. “Our students can ace through exams but such achievements do not empower or make them a more purposeful individual. VIA is unlikely to sustain at the current rate unless it is given emphasis in mainstream school admission criterion and not limited to those under Direct School Admission,” she said. RETHINK POLICIES FOR OLD HDB FLATS Ms Chan also touched on the issue of HDB flats with ageing leases, and said that it is time to include other considerations and augment the Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) for such flats. She proposed that the valuation method for aged flats should be changed from the current method of past market transactions to an approach that includes valuation based on its remaining lease, length of time occupied by current owner and its right-sizing potential. This, she said, will enable the elderly to unlock cash, right-size and move nearer to their children. It will also enable young families or singles to afford resale flats in mature estates, and enhance the social mix. Ms Chan proposed for precincts in mature towns to be made available to private developers for lease top-ups, and for the authorities to re-assess the property loan structure and CPF-cash quantum usage when purchasing older flats. Old flats could also be rented out from HDB to those who do not qualify as low income but have needs for interim housing, such as families who are transiting, young adults with little need for permanent housing or single parents who need immediate shelter.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/parliament/social-divide-inequality-president-address-parliament-10232426"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 06:03PM", "tags": ["Workers' Party", "Pritam Singh"], "author": "Tang See Kit", "title": "Living costs deserve ‘closest scrutiny’; share information about Government spending: Pritam Singh", "content": " SINGAPORE: Describing living costs in Singapore as the issue that deserves the “closest scrutiny”, the Workers’ Party’s (WP) secretary-general Pritam Singh on Monday (May 14) called on the Government to share more information about its “current estimates and underlying basis” for higher expenditure projections.  While the need for increased spending in areas like healthcare “is not unexpected” given the country’s ageing population, this information “needs to be shared so that the public are clear-eyed about the sufficiency of the Budget at the Government’s disposal to help Singaporeans with the cost of living today,” he said in Parliament.  The Aljunied GRC Member of Parliament was the first opposition MP to speak since the opening of the second session of the 13th Parliament. This was also Mr Singh’s first parliamentary speech since taking over Mr Low Thia Khiang as WP chief last month. He devoted his speech to rising living costs in Singapore, noting that this is the issue that has dominated recent headlines and “deserves closest scrutiny for the remainder of the term and beyond”. Mr Singh raised several examples, ranging from last year’s announcement of a hike in water prices, the planned increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), possible rises in public transport fares to concerns faced by young couples when planning for a family. On the issue of likely increases in public transport fares on the back of a growing network capacity and ridership, Mr Singh noted that members of the public had questioned if the cost of running and improving the transport system should “just be seen through the eyes of fare revenue”. Citing calls made to a local radio station, he said: “Many questioned if there ought to be some scope for other segments of SMRT’s business to subsidise train operations too, such as advertising and revenue from other investments, to lessen the effect of any fare increases on the general population.” To that, Mr Singh added: “The question of the quantum of surpluses and prospect of alternate revenue streams in future surpluses of many government-linked companies and statutory boards to better cushion price hikes on Singaporeans needs to be looked at very closely and debated before prices go up.\"  In another example centred on the water price hike, Mr Singh asked how “future capital investments in water supply and transmission cohere with the large capital reserves” of PUB, Singapore’s national water agency. He added that PUB’s reserves have “increased consistently from around S$3 billion in 2007 to more than S$5 billion in 2016”.  “Getting into the details of such matters will represent the unique partnership with the people,” he said, adding that it will represent “bold leadership”.  “Such an approach will also come with an upshot. Price hikes are likely to be better understood and contextualised to the benefit of the policy discourse in Singapore,” he added.  Mr Singh also said that while Singapore's fourth-generation leadership is coming into power when expenditure will rise in concert with the changing demographics of Singapore, \"that is only half the story\". Mr Singh said the inclusion of Temasek Holdings into the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) from 2016 has “also put more money, and by extension more political capital, in the hands of the current Government and 4G leaders than any generation of PAP leaders”.  “This is without having even to call on the President to unlock the reserves,” he added. He cited how the overall Budget surplus for this term of Government for both FY2016 and FY2017, after taking into account transfers to endowments and trust funds, stands at S$15.7 billion.  “(This) could potentially cover two more Pioneer Generation packages of about S$8 billion dollars each, covering almost an additional one million more elderly and this is only taking into account the accumulated surplus out of two of the five years of this Government’s term.”  The “first and only draw-down” of the reserves in 2009 requiring Presidential approval amounted to just S$4.9 billion, he added.  “With S$15.7 billion in hand today, and given the putatively stable formula for NIRC withdrawals in spite of market fluctuations, the picture for the immediate future does not appear to be one of a Government needing money to stay afloat or needing to tax the population and as a result, raising the cost of living,” said Mr Singh.  “We are told more money is needed for healthcare and other areas in years to come. This is not unexpected given our demographic transition … but what are the Government’s current estimates and the underlying basis for its projections of higher expenditure coming on stream in the future?  “This information needs to be shared so that the public are clear-eyed about the sufficiency of the budget at the Government’s disposal to help Singaporeans with the cost of living today,” he emphasised.  GOVERNMENT SHOULD INVEST ENERGY TO ENGAGE, EXPLAIN: PRITAM SINGH Referring to President Halimah Yacob’s address, Mr Singh noted that remarks referring to how the 4G leaders cannot take the people’s trust for granted, the need to resist temptation to avoid bold changes, and how the 4G leadership must fire up and mobilise the spirit of young Singaporeans “shone through” in particular.  But “one threat that binds these three directives is the ability and willingness to listen to the people”, he said.  Societal norms and political expectations of political leadership have evolved, Mr Singh added. He said that alternative views “will have to be addressed, and accommodated and considered thoughtfully”.  As such, the Government should not “close the door or resign itself to the politics of majoritarianism when a sensitive or difficult subject comes along”.  Instead, it should “invest a lot more energy to engage and explain”, said the opposition chief.  “If the approach of the 4G leaders is to ignore, silence or ridicule alternative ideas, they will fail to galvanise and spur all Singaporeans to greater heights. Or worse, they may even engender a divided society, rendering the message of inclusivity hollow and without substance,” he said.  “This would be an untenable outcome for the continued success of a small country like Singapore that needs to pursue innovation and excellence, and to conceive new ways of doing things with greater vigour than ever before.”  Lastly in his speech, Mr Singh acknowledged Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing’s tribute to Mr Low.  “The Workers' Party will always bear in mind the national interests in our deliberations and endeavour in the interest of Singaporeans and Singapore,” said Mr Singh.  MAKE CONVERSATIONAL MALAY PART OF PRIMARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM: CHEN SHOW MAO  Meanwhile, fellow Aljunied GRC MP Chen Show Mao said an increased focus in teaching the Malay language in local schools could help the Government attain the five priorities laid out in the President’s address.  He suggested making conversational Malay classes part of the local primary school syllabus to help all young Singaporeans to attain some basic level of proficiency and fluency in the language.  However, he stressed that this should be done without giving students the additional pressure of exams.  Being Singapore’s national language and a regional language, learning Bahasa Melayu will “protect and preserve (Singapore’s) multi-culturalism and promote national integration”, said Mr Chen. It is “also important to securing (Singapore’s) future in the region and sharing of the growth of the region,” he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/living-costs-deserve-closest-scrutiny-share-information-about-10231794"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 05:53PM", "tags": ["Barcelona", "Baku", "Silverstone", "Miami"], "author": "", "title": "F1 considered Silverstone switch for 1,000th race", "content": " BARCELONA: Formula One bosses considered moving next year's British Grand Prix back to April so that Silverstone could host the 1,000th championship race but that honour will go to China instead, according to the sport's managing director Sean Bratches. Bratches told Reuters at last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix that the British weather had made such a rescheduling impractical. Silverstone, which hosted the first Formula One championship race in 1950, will put on this year's British race on Jul 8. \"Silverstone was the first grand prix and we would have liked to see the 1,000th go back to the first,\" said Bratches. \"I think there's a nice story and a nice harmony there. \"But when I was told, being a relatively new Brit, that the weather is sub-optimal in April, they warded me off that quickly.\" The American, who joined Formula One last year when US-owned Liberty Media took over as the commercial rights holder, confirmed China - which will be the third race on the 2019 calendar - would host the 1,000th. The 2019 schedule has yet to be published and there has been some speculation about whether Liberty might tweak it to ensure a circuit with more atmosphere and history hosted the milestone race. Silverstone has hosted a British Grand Prix in April before, in 2000 when it rained heavily and the car parks turned into fields of mud. The main car parks were then closed to all except coaches, forcing many spectators to trudge over fields to watch the action. Bratches said Formula One planned to make a big deal of the 1,000th race throughout 2019, with China a key market for the sport's growth. \"We've spent a lot of time on this topic and looking at different circumstances, weather patterns,\" he said of the schedule. \"China is a great place to race. It's part of our future and we're excited about going there for that particular race. \"That said ... next year we're going to celebrate it as the year of the 1,000th grand prix so you're going to see integrations across the year celebrating this incredible milestone,\" he added. RISK-FREE Bratches said the Chinese organisers had welcomed the move. \"They're embracing it and we're starting to have discussions in terms of how we can amplify it and make sure that it's celebrated in an appropriate way,\" he said. Formula One has a record-equalling 21 races this season and Miami could be joining the party in 2019 with a street race proposed. That has led to paddock speculation about Azerbaijan's future but Bratches said that race was not linked in any way to Miami. \"Nonsense. Capital letters. There's no relationship between our efforts and grand prix in Baku and any other grand prix in the world,\" he said. \"Fake news.\" Silverstone's future has also been in the spotlight after the circuit's owners activated a break clause in 2017 which means next year's race will be the last unless a new deal is done. Representatives from Silverstone were in Barcelona but Bratches said there had been no meeting. \"We didn't have conversations with them this particular weekend. Most of the discussions we've been having have been taking place in London and that's not to insinuate that anything is wrong,\" he said. \"There's a lot of promoters here from Singapore, Silverstone and around Europe and the globe. Hockenheim is here,\" he added, referring to the German track whose deal expires this year. Hockenheim promoters said last week that they wanted to continue but with a new 'risk-free' deal, a concept that has met with little favour in the past and may again fall on barren ground. \"A lot of people might want a risk-free contract but that's not our business model. We're looking forward to the grand prix there this year,\" said Bratches.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/f1-considered-silverstone-switch-for-1-000th-race-10232416"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 05:32PM", "tags": ["crime", "molest", "outrage of modesty"], "author": "Lianne Chia", "title": "Six years’ jail, caning for man who molested girlfriend’s daughters while they were sleeping", "content": " SINGAPORE: A man who molested his girlfriend’s young daughters while they were sleeping was sentenced on Monday (May 14) to six years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The 29-year-old Malaysian man, who cannot be named due to a gag order, had earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of outraging the modesty of a person under the age of 14. Four other similar charges were also taken into consideration during his sentencing. According to court documents, the man got to know the victims, now aged eight and 13, in 2014, when he got into a relationship with their mother. While the two victims share the same mother, they have different biological fathers. Shortly after, their mother conceived and gave birth to the man’s daughter some time in 2015.   He moved in with the family last year. The entire family, except for the victims’ grandfather, would sleep on mattresses in the flat’s living room. The victims treated the man as a step-father even though he was not married to their mother, added Deputy Public Prosecutor Michael Quilindo. Documents showed that on one occasion, the man had touched and rubbed the eight-year-old girl’s private parts while she was sleeping, only stopping when the girl began to stir in her sleep. He was found out when the victim’s child protection officer made a police report on 19 May, 2017. In the course of investigations, it was revealed that the man had also touched the girl’s half-sister in a similar fashion on at least six occasions. These instances occurred on different nights. DPP Quilindo said that during investigations, the man had admitted that he would only touch the victims sexually when it was dark at night and everyone was sleeping. When asked why he had done so, he said: “It was an urge ... I can’t control my sexual urge”. Citing an Institute of Mental Health report, DPP Quilindo also pointed out that the accused had paedophilic tendencies which appear to have remained dormant until the offences occurred. These tendencies, however, “seem to have been unmasked in the presence of close physical proximity with pre-pubertal girls”. Although the man claimed that the offending behaviour was opportunistic in nature, and blamed the victims’ mother for forcing him to sleep next to the victims, it would appear that he made “no attempt to remove himself from the situation, nor insist that the girls do not sleep next to him”, he added. For each count of outraging the modesty of a victim below the age of 14, the man could have been jailed for up to five years, with a fine or caning.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/six-years-jail-caning-for-man-who-molested-girlfriend-s-10232304"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 05:32PM", "tags": ["malay-muslims", "terrorism", "religious extremism", "masagos zulkifli"], "author": "", "title": "Malay-Muslim community must tackle 3 ‘elements’ to ensure continued progress, says Masagos Zulkifli", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Malay-Muslim community in Singapore has seen the fruits of its meritocratic system, but it cannot rest on its laurels. In order to continue progress, it has to tackle three external elements, said Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli. Speaking during the debate on the President’s Address on Monday (May 14), Mr Masagos pointed out that after 50 years of independence, the country’s Malay-Muslim community is one that “no longer resign ourselves to fate only”. In terms of education, only 1 per cent of its children do not complete 10 years of schooling, Mr Masagos said, while 94 per cent have a post-secondary education. The percentage of professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) from the community has also increased from slightly more than 7 per cent in 1980 to more than 32 per cent in 2015, he added. But he cautioned the community against resting on their laurels. “This is because there are three external elements that we must tackle. Failing to do so will hinder our community’s progress in the future,” Mr Masagos said. He is also minister for the Environment and Water Resources. LOCAL RELIGIOUS TEACHERS MUST BE AS GOOD AS FOREIGN ONES One of these challenges is how external elements have changed and influenced the way some in the community lead their religious life here and, to some extent, succeeded in eroding the cultural values of Malay-Muslims in the region, the minister said. These external elements can also divide the community and even among family members, he added. Thus, the role of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) in supporting local Muslims in their socio-religious life and their interaction with the country’s multiracial community is “very important”, the minister said. “We will continue to strive to ensure that local religious teachers are on par and as good as foreign religious educators who may be seen as more glamorous. This is because the religious messages must not only be attractive, but more importantly effective and relevant to life in Singapore,” Mr Masagos said. The Asatizah Recognition Scheme must thus continue to be improved with guidance from the Office of the Mufti and support from religious teachers, as the scheme will authorise these teachers to spread Islamic teachings in line with the way of life and context in Singapore, without compromising the basic tenets of Islam, he explained. The second element to be tackled is the distinct shift in the economy, Mr Masagos pointed out. The country’s strong position is being challenged and countries in the region have become “fierce competitors”, and new technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics will be disruptive forces. These contribute to making jobs obsolete and yesterday’s skills irrelevant for the future, he said. Mendaki, thus, can make play an important role to mitigate such effects. For one, it will continue to ensure students have basic education and empower those who have potential – from as early as pre-school age, the minister said. It is working with Government agencies and other Malay-Muslim organisations to focus on addressing factors that may hinder children’s education, particularly when there are troubled families, he added. “This is because children from troubled families are not only unable to realise their full potential, but also face the risk of falling into the pitfalls of crimes and drug abuse,” Mr Masagos elaborated. FIGHTING RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM WITH INTERACTION The third external element is foreign religious extremism and the influence this may have, the minister said. Religious extremism is not limited to terrorism as such attitudes encourage one to be exclusive, which can cause the Muslim community to isolate itself from other communities, said Mr Masagos, adding that it has “already hindered the integration between different communities” to some extent. The People’s Association (PA) Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) thus plays an important role in making sure the community have opportunities to interact with other communities – whether in schools, offices and beyond, he said. “This is how Singapore develops a friendly and harmonious society because there is great interaction between one another regardless of race, religion and culture,” Mr Masagos said. “At the same time, we are sensitive to our equal rights and responsibilities as citizens. This is what makes our society united.” To further empower MESRA, the minister said Malay grassroots volunteers should work towards building wider and deeper relationships within the Malay community, he said. One of the ways it is doing so is through the programmes started by MESRA advisers like Associate Professor Faishal Ibrahim, Mr Amrin Amin and Ms Rahayu Mahzam involving professionals in sectors like law, health and education. These programmes will be widened and brought to more estates as well as the MESRA Centre at Wisma Geylang Serai, the minister announced. Another initiative is to strengthen the leadership within MESRA, and Mr Masagos announced the setting up of the MESRA Advisory Council which comprises seven advisors, MESRA’s top exco members and the professionals. “This is the greatest product of meritocracy in our Malay-Muslim community, in which our outstanding professionals who have achieved success, return to serve the community,” Mr Masagos said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/malay-muslim-community-tackle-3-elements-progress-masagos-10232318"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 05:08PM", "tags": [], "author": "", "title": "Singapore Tourism Board chief Lionel Yeo to step down end May", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore Tourism Board (STB) Chief Executive Lionel Yeo will step down on May 31 to join the private sector after 22 years of public service, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Monday (May 14). “On behalf of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, I would like to express my appreciation to Lionel for his significant contributions to STB and the tourism sector over the last six years,” said MTI Permanent Secretary Loh Khum Yean. “Under Lionel’s leadership, STB has worked closely with the tourism sector to strengthen our value proposition and product offerings which has helped Singapore achieve consistently strong tourism performance.

The man, who cannot be named due to a court order, pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated sexual assault by penetration. Nine other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that the victim’s father had hired the man as a delivery driver for a restaurant owned by the victim’s grandfather almost 10 years before the man began committing the offences. The man was regarded as a long-time employee and “more than a worker”, said Deputy Public Prosecutors David Khoo and N K Anitha. The man also cared for the victim and her younger sisters like his own daughters, and would buy toys and sweets for them, they added. The victim, who is now nine years old, also shared a close relationship with the man, whom she affectionately called “Uncle”. When the victim’s father and grandfather had a falling-out, the man also acted as the “trusted link” between the estranged families, bringing food and household items to the victim’s home. He also visited the victim on his own accord during his free time. But investigations revealed that when no one was watching, the man would make the victim sit on his lap, before sexually assaulting her in the rest area of the office of her family’s restaurant. The man also kissed and licked the victim’s genitals on several occasions, exposed himself to her and invited her to touch his genitals, which she did. The man also showed the victim a pornographic video on his phone on one occasion. These offences, which began in 2015 when the victim was in Primary 1, went on for nearly 15 months, according to court documents. The man continued his offences even while visiting the victim at her home. The man was discovered in December 2016, when, on one occasion, the victim’s domestic helper saw his hand inside the victim’s tights. She had also heard the victim tell the man, “Uncle, stop it”. After the man left the house, the domestic helper asked the victim what had happened. The victim started to cry and told her what the man had done. The victim and her family members filed a police report soon after. MAN ABUSED TRUST OF VICTIM’S FAMILY Prosecutors called for a sentence of 28 years’ jail for the man, pointing out that the man had abused a young child’s affection towards him, as well as her family’s trust, to “satisfy his lustful desires”. “Given the nature and frequency of the offences he committed against the very young victim, it is unimaginable what fate could have befallen her had the offences not been discovered,” they said. In mitigation, defence lawyer Wee Hong Shern said that such a term would be “crushing” and “excessive”, explaining that the man had never, on any occasion, used violence in order to commit the offences. He added that the man had also been very careful not to cause the victim physical pain, and is “truly remorseful” for his wrongdoing. In asking the judge for leniency, Mr Wee pointed out that the man was “very lonely and miserable” before committing the offences, and has not slept on the same bed with his wife for more than 20 years. A jail term of 20 years, he said, would serve as “sufficient deterrence”. In sentencing the man, Justice Woo Bih Li noted that there was an element of trust by the man’s employer. Although the man’s relationship with the victim’s family was not the same as that of a family relationship or one between a teacher and student, the man, nonetheless, had betrayed the trust of his employer, he said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jailed-20-years-for-sexually-assaulting-employer-s-young-10232052"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 04:11PM", "tags": ["food hygiene"], "author": "", "title": "Aloha Poke apologises for spider found in raw fish salad, closes Katong kitchen for 2 days", "content": " SINGAPORE: Aloha Poke has apologised for an incident in which a customer purportedly found a dead spider at the bottom of her poke bowl, and also closed its kitchen in Katong for two days for a \"comprehensive investigation and cleaning\". Facebook user Siew Ping wrote in a post last Thursday night (May 10) that she had ordered a Nalu Salmon poke bowl from the raw fish bar via food delivery service Deliveroo. The dish comprises two scoops of marinated raw salmon on a rice and salad base.  Ms Siew said that she and her friend were \"happily working (their) way through the bowl\" when, to their horror, they found a dead spider, \"limp and soaked with sauce\", at the bottom of the dish.  \"Perhaps spiders are not as bad as rats or roaches, however as Aloha Poke is handling raw food and that is susceptible to bacteria growth and contamination, their hygiene standards cannot be compromised at any time. Having a spider in the midst of their kitchen does say a lot about their vigilance,\" she wrote.  In an official statement on Monday, the homegrown restaurant chain said that as soon as it became aware of the situation on Friday morning, it reached out to Ms Siew and her husband \"to take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly\".  Ms Siew wrote in an update to her post on Saturday that she had received a full refund for the meal as well as S$20 in credit.  In addition to this, Aloha Poke wrote that it had advised Ms Siew's husband to update the company should any of those who consumed the food fall ill over the next few days. \"Since then we focused our attention on conducting a thorough investigation and started taking further precautions to prevent such a re-occurrence,\" Aloha Poke said in the statement.  Co-founder John Chen told Channel NewsAsia that the restaurant had reached out again to Ms Siew and her husband on Monday morning to update them on the investigations.  \"We apologise unreservedly for the oversight, but we are confident that it was an isolated incident and has never happened before in any of our outlets. We will continue to improve our processes to ensure such an incident will never reoccur, and to uphold the quality standards expected of Aloha Poke,\" Mr Chen said.  Ms Siew, in a further update to her post on Monday, noted that her husband had spoken to Mr Chen and been updated about the investigations and assured that the restaurant's team and business partners would \"do the right thing\". According to the restaurant, the bowl in question was delivered from its Editions kitchen in Katong, which is rated “A\" for cleanliness by the National Environment Agency (NEA). The kitchen most recently underwent a routine monthly pest control check on May 2, Aloha Poke said.  \"Nevertheless, after discussions with and obtaining agreement from Deliveroo, we decided to voluntarily close the Katong kitchen for two days for a comprehensive investigation and cleaning. No Aloha Poke outlets will be impacted by this, and the Katong kitchen will resume operations on Wednesday.\"  \"OUR EXISTING MEASURES WERE NOT FAIL-SAFE\" Aloha Poke said in its statement that it had also discussed the situation \"at length\" with its key salad supplier, a \"highly reputable homegrown company known for its quality products\".  \"Our produce is grown on open fields and even with the controlled use of pesticides, garden insects and pests are inevitable,\" the restaurant chain said.  It added that the salad supplier has tight procedures, which it is \"continuously improving\", to promote insect monitoring and removal.  \"At Aloha Poke, besides paying a premium to purchase our mesclun salad pre-washed, we take an extra step to ensure that all our salad is washed for the second time and thoroughly checked prior to serving. \"Unfortunately, our existing measures were not fail-safe. We cannot apologise enough for what happened with Siew Ping, but we believe that this was an isolated incident and has never occurred previously at any of our outlets.\" The salad supplier, according to Ms Siew's post, happened to be her friend's partner. \"He called me soon after seeing my original post and was profusely and sincerely apologetic. He cannot speak for Aloha Poke but he took time to explain that, yes, food safety is of utmost importance and that food safety inspections are conducted by his team before onward distribution.\" Ms Siew said that as a consumer, she would hold Aloha Poke, as the \"F&B point-of-sale\", accountable. \"They are customer facing, the ones whom I'm paying for my food, and earning my trust. Let me eat my poke bowl and you go hash out the food safety details and workflow with your associates and business partners.\" However, she conceded that it was most likely an isolated incident. \"We are humans who make unintentional mistakes. But since Not-So-Small Spidey found a hole in the system and made his/her way into my food, I think it warrants some attention.\" Ms Siew said in her post last Thursday that she would submit a report to NEA as the restaurant had told her it was \"inappropriate\" for them to submit a report to the authority.  Channel NewsAsia has reached out to NEA for comment. Ms Siew noted on Tuesday that Aloha Poke and its business partners have \"stepped up to take concrete corrective actions\" after her post went viral. She said that the companies involved have voluntarily scheduled independent third party audits and will also invite NEA to perform inspections at its discretion.  \"This to me is a comprehensive response that acknowledges the unintended consequence and will help Aloha Poke and its business partners win back the trust of its customers,\" Ms Siew told Channel NewsAsia.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/aloha-poke-apologises-for-spider-found-in-raw-fish-salad-closes-10231604"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 04:11PM", "tags": ["chan chun sing", "diplomacy", "foreign relations"], "author": "", "title": "As a small state, Singapore must remain neutral and principled: Chan Chun Sing ", "content": " SINGAPORE: Singapore, as a small state, must continue to be principled and neutral in its dealings with other countries as it looks to remain relevant to the outside world, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Monday (May 14). Mr Chan, in his speech during the debate on the President’s address, pointed out that the relative shift of economic weight between the West and the East, as epitomised by the US and China, will define the global security and economic environment in the years to come. As many ask which side should Singapore be on, the minister cautioned that that is not the right way to frame the issue. “As a small country with an open economy, we believe in a rule-based, connected and interdependent world,” he said. “Our task is not in choosing sides.” Small states, more than others, must be principled, Mr Chan went on. “If others attach a price to our stand and position, no one will take us seriously ever again.” He pointed out that Singapore played host to historic meetings between China and Taiwan, such as the Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, and will also play host to the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. “Our principled stand and neutrality were some reasons why Singapore was chosen for these meetings,” the minister said. NAVIGATING CHINA, USA He also called on everyone – government, business and individuals – to understand the world and collectively remain alert to the forces impacting Singapore and to navigate them carefully. He cited the example of China, saying that the country, as a fast-evolving giant, is “not monolithic”. The country’s interests vary and differ across its security, economic and social dimensions and there are also different provinces and layers of government, each with their own perspectives and priorities. These, he said, tells of two things: Firstly, to be relevant to China, there cannot be a reliance on old mindsets and solutions as it is not looking for “hand-me-down solutions”. Rather, it is looking to develop its own solutions to its unique challenges, sometimes internally and other times with partners, he said. Secondly, knowing only China’s central government “will be necessary but not sufficient” given the different interests and perspectives. “Now that China has moved beyond attracting foreign investments to venturing abroad, we must ask ourselves how we can play a role in partnership with the Chinese to explore third country markets,” Mr Chan said. As for the US, he said that Singapore not only deepens collaboration through areas like smart city solutions and e-commerce, it is also looking to be a launchpad for American companies looking to grow in the region. “What’s clear is that no one deals with Singapore for our domestic markets or resources alone,” Mr Chan said. “Instead, they leverage upon us as a platform to reach the region and the world.” NETWORK, NETWORK, NETWORK In order for Singapore to remain relevant and attractive, Mr Chan pointed out, there is a need to develop people with a deep understanding of the region and the world so we can create value when others do business with us. The education system and training models must, therefore, evolve in tandem to support this, he added. Citing Singapore Management University (SMU) as an example, the minister said students who join the varsity from August this year will need to participate in at least one overseas programme before they can graduate. He also called on other institutions follow in their footsteps of giving students a strong competitive edge. The Trade and Industry Minister also shared that the Economic Development Board and associated agencies will collaborate to better organise and expand their reach overseas, and one initiative is to build a Singapore talent network to engage Singaporean families, friends and fans to be part of the Singapore Story. He also called for Singaporeans to be able to work with talented people from elsewhere locally, saying the dynamism of foreign professionals with the skilled local workforce will “bring out the best in each other”. Looking beyond our shores, Mr Chan said there is a need to better connect to the world as Singapore’s hinterland and gain access to resources and markets. This means widening the portfolio of markets to diversify the risks, as well as going beyond the conventional dimensions of air, land and sea connectivity to areas like data, finance, talent and technology. He added that as global production and supply chains shift, Singapore must stay agile to connect to these changes. PSA was held up as such an example, with Mr Chan saying that rather than competing with other global ports in size, it updated its strategy to become a global port and supply chain operator and compete at the system and network level instead. He likened PSA’s function to having an Intel chip inside the global trade flow operations. Ultimately, as Singapore’s economy matures and to achieve sustained economic growth, there is a need to venture out. This is not just about giving Singaporeans the best opportunities here in Singapore, but also helping them to seize the opportunities beyond our shores, the minister said.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-state-singapore-remain-neutral-principled-chan-chun-sing-10231998"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 04:04PM", "tags": ["Trending", "Heritage"], "author": "Mayo Martin", "title": "My childhood Chinatown: How I lived with prostitutes, gangs, corpses", "content": " Follow our new CNA LIFESTYLE page on Facebook for more trending stories and videos SINGAPORE: These days, Chinatown has become synonymous with two things: Hordes of tourists who soak in the sights at Temple and Pagoda Streets, or bar-hoppers on their way to that hip, new F&B outlet. But for three Singaporeans who grew up there decades ago, Chinatown was way more than a tourist trap or a nightlife destination. It was a dirty, dodgy and sometimes even dangerous place to live in. But theirs was a childhood to remember. Here are their stories.  YIP YEW CHONG: ‘THE CORPSE WAS SITTING UP!’ It’s one of the most macabre childhoods one could ever have: From the moment he was born until he was teenager, Yip Yew Chong spent his time around dead people. The 49-year-old accountant-artist, who’s known for his Instagram-friendly nostalgic murals in places such as Tiong Bahru and Kampong Glam, lived with his family at the infamous Sago Lane, also known as the Street of the Dead. Today, it is nothing more than a busy carpark right beside the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, and just across the road from Maxwell Food Centre and a short walking distance from the busy nightlife area of Erskine Road and Ann Siang Hill. But during the 1970s and 1980s, his family lived on the second floor of a shophouse smack in the middle of action. “In the day, there were funerals, and at night, there would be wakes. When I went downstairs, I’d have to walk past funeral parlours and the corpses would be on wooden planks. After a few days, they’d wash the corpses out in the open before putting them inside coffins. Nothing in those days was sanitary but you get used to it!” recalled Yip, with a laugh. His family was literally surrounded by things related to death. The store below them sold paper effigies and nearby were a couple of funeral parlours. Opposite the street (where the temple now stands) were shops that made mourning clothes and coffins. From his second-floor vantage point, Yip had a bird’s eye view of everything. “It became very interesting at night. There would be rows of tables out on the streets during the wakes and at 10pm, the rituals would start. A priest would spit kerosene into a small bonfire, which would result in a fireball directly underneath our house – every other night,” Yip said, adding that he had to put up with the noise, too. “I remember studying for PSLE and it would be tung-tung-chang-tung-tung-chang all day and night!” During the day, the street was just as lively as huge, colourful paper effigies would be displayed along the street, and trishaws bearing tourists would often stop by to take pictures. As a young boy, Yip also heard of some unusual stories. “Once, there was an ambulance that came (to deliver a corpse) and when the door was opened, there was a commotion because the corpse was sitting up!” he laughed. “Maybe the muscles had contracted or something but people were talking about it for weeks.” Another incident involved the police dropping by during the last few days of a wake. The corpse had already been in the coffin for a week and the police, who was investigating an incident, demanded it be opened. “By the time you put a body inside a coffin, it already smells – and when they opened it, wah, the whole street stank!” In 1983, a 14-year-old Yip and his family had to move as the shophouses was slated for demolition as part of the government’s plan to clean up the Singapore River – and Chinatown was identified as one of the main sources of all the rubbish. Together with the other residents and hawkers along Sago Lane, they moved to nearby Chinatown Complex. “But the strange thing was, after the street was demolished, the place was a grass patch for many years and we could see it from our new home,” said Yip, adding that the empty land would become the site of operas and temporary market stalls. Ironically, when his father died in 2009, the family set up the wake on that very same patch where Sago Lane once stood. Despite having created murals of old Singapore all around the city (including a recent one at Chinatown Complex), Yip hasn’t done anything related to Sago Lane due to the taboo surrounding death.  But he hasn’t forgotten it. One of his very first murals included an image of an amah (a domestic helper/nanny), the same woman who had lived with his family as a fellow boarder on 9A Sago Lane. VICTOR YUE: ‘MY UNCLE WAS ONCE BEATEN UP’ If you thought your childhood was tough, try telling that to Victor Yue, who grew up in Chinatown with no proper toilets, and always having to keep an eye out for gangsters. “A lot of the streets were gangster-infested. Different gangs had different turfs and when you’re around 10 years old, you have to be careful not to step into another’s turf, you know?” said the 65-year-old retired engineer and heritage enthusiast. His elders would also warn him to be alert when passing by coffeeshops. “In those days, they’d say you better be careful – when cups get overturned, you run for your life. It’s a sign of a fight!” Yue has lived in different parts of Chinatown all his life and spent his first 10 years at 29 Craig Road. Today, the row of shophouses where he lived has made way for Craig Place condominium, where foodies drop by today for the Spanish tapas twin restaurants Binomio and El Tardeo. But Yue's vivid memories of the area as a kid during the 1950s and 1960s was different. His family rented a room on the upper floor of a Peranakan woman's shophouse – which proved tricky considering the row of houses on the street had no sewage system and relied on nightsoil carriers. “It stank and sometimes, if you go and s**t at the wrong time, you can find that the bucket has disappeared because the guy came to change it,” said Yue. “And since we were on the second floor, you always prayed that when the guy walked up the flight of stairs, he didn’t spill!” Nevertheless, Craig Road had enough to entertain inquisitive youngsters like Yue, who would wander around the area up to Duxton Road, which today is packed with bars and restaurants. Back then, there was a small temple on the second floor of one of the shophouses, which was popular among residents. (Further up on Duxton Hill, where you've now got L’Entrecote The Steak & Fries Bistro and Lucha Loco, was no man's land for kids like Yue, who wouldn't dare enter another gang's turf.) Yue's immediate vicinity was equally interesting. He recalled that at the corner of Craig Road and Neil Road was a Tiger Balm factory, while opposite it was an old building where Chinatown Plaza now stands. “There were jambu and mango trees outside and we kids used to wait for the fruits to drop,” he said. There were also a couple of interesting shops along the road, selling wooden swords for wushu practitioners and a rental stall for old Chinese comics. At one corner, the results of chap ji ki – an old illegal lottery – would also be written out and sometimes his grandmother would ask him to check out the results. Incidentally, there were also two spirit mediums along the street – including an old lady who lived in a shophouse just beside where Pasta Brava now stands. “She’d be cooking and someone would come for consultation. She’d stop cooking, go into a trance, give you advice, then go back to cooking. She was a spirit medium on-demand,” he quipped. The street’s colourful character was also literally found on the pavement and walls – Craig Road was in the late Lee Kuan Yew’s Tanjong Pagar constituency. But Yue remembers there used to be an office of the opposition group Barisan Sosialis somewhere. For a child, these were all adult stuff – but one thing he had to really be alert about were gangsters. Yue would remember sneaking to the nearby Yan Kit Swimming Complex for a dip – but he knew he was taking risks. “A young boy might come up to challenge you by asking: ‘What number do you play?’ which referred to gang numbers,” he said. “If you quoted the wrong one, you'd be in trouble. If you thought you could bully him, you’d better watch out because behind him, there might be a bigger guy watching.” Luckily, Yue never had any personal encounters by making sure he didn’t stray far from home (gangs never harmed those who lived in in their turf, he pointed out). But there was one incident when he was very young that proved too close for comfort. “My uncle was once beaten up through mistaken identity. We had to seek help from the elders to find out, and later the gang apologised. In those days, the gangsters or secret societies had a code of conduct, so apologies were very ritualistic. They had to give you candles and things to pray to your ancestors and gods as a form of a very formal apology.” CHARMAINE LEUNG: ‘SOME MIGHT SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF FLESH’  Her mother ran a brothel. Her nanny was an alcoholic. And she once lived in fear of her friends discovering her home was in a red light district. Charmaine Leung’s childhood story is a Channel 8 drama waiting to happen. At the moment, though, you can already read all about it in her memoir titled 17A Keong Saik Road. The 45-year-old author’s moving story about growing up in the area during the 1970s was published last year. The title’s address refers to her mother’s brothel, while Leung herself lived on the second floor of the shophouse next door 15A with her nanny. Today, 17A is a hip bar and restaurant called Sluviche, while 15A is the office of German radio and television outfit ARD. But some places have remained the same. Next door is the Cundhi Gong Temple, where Leung and her mother would often sit down to watch their unusual world go by. Just opposite the road is a brothel that still operates today, marked by a light box with the number 8. “We’d sit around 6pm or 7pm and our view would be the ladies from that place who would come out and burn incense for good business,” she recalled. As a young child, she would often see them as they walked to and from the brothels. “They'd wear nice dresses in pretty hot weather,” said Leung. “And they weren’t what ordinary people would wear.\" \"Some might show a little bit of flesh. But the dresses seemed more like what people would wear when going onstage to perform, or what a nice dress would be in the 1970s and 1980s but exaggerated. Their skirts would have a bit of the can-can feel but shorter.” Back then, her mother’s brothel was just one of the many along Keong Saik Road and nearby streets. “At any one time, you can get up to 40 to 50 of these. Every few houses, you’d see the white box with the red words and numbers. \"19\" was one of the bigger ones with quite a lot of pretty, younger ladies,” she said, adding that prostitutes would start coming in at around mid-afternoon and the whole area would be the busiest between 8pm and 10pm. Of course, at that age, she was more or less oblivious to everything. “Overall, it never felt too dodgy because there were no transactions on the streets. But my perspective is really that of a child,” she said. But life in Keong Saik Road wasn’t just all about the brothels. Leung remembers loving the feeling of the street in the mornings. “There was almost no life compared to at night when it was a lot buzzier. There was a sense of serenity. Outsiders didn’t really dare to come in, so it almost felt like a city waking up,” she said. Leung also remembers playing along the back alleys and visiting her neighbours at nearby Jiak Chuan and Teck Lim Roads. Most of them are gone now, replaced by hip F&B places, but Leung remembers them vividly: Lime House and Harry’s Bar used to house a refrigerator repair store and a paper box shop, respectively. The back half of Spanish bar Esquina, she pointed out, was where her favourite ice cream uncle used to be. “It was just home-made ice cream with flavours like red bean, durian, corn and attap chee, which was my favourite,” she said. Gentrification has undoubtedly changed the face of Keong Saik Road, and Leung has mixed thoughts about it. While she welcomes the preservation of architecture and how some businesses embrace the place’s history (Keong Saik Bakery has done buns inspired by the shophouse’s previous majie owner), she bemoans the absence of actual residents who can form a community. “It has become a place where people visit, consume and walk away. And sometimes, I feel everything’s a bit too bright – the place used to look more lived in,” she said. Since coming back from Hong Kong, where she had been based, Leung has been active in promoting the area’s heritage. Aside from the occasional tours, she was also involved in the Chinatown segment of the recent Singapore Heritage Festival. She’s also been helping to promote theatre group Drama Box’s upcoming show in June titled Chinatown Crossings, which looks at the hidden histories of the area. In a way, all these is a continuation of her book, which was an effort not just to tell her story but that of an overlooked community. “It was also about people who, no matter what happened or how hard lives were, made the best of what they had. These are the stories of the early immigrants, of people who laid down the foundations for Singapore. Without these people, we probably wouldn’t have what we have today.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/chinatown-heritage-history-sago-lane-keong-saik-road-10210256"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 03:56PM", "tags": ["SCDF", "Kok Yuen Chin"], "author": "Aqil Haziq Mahmud", "title": "Drowning of SCDF NSF: Incident a ‘clear violation’ of rules, says Shanmugam", "content": " SINGAPORE: Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam on Monday (May 14) pledged to get to the bottom of the incident that left one Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) full-time national serviceman (NSF) dead.

Mr Chan said it is “not enough” to find the strongest set of individuals but there is a need too to mould them into the strongest team possible. This sense of teamwork, he added, does not just exist within one generation but also between generations. “Our leadership model is to have overlapping generations of leadership teams to help the next generation do even better,” the minister said. “This provides continuity in our interaction with others and for us to compete at the highest global level with consistency in vision and execution with purpose. “All these leadership traits – commitment, teamwork, courage to evolve, a sense of mission – are what we will need to keep our systems special,” he added. Mr Chan also pointed out that his belief is for the need of political leaders, not just politicians, to lead the country. These are leaders who weigh the options carefully before acting decisively and never opting for the most expedient idea or a solution for personal interests or short-term gains. “It also means not shying away from making difficult or unpopular decisions, but being guided by that resolve to always do what is in the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans - never shirking responsibilities towards our current and future generations,” he said. Additionally, there is a need to keep politics “constructive” and not make it just about winning votes, Mr Chan stressed. To win the heart and votes of the people, he said the Government must work hard to develop sound policies for the country’s common future. “To win votes by stoking anger and unhappiness may be a common practice in politics elsewhere. This is negative politics and is not constructive,” the minister added.  “THANK YOU MR LOW” Mr Chan, whom many have identified as being one of the frontrunners to succeed current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also took the opportunity to thank former Workers’ Party chief Low Thia Khiang for his contributions. Mr Low had recently handed over the reins as the opposition party’s secretary-general to Mr Pritam Singh, although he remains in its Central Executive Council.   He said while Mr Low sat on the opposite bench, he is a fellow Singaporean and very much part of Team Singapore. “While we may not always agree with his perspectives or methods, we nevertheless appreciate his efforts to work together to build a better Singapore,” Mr Chan said. “Although Mr Low may have different perspectives, but from his speeches, we can detect his pride in Singapore and his determination to defend our sovereignty. “Thank you Mr Low.” The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) Government also looks forward to working with Mr Singh and the WP to “put Singapore’s and Singaporeans’ interest first, always”, Mr Chan added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-must-have-strongest-leadership-team-for-others-to-take-10231704"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 02:40PM", "tags": [], "author": "Kevin Kwang", "title": "Attracting good people to serve ‘a never-ending challenge’, says Chan Chun Sing", "content": " SINGAPORE: The challenge of bringing in good people to serve is a “never-ending” one, but the Government must try, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (May 14), even as he highlights what the “pioneers of our generation” must do to create a brighter future for Singaporeans.

On the other hand, it is difficult to bring in good people who would sacrifice their personal and family interests for the country, especially when the country is already successful, peaceful and prosperous. “But we must continue to try,” the minister said. He said the need to find the strongest set of individuals is not just for solving problems, but to prevent future problems from happening in the first place. This means a need for diverse skillsets and perspectives so these can be combined when necessary to tackle the challenges. And the need to find these good people cannot be left to chance, Mr Chan stressed, adding that the PAP Government will spare no effort to do so and that this applies to both political leadership as well as public service and the business community. “Agreeing with us is not the pre-requisite. Agreeing to put Singapore first and foremost is the pre-requisite,” he said. BE “CLEAR-EYED” ABOUT CHALLENGES Besides attracting good leaders, Mr Chan also warned against the country adopting a conservative mindset. He said as a society matures, it usually becomes more conservative and choose to uphold existing systems rather than break new grounds. But to be pioneers of our generation, the Government must be “cleared-eyed” about the challenges the country faces. This means needing to keep up Singapore’s “vitality and verve”. “It is one thing to be the best-in-class for ports and airports. But it is another, to be even better - ready for tomorrow’s needs, ahead of time,” Mr Chan said. “It is one thing to beat others in a competition, it is another to beat our own standards, even when we are at the top, so that Singaporeans have even better opportunities.” He pointed out that enterprises must innovate and scale up and be better at translating investments in research and development into new capabilities and enterprise. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Enterprise Singapore will work closely with companies to realise this, and Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat will reveal more details in time to come, he added. UPHOLDING SOCIAL MOBILITY MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY Another aspect of a maturing society is that social mobility tends to slow, with social inequality becoming more apparent over time, the minister said. This, Mr Chan said, is often the result of “social clustering” of people from similar backgrounds as well as human’s natural instinct to pass on wealth and privilege to their next generation. “If left unchecked, our people may lose faith in our system of meritocracy and this can hurt our social compact,” he warned. As such, upholding social mobility and making sure the fruits of growth are better distributed to a broad majority is “something that we must take seriously”, Mr Chan said. Everyone must have a good start and progress to achieve their full potential, which means ensuring opportunities “remain accessible to all who are hardworking, talented and committed”. Additionally, opportunities must not be tied to academic grades, but also the right aptitude and skills, he added. This echoes what President Halimah Yacob said in her address last week, when she called for inequality to be tackled vigorously. “We need to provide the right additional support to those needing it – in housing, education, skills training, and employment – so that meritocracy works well. Only then can everyone do well through hard work, talent and skills, regardless of their backgrounds,” Mdm Halimah said then. Above all, Mr Chan said the “most critical piece” of their work is to rally the nation together.  He exhorted Singaporeans to not be “economic sojourners” but to have a natural instinct to defend what is ours, build upon what the country has and stay put “even when the chips are down”. “A nation is not just about economic benefits,” the minister said. “It is also about the sense of community and contribution. “A true nation is one where its people will stay and fight for our future and build it all up even when the chips are down.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/attracting-good-people-to-serve-a-never-ending-challenge-says-10231716"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 01:37PM", "tags": ["Singapore Exchange", "Tel Aviv Stock Exchange"], "author": "", "title": "SGX partners Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to boost capital for tech companies", "content": " SINGAPORE: The Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) announced on Monday (May 14) that they have established a partnership focused on growing capital raising opportunities for companies, particularly in the technology sector.

The NSF who died, Corporal (CPL) Kok Yuen Chin, had gone into the pump well at Tuas View fire station as part of activities to celebrate his impending ORD with squad mates. The pump well is a reservoir of water used by fire station personnel for training and for testing the pumps of fire engines. At the time of the incident, the water level in the well was about 1m from the opening, said SCDF in response to media queries.  SCDF said it appears the \"mishap\" arose as a result of activities which it has prohibited. Two SCDF regulars - a Staff Seargeant and a First Warrant Officer - were arrested on Monday as police conduct investigations. When CPL Kok did not resurface from the pump well, a number of personnel jumped in to find him but failed, SCDF said. \"CPL Kok was eventually pulled out from the well after the water had been drained,\" it added. A paramedic \"immediately\" administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and used an automated external defibrillator, SCDF said. CPL Kok was then taken by ambulance to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, it added. \"The police are conducting investigations on what had happened, including how CPL Kok fell into the pump well, and whether any person(s) are criminally responsible,\" SCDF said. A Board of Inquiry will also be convened to look into the case, it added, with full details to be made public. \"SCDF is saddened by his death and extends our deepest condolences to his family. We are providing all necessary assistance to the family during this difficult time,\" it said. SCDF said it has meted out \"severe punishments and deterrent action\" to personnel who engaged in unauthorised activities in the past. \"We continually educate our personnel, including during their foundation courses, briefings at recruit and specialist levels, as well as at periodic intervals, to make clear to our officers the risks of such activities and that they are prohibited,\" it added. \"They are also warned by their commanders. SCDF also has a whistle-blowing programme in place to help identify irresponsible behaviour. SCDF will be conducting briefings in all its fire stations and bases, and check again whether there were any such activities in the recent past.\" In response to media queries, SCDF said CPL Kok is Malaysian and a Singapore permanent resident. His family has taken his body back to Malaysia, it added.  This incident comes two weeks after the death of another NSF. Dave Lee, 19, died after \"displaying signs of heat injury\" in Bedok Camp. A Committee of Inquiry has been convened to investigate the circumstances leading to the death of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Guardsman.

HSA has warned the public not to consume two health products: Ausbee Australia® Ausbee Herbal Powder Capsules and Shen Loon She™ Edoly Capsule. In a news release, HSA said that several potent Western medicinal ingredients that are prohibited were found in the products, including ibuprofen, dexamethasone and chlorpheniramine. In the woman's case, the long-term consumption of dexamethasone, a potent steroid present in the herbal powder capsule, resulted in complications after a surgery for a fracture.  \"She underwent surgery due to a fracture and suffered complications arising from an adrenal crisis which caused a severe drop in her blood pressure,\" said HSA, adding that the woman had been using the herbal powder capsules for about two years after obtaining it from Malaysia to relieve her back pain and for general well-being. In addition to the steroid, the product is also adulterated with antibiotics, a painkiller and an anti-allergy drug which can cause serious adverse reactions and drug interactions, said HSA.

Consumers are advised to see a doctor as soon as they can if they have consumed any of the products containing the potent steroid.  HSA warned that discontinuing steroids without proper medical supervision can cause \"serious withdrawal symptoms\" like fatigue, confusion and low blood pressure, especially if the products have been consumed for more than a few weeks.  Additionally, HSA has urged consumers to be wary of health products that promise quick results for chronic conditions and products from unfamiliar sources.  Sellers and suppliers have also been directed to cease sales of the products immediately. \"Anyone who supplies illegal health products is liable to prosecution and if convicted, may be imprisoned for up to 3 years and/or fined up to $100,000,\" added HSA.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hsa-raises-alert-on-two-health-products-containing-potent-10230876"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 11:46AM", "tags": ["transport", "MRT", "Land Transport Authority"], "author": "Elizabeth Neo", "title": "New system to show commuters crowd levels on trains ", "content": " SINGAPORE: A new system that can help channel commuters to less crowded train cars is being piloted along the Downtown Line by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) starting on Monday (May 14).  The Passenger Load Information System (PLIS) displays the load levels in each train car through LCD screens at the MRT platforms using three colour-coded icons - red, amber and green.  An emptier train car is colour-coded green while a train car with limited standing capacity is colour-coded red. Amber is somewhere in between, and commuters can expect these train cars to have standing space but possibly no available seats.  \n\n\n\n\n The PLIS, which is similar to a system used on the Yamanote Line in Tokyo, detects the passenger load through load sensors that are already on trains. The data is then transmitted wirelessly at one-second intervals to the next train station, according to LTA. When incoming trains reach the next station, the information is also updated as passengers alight and board.  LTA's Director for Rolling Stock and Depot Engineering Chia Choon Poh said commuters can use the information to move to less crowded train cars for easier boarding. “This will better allow them to decide which platform door to board the trains or they may choose to wait for the next train if the oncoming train is crowded. And also, we think this system will be able to help us optimise the train capacity,” he added.  The system will be rolled out on six stations on the Downtown Line, between Bugis and Chinatown, by the end of Monday before it is extended to all 34 stations on the rail line by next week.  LTA will monitor the system over a six month period to fine-tune it, as well as get commuter feedback, it said.  LTA added it would monitor the system over a six month period to fine-tune it, as well as get commuter feedback. One commuter, corporate lawyer C J Ng, said the feature could help to alleviate crowding.  “It actually helps us to know where to find more empty spaces so people don't crowd around the place where they can't get into the train - or if those that want to find seats, or if they want to spread out to a place where they can find seats more easily.\"  Meanwhile, 57-year-old Imah Jamin said the system could help her better secure a seat. “We know whether the cabin is empty or not, so we know that if it's full we will go the other cabin,\" she said. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-system-to-show-commuters-crowd-levels-on-trains-10230950"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 10:18AM", "tags": ["Singapore", "space", "technology"], "author": "", "title": "'Weather patterns' delay Singaporean's attempt to travel to edge of space", "content": " ALICE SPRINGS, Australia: A pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force was forced to delay his attempt to travel to the edge of space because of \"weather patterns\", said the project's deputy campaign director Patsy Ong on Monday (May 14). Yip Chuang Syn who has been flying for more than 20 years, was set to traverse altitudes that surpass his experience and go where no Singaporean has gone before.  \"In some ways, I've always dreamt of going to space. While this isn't exactly going into space, you know, it's still going to the Armstrong line, which is something no Singaporean has achieved before,\" Mr Yip told Channel NewsAsia before his attempt.  But his planned take-off in the capsule from Alice Springs in Australia was not to be - at least for now. The flight was cancelled on Monday - one day before the actual take-off date.  \"Most of us didn’t see it coming because when you are into a mission, you want to achieve it and make it happen,\" said Ms Ong about Mr Yip's endeavour. Mr Yip had arrived in Alice Springs for the final preparations on Friday. According to Ms Ong, Mr Yip had done a \"full dress rehearsal and conducted a two-hour test in the capsule\". However, despite being technically prepared for the flight, the team was \"not in control of weather patterns\" and added that it was \"too windy to send a man up in space\". \"The wind has grown stronger and obviously the arrival of jetstream (fast moving air currents in the atmosphere) has definitely put a stop to our mission at this stage because it’s way out of our limits. \"The amount of risk involved is exponential,\" said Ms Ong. As for when the project can be resumed, advisor to the mission Professor Lui Pao Chuen said that it would take six or 12 months. \"There are so much resources put together for the mission and we got to wait six months or 12 months for the next window. So the next window is not going to be 2 weeks time. It’s going to be in six months or 12 months,\" said Professor Lui. MULTIPLE DELAYS The ambitious project was led by innovator Lim Seng who is the founder of Singapore-based technology firm IN.Genius in order to \"break boundaries\". \"The whole purpose (of the project) is to break boundaries, break mindsets, do difficult things.  And as I always say from Day 1: Our intent is to show our fellow citizens that we, from a small country, can also do this if we put our minds, hearts and guts together,\" said Lim Seng. Lim Seng first announced his idea in February 2013 to send the first Singaporean across the Armstrong Line, which is 20km into space. He aimed to do this using a stratospheric helium balloon that is typically used by space agencies like NASA to conduct scientific missions. \"It's just very interesting to be able to just have somebody, a leader, a visionary like Lim Seng, to set this goal where we can try to work together to try achieve this for Singapore.\" The flight was originally planned for take-off in 2015 during the SG50 celebrations, but faced delays \"due to various reasons\", said the team. Despite the setbacks, the team continued to perform two stratospheric flight tests in Alice Springs in May 2016 and was given in-principle approval for a man flight in Alice Springs by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia (CASA). Following this, the space suit's interface design was confirmed in January 2018 and Lim Seng announced the official flight date to be on May 15.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/weather-patterns-delay-singaporean-s-attempt-to-travel-to-edge-10230598"}, {"datetime": "14 May 2018 07:31AM", "tags": ["Indonesia", "terrorism", "Lee Hsien Loong", "Halimah Yacob", "Joko Widodo"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore leaders send condolences on bomb blasts in Indonesia", "content": " SINGAPORE: President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote to Indonesian President Joko Widodo with their condolences on the bomb attacks near three churches in Surabaya on Sunday (May 13).

This is part of Singapore’s Smart Nation Sensor Platform project, which could see all of Singapore’s 110,000 lamp posts fitted with a network of wireless sensors, to transform them into \"smart lamp posts\".  POSSIBLE USES OF SMART LAMP POSTS Currently, prototypes are being tested to determine the kind of technological capabilities that can be incorporated. For example, environmental sensors could potentially be added to monitor rainfall, humidity and temperature, and noise sensors to detect unusually loud sounds, such as a person screaming or a car crash. With video sensors, it would be possible to incorporate facial recognition systems. Navigational beacons could also be mounted to direct autonomous vehicles while speed-trap sensors could be used to track speeding bicycles or personal mobility devices. Citing this as an example, SNDGO’s Deputy Secretary Tan Kok Yam described how these smart lamp posts can be put to good use. “We want to look at places where people most frequently use active mobility devices,” he said.  “If we know where these places are, we can look at the infrastructure and the signage, to make the place safer. You want to know whether people are speeding or not for public safety reasons. \"If there is a bad collision, would a visual sensor be able to pick that up? And if that happens, would we be able to respond with emergency services?” PRIVACY FEARS Despite their potential, some aspects of the smart lamp posts have sparked concerns about privacy, especially the platform’s prospective ability to recognise faces. But Mr Tan tried to allay such fears. “We have no plans to use it to probe into how people live their lives,” he said.  “The whole point of the sensor platform is to look at improving services, look at how to run the city and operate the city better and how to plan the city better. We have no plans to do moral policing or things like that.” According to Professor Archan Misra from Singapore Management University’s School of Information Systems, better education and disclosure is the solution to such concerns. He said: “You want the public agencies to be more upfront about what they’re using them for and to highlight the positive use cases.\"   \"Admittedly there will be a very tiny sliver of cases, when you’re tracking a person of interest, criminal on the run, and you’re going to be using all this infrastructure to monitor those and track them. But that’s going on already, there’s no surprise and there’s high public acceptance of that.” Instead, the professor warned that cybersecurity threats such as hacking and data leaks could be bigger dangers. “Some of the things I've heard is that there is potential that a lot of the communication infrastructure is based on things such as Wi-Fi. These are unlicensed spectrum, meaning they are sort of more vulnerable to threats, because anybody can bring a laptop and start messing around with these,\" he said.  \"So you (have) got to have a higher level of security for some of those.” SNDGO, though, says the data collected will be safe, and there will be measures to prevent misuse. “Internally we have access controls to make sure that those accessing any kind of sensor or personal data have a purpose, are allowed to do so,\" said Mr Tan.  \"We will be able to track whoever who accesses the data in a matter that is not relevant, that does not gel with what the officer is supposed to do.  As for those who misuse or abuse the access to personal data, they will be penalised.\" SMART NATION FOR THE FUTURE For now, the agencies behind the project still need to determine whether the technology behind their vision of the smart lamp posts is cost-effective, feasible and can be used to solve real-life problems. But Professor Misra said it is essential for Singapore to press on. “I think it’s important as a showcase of what Smart City infrastructure can be, because Singapore is a leading smart city in this part of the world, in ASEAN,” he said.  “There’s a lot of Smart City investments that are upcoming, and our ability to show that we can do it right positions us to be a top leader, to have the right business contracts and enable these cities to come up to speed over the next decade.” He believes the smart lamp post is still at least four years away from reaching a level where its capabilities will match its intent.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smart-lampposts-singapore-wont-shine-light-peoples-lives-10229804"}, {"datetime": "13 May 2018 07:34PM", "tags": ["Mothers' Day"], "author": "", "title": "3,000 people turn up for Mother's Day charity walk with Mediacorp artistes", "content": " SINGAPORE: Some 3,000 members of the public took part in a charity walk at Marina Barrage to celebrate Mother's Day on Sunday (May 13).

Since May, we have been repeatedly told via print and online media that mothers are to be affirmed, celebrated and thanked. Brands everywhere – from retail and dining outlets to tourist attractions and food delivery apps – are cashing in on this nationwide fever to hail the modern mother.   It feels gratifying to be the centre of attention and to have someone else make dinner reservations for a change. (Even better if there is a pedicure or massage treatment thrown in.) But what do mothers really want and need? Surely there has to be more than an annual token celebration before heading back to reality (which includes changing soiled diapers and slaving away in the kitchen)?    THE MANY EVOLVING NEEDS OF A MUM Every mother has diverse needs and desires. When we have a newborn, the bar is set low. A warm 10-minute shower before collapsing in bed would be nice; so would a decent stretch of sleep after. When the kids become toddlers, we start to crave real company. (You know, another human being who doesn’t burp and fart at the most inconvenient of times, and shout “no” in our faces whenever we try to strike up a conversation.) When we pack them off to school, we hug them tight with tears trickling down our cheeks. If we are honest, these are both tears of sorrow and of joy, made up in equal parts of “Where did my baby go?” and “Hurray, I officially have a life!” During the first 12 years of parenthood, a mother’s identity is very much embroiled with their child’s; you can’t tell where one ends and the other begins. (Just look at the Instagram feed of any mum.) Each day feels like a chipping away at an unending to-do list.  Granted, the first few years of your child getting used to the world can be tumultuous and therefore deserving of your fullest attention. But it’s easy to get swept away by the whirlwind of motherhood, and forget that we exist as separate beings from our children. As we marvel at our children growing and developing, we forget to marvel at, and applaud, our own growth. And ironically, when our children require less and less of us, the space gets too big for us to bear, and we are unsure of what to do with ourselves. FIND A SELF THAT GOES BEYOND 'MOTHER' At the start of the year, a good friend presented me with a book that had “Fall in love with your life” emblazoned in gold across the cover. In it are pages of inspiring quotes about life and love, and prompts to help you pen your thoughts about what you appreciate most about life. For all the mothers among us, when was the last time you had fun doing something you love? When was the last time you read a book and felt utterly at one with the protagonist? When was the last time you had a good laugh with friends who understand you, and appreciate your unique personhood and points of view? Motherhood is not martyrhood – that tragic situation where you allow your dreams and self-identity to pass away, buried under a mountain of dirty laundry. But I have no time and energy left for this, you say? Such a reaction is commonplace. Finding yourself amidst the parenting hustle is no easy call. How can we create breathing space in a way that does not collide with our responsibilities as mothers? How can we come up for air every now and then? BREAKING FREE FROM THE MARTYR MENTALITY Like every other mother out there, I want the best for my children.  But what many of us don’t realise is that we first need to reconnect with our lost selves – our dreams and ambitions, and discover our post-motherhood selves, before we can give our family our best. This is not a form of hedonism but an expression of healthy self-love.   Madeleine L’Engle, in trying to answer some of life’s existential questions, wrote:  Every so often I need OUT – away from all these people I love most in the world – in order to regain a sense of proportion. We need to peel ourselves away from home to reclaim our identities. There are simple steps we can take, and we would be wise to start small. It could be cultivating a weekly ritual of me-time. A brunch date with different friends each week perhaps, or a quiet cafe spot just to journal and collect yourself from a busy week. Replace old unhealthy habits with new fitter ones. (Some friends of mine recently started skipping, and they keep score, which is a great way to keep each other motivated.) Find meaningful pursuits outside the home. Maybe join a soup kitchen or pick up a hobby you’ve always enjoyed. Do volunteer or part-time work, or take up an interesting course. Dig deep within your soul.

REGAIN A SENSE OF PROPORTION THIS MOTHER'S DAY In the words of Eleanor Roosevelt:  Remember always that you not only have the right to be an individual, you have an obligation to be one. Mothers, you are definitely worth celebrating. For all those times you’ve loved enduringly and nourished your family’s bodies, minds and spirits, do the same for yourself. By all means, relish that dinner treat and sweet handwritten card by your little ones. Bask in the hugs and kisses. But after that, go ahead and schedule some time-off for yourself. Book a retreat and take a day to re-discover your true self – not the one who’s constantly feeding mouths, and chauffeuring little people from place to place. When your first child begins to leave the nest 10, 15 years down the road, your future self will be your own rock to lean on. She will thank you for doing this, and so will your family.

The 2018 iteration of the QS Top Universities Ranking places Nanyang Technological University (NTU) at 11th place and the National University of Singapore (NUS) at 15th. Not bad for a small city-state that has only been in existence for little more than 50 years. Yet as critiques of university rankings have rightly pointed out, such rankings do not paint a complete picture of higher education, focusing instead on faculty research output.  At the same time, university graduate starting salary figures are but one marker of the quality of university education. As those of us who work and teach at universities know, higher education is much more than the rank of a university or how much money our students can earn upon graduation. In focusing on these quantifiable outcomes, we often negate the fundamental goals of education in any society: Shaping well-rounded students who possess both the hard skills necessary for their employment as well as the soft skills needed for good citizenship.

READ:  A commentary on the unhealthy biases arising from graduate employment surveys. SERVICE LEARNING AS MEANS TO A HOLISTIC EDUCATION One way of ensuring such as well-rounded education is through a pedagogical tool known as “service learning”. Indiana University education scholars Robert Bringle and Julie Hatcher (1996) have described service learning as: A credit-bearing educational experience in which students participate in an organised service activity that meets identified community needs and reflect on the service activity in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of the discipline, and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility. As a credit-bearing component of a degree course, service learning differs from community service (which is entirely voluntary and non-mandatory) and internships (which is essentially a paid service). Furthermore, service learning is not a one-way process. Service learning requires students to reflect on the process and allows them to pick up important skills and knowledge, such as the ability to foster collective action and ground-up initiatives or the ability to engage a broader range of groups and individuals, even as it allows them to contribute to the activities of grassroots organisations. For the past semester, I have been running a service-learning initiative as part of a core course under NTU’s Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme. As part of this initiative, students participate in a 6-week attachment at a grassroots organisation. At the end of the attachment, students are asked to write a reflection essay based on their experience. Aside from the essay, students’ performance are also assessed through the collection of feedback from external organisations and partners where the students have been attached. By incorporating community service into core curriculum, service learning allows for a more holistic educational experience, where learning takes place both within and outside the classroom.  This is especially important for public policy students, since it is meaningless to talk about policies without understanding how these policies impact citizens at the individual and community levels. Certainly, the soft skills picked up by students will benefit their future employers immensely. Their experience in engaging a broad range of citizens and facilitating ground-up initiatives will be especially relevant in business areas that require them to steer stakeholder relations or drive project management.  UNIVERSITIES IN COMMUNITY  Aside from ensuring a more holistic educational experience, service learning also grants universities the opportunity to engage their local communities.  By requiring students to be engaged in community service activities as part of their educational experience, universities can foster long-term relationships between their students and their immediate neighbourhoods and communities. More than simply educational institutions or spaces for learning, universities are spatially located within neighbourhoods. Service learning can contribute to NTU’s ongoing efforts to engage its Jurong and Pioneer neighbourhoods as well as the upcoming Jurong Innovation District. It should, however, be noted that community engagement is not entirely new to NTU. Indeed, the university has established a Local Community Engagement Office for this very purpose. The Office has since facilitated various activities and events for residents of the neighbouring Jurong area. For academics, service learning presents an opportunity to align one’s teaching and research activities to community service.  Given that much of our research funding derives from public monies, academics should also be obliged to ensure that their teaching and research activities provide direct positive impact to local communities and their residents.  SKILLS AND CIVIC CONSCIOUSNESS  Singapore’s education system has traditionally prided itself as a means of skills development and social mobility.  By ensuring equal access to education and imbuing students with relevant skills, the education system has been a crucial component of Singapore’s economic and social development. Service learning can contribute to both of these aspects of Singapore’s education system. Apart from allowing students to pick up useful job skills such as project management and stakeholder engagement, it also fosters a deeper sense of civic consciousness that is strongly tied to community service.  Such skills cannot be learnt through traditional pedagogical tools but requires students to “learn in action” by engaging with local communities. In the words of the education philosopher John Dewey: “There is no such thing as educational value in the abstract”. A well-rounded education should require students to understand the lives and conditions of their fellow citizens, not in the abstract, but in community. Service learning provides good opportunities for such engaged learning. Woo Jun Jie is an assistant professor in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme of Nanyang Technological University.

When completed, Tengah Town will grow to about 700 hectares, roughly equivalent to Bishan in size,\" Mr Wong said.

It will be a green, car-lite, and pedestrian-friendly town. \"With the recent announcement of the 24km Jurong Region Line (JRL), residents in Tengah can also look forward to excellent connectivity, with four JRL stations connecting the town to Jurong Innovation District, Jurong Lake District and beyond. Within Tengah, we are also looking to enhance last-mile connectivity through autonomous vehicles,\" the Minister added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/forest-town-tengah-s-first-batch-of-hdb-flats-to-be-launched-in-10229232"}, {"datetime": "13 May 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["On the Record", "Yaacob Ibrahim"], "author": "Bharati Jagdish", "title": "Prejudice, politics and the public’s trust: On the Record with former minister Yaacob Ibrahim", "content": " SINGAPORE: As Dr Yaacob Ibrahim arrives for our interview, it becomes clear that old habits die hard. My colleagues and I address him as “Minister Yaacob” several times. After all, he was first appointed Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports and Acting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs in 2002. The following year, he became a minister and went on to serve in various ministries for the last 16 years. Still, Mr Yaacob corrects us. “I’m no longer Minister,” he says, laughingly. The recent Cabinet reshuffle saw him stepping down as Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs and Cyber Security to allow younger, fourth-generation leaders to take on more responsibilities. But he is still very much a Member of Parliament. And while he has said in previous interviews that he will use his free time to catch up on his reading among other things, he points out that his work on the ground as MP for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency (GRC) continues. To listen to the full interview, click here.  “WE ALWAYS ANTICIPATE A FIGHT” In fact, some analysts are saying that Jalan Besar GRC is likely to be hotly contested in the next election as it will be one of those left without an anchor minister. I ask him if he envisages an erosion of support from the ground as a result. “We just have to be ready,” says Dr Yaacob confidently.   “We always anticipate a fight. Whether an erosion of support will happen or not, we have to prevent it from happening. We have to work hard.\" He says he has briefed all his key grassroots leaders. “Between now and the next election, I have to prepare the team. The most important thing is just to make sure that when the button is pressed, we are ready to go.” His next statements, however, suggest some uncertainty as to whether he will even run. “Whoever takes over my place, he will know that the system is in place. Everything is there for him or her to take over and I’ll be there to guide him or her to make sure we win the next election. Whether I’m around or not, that’s immaterial.” STEPPING OUT OF POLITICS ALTOGETHER? When directly asked if he will be running as an MP, his initial reply is brief. “You have to ask the Prime Minister that.” But as we continue talking he admits that while he does not know for certain if he will run, he has other considerations.  “I’ll be very candid. My family wants me to step down. They think I’ve been there for a long time and I need to look to other things to do in my life.  They all know that I work very hard. They’ve seen how it has stressed me out in the last 22 years. I suppose they feel that now it’s time for me to do something else that will be more relaxing. “But I’m a party man. I shall wait on instructions from the Prime Minister. Whatever comes my way, I have to make all the evaluations and re-prioritise accordingly,” he says with his signature good-natured laugh. While his family wants him to step down, I wonder what he himself wants. “I want to continue to contribute. I have always been that person who cannot stay idle. I don’t imagine myself sitting by and watching history go by. If I continue as MP, I will play my role as MP. If not, I will have to find other roles for myself.” As we continue talking, it’s clear he still sees a role for himself, and he is keeping his options open. “I’m not retiring as a member of the Muslim community. There’s a new Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs. I will not get in his way but I will find a space where I can operate, to continue to contribute my part. “At the national level, I think the digital economy and digital transformation is an interesting evolution that is taking place. I’ve been a part of it for the last seven years as Minister for Communications and Information. How can I play a role to see that transformation taking place?” A QUESTION OF TRUST In the meantime, he speaks fondly about engaging the residents in his constituency as an MP, which he has been doing since 1997. He admits he had concerns initially about not being able to connect with the majority Chinese community because of the language barrier. He has picked up some Mandarin over the years. “Yi dian dian (a little bit),” he says to prove it. Dialects were the other challenge. “In a way, by saying a few words in the dialect, I can break the ice. It helps. I cannot pretend that I know the language well, but I think they know who I am. “I’ve always believed one of the lessons I’ve learnt from Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He said that what you want is to be able to shake hands with the person and have the person look into your eyes and say, 'I trust this chap to look after my affairs'. I think that’s what’s important.” Language was not the only barrier. He also had no idea what living in an HDB estate was like. Dr Yaacob’s father worked as a lawyer's clerk and his mother was a housewife. The family was large – nine children in all and couldn’t afford a home till Dr Yaacob was in secondary school. They lived in kampungs for all his growing-up years. “My sister moved to landed property at some point, but that was the time I left and went overseas to do my PhD. When I came back, I lived in university housing.” To familiarise himself with HDB living before his first election, he made sure he visited every block twice. Nevertheless, I point out the oft-heard criticism that ministers are out of touch with the ground. “I don’t think that’s a fair criticism. I think our ministers are plugged in. You can check. Almost every weekend, all of us are down on the ground.”  ​​​​​​​ But can they relate to the realities of ordinary Singaporeans? I point out how, for example, whenever there are issues with the public transport system, many say our political leaders are not able to relate as they don’t make an effort to experience first-hand what it’s like to deal with such issues on a daily basis. “I appreciate where that’s coming from, but I don’t quite agree that is the yardstick that you should use. I would use this argument that I’ve used before: you want me to be a communist before I appreciate communism? I know what public transport is all about. I used to take public transport. Now, because of the nature of my job I have to move from place-to-place, so I have to take the car. I think the measure by which we must judge is how well can you relate to the minister and how well the minister can relate to his constituents. “I think we have to look at the totality of things that we do rather than whether we take the bus or not. I think that’s a bit too minutiae to use as a criteria. I don’t have to experience everything to appreciate the problem. I think the Ministers are concerned when there is a big problem and that we need to tackle that problem.” He maintains that ministers are fully cognizant of the importance of engendering trust.  “At the end of the day, it is the ground that will vote for us. We can have the fanciest policy but if the ground doesn’t trust us, that’s the end of it. We know that.” He admits that not everyone trusts them and some have been quite unrestrained in conveying that message. He has had his share of doors slammed in his face during house-to-house visits. “WE’RE NOT GOD” During the 2011 election, he admits that at least one resident brought up the issue of high ministerial salaries. In light of this, some might say the electorate’s high expectations are justified. He thinks expectations should be high regardless of salaries. “We expect people, including the ministers, to work their best. I’ve always believed that we are a small country with no margin of error. If you’re given a position or responsibility, you’d better do your job right and do the best that you can, but sometimes things may not work out. That’s the reality of life. I think what’s important is how we respond. The way we respond to a crisis has to be professional and constructive. You've seen incidents in other places where the agencies couldn't deal with the situation and the population gets inundated by other crises.” At this point, he raises several incidents that occurred under his watch which he seems to regret. One occurred in 2013 – the fire at Singtel's Bukit Panjang Internet exchange that affected banking and telecommunications services for eight days. “I was in-charge of telcos for the last seven years. When the fire took place, I couldn’t sleep because it meant that our system is vulnerable.” Since then, the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) has imposed new standards on Singtel to prevent a recurrence. “You have to do the best you can but can you anticipate every problem? It’s not possible. We’re not God. I am confident that at least for the ministry that I’ve been overseeing, the IMDA knows what needs to be done.” The flooding of Orchard Road in 2010, when he was Environment and Water Resources Minister, is also something he wishes had been avoided.   Many often recall how seven months before the flooding, he had described a flood along Bukit Timah Road as a \"freak event\" that happened once in 50 years. I ask him if he regretted making that statement. “I regretted not explaining that statement. People forget I’m an engineer by training. One in 50 is a probability concept for hydrology. I learnt that in school. It’s just a probability that this event can occur. But it doesn’t mean that it cannot happen tomorrow. I should have thought through more carefully how to explain that concept.” He admits that the incident taught him a lesson. “Nobody in PUB expected such a rainfall to happen. If you look at the chart of rainfall data that we have in PUB, that data point didn’t exist. One of the things we need is imagination, to think of the impossible and if it is really impossible, can it still happen or not? You have to plan for it.” Various anti-flooding measures have since been rolled out. I ask him what his sense of the ground is today, how happy or unhappy the electorate may be. “I think more positive compared to 2011. I think people understand where we are coming from. At the end of the day, we can alleviate some of the transport woes. I think all the ministers including current Transport Minister Mr Khaw Boon Wan showed that they are working very hard to try and solve the problem. “I think the concerns now are about the whole economy. People are worried about jobs. The Government is trying its very best to grow the economy. There are some concerns about cost of living but I think generally, they know that we are trying our very best.” A QUESTION OF RACE AND RELIGION Another role which he has found challenging is that of Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs. The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the US, when the Malay-Muslim community was under the spotlight, was especially tough for him as he had only just taken the helm then.  The discovery of the Jemaah Islamiyah plot in Singapore soon after exacerbated matters.  \"For us to be in that type of limelight is never pleasant but it is something which is part of leadership and you have to deal with it.\" Today, he is encouraged by the strides that have been made in Singapore especially in terms of inter-faith dialogue and understanding, but he says the work has to continue. There were numerous other issues that proved challenging over the years. “There was a growing concern amongst some segments of the Government that we’re becoming conservative and we were becoming exclusionary. It cast a perception that the Malay community wants to be isolated. But when I went down to the ground, I could see integration taking place in everyday life. Sometimes we are the victims of one or two people who are louder than others.” He saw it as “a very important challenge to educate the Government that that’s not what we are all about”. But he also had to explain to the community why the Government was concerned. “Sometimes when the Government raises these concerns, it’s not because there is a denial or suspicion about the community, but they are worried about the larger picture about how we can hold the nation together. They are not opposed to Muslim religious practices but we want to see how we can find that balance. The issues of tudung, handshaking and greeting and the issues of whether more Malays want to go to madrasah and so on - those were the issues that I had to confront and they are not the easiest of issues.” He appreciates the fact that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had several sessions with the community to understand the issues. But this is not to say all the issues are resolved. “I think this tension will always exist and we will always have people who will come out with different ideas. It is a continuous balancing act. \"I always saw myself as that person in the middle, balancing between the concerns of the Government and the needs of the community. I always felt that it was my job to make sure that I articulate both points of view so that the Government can understand better.\" I suggest however that some within the community might feel as if he did a better job of representing the Government’s interests than of standing up for the community’s interests. “There will always be suspicion because I’m a Government man, I have to speak the Government lingo. But I’m also a community man. My heart is always with the community. I hope that in the last 16 years I’ve been able to convince them I have their interests at heart. We may differ in our approach, but I think the intent is the same. I would say, let history judge. I can’t say anything else.” Another issue that became a lightning rod for criticism was that of the reserved Presidential Election. It brought the Malay-Muslim community under the spotlight as last year’s Presidential Election was reserved for Malay candidates. I put to him that many within the community felt that it implied that Malays could never be president on their own merit. “When the idea was first discussed, I was uncomfortable for those very reasons. But having thought through all the implications and reasons and why it goes beyond the individual, I realised it’s about the institution and how we need to preserve the multiracial character of the institution. “Sometimes in life, you cannot go on a perfect trajectory. You need to intervene. \"Our talent pool is not deep. That’s the honest truth. We have talented people, but we don’t have that depth of other communities like the Indian or the Chinese communities. \"So I decided on balance that this was the better approach and the most important thing is that the person must meet the criteria set out for any presidential candidate.” He notes that President Halimah Yacob meets the criteria and is “more than able to do the job”. “We may disagree with the circumstances in which she became President but she is now President. The hope is that six years later, people will forget that she is a Malay and only see and respect her as our President.” He has mentioned before that he hopes “the President is so good” that his or her race becomes a non-issue. But I ask him how confident he is that this will happen, since some still question the President’s legitimacy, despite her capabilities. “I’m not sure whether it’ll be enough but I think it’s necessary for any one of us who are given a position to influence public life, public policies, to do the best job we can.” As to whether he will ever consider running for President, he says he has “not thought about it yet” and that “it all depends on what I do in the next phase of my life” which he isn’t certain about at this time. I wonder if he envisions a day when race truly becomes a non-issue in politics. “I think the issue of race will not go away as some of us would like it to. But at the same time, the question is about how is the issue framed as we go forward.” He points to the rise in inter-racial marriages. “We have seen more convergence of the various communities. Will the CMIO (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others) racial categorisation model still be operable? So whether race will matter in future or not is for the next generation to decide.” DEALING WITH PREJUDICE Dr Yaacob often talks about the progress the Malay-Muslim community has made over the years in terms of education and socio-economic status. When he was growing up, he often felt the community was in the spotlight for the wrong reasons and the negative stereotypes affected him personally. “I was good at mathematics. But we had a Chinese math teacher who was very nasty, who basically degraded the Malay community and every time we went to class, we were told that we are only good at playing guitar or sitting at the void deck. So I was really upset. I continued to do my best to prove otherwise. “The world is filled with different people. People who are prejudicial carry on all these stereotypes. The most important thing for me is really to look forward on how you can use those learning experiences.”  He feels that as the Malay community progresses, such incidents have become far less common. His own consciousness about the issues surrounding his community became more acute in university. “When I entered the campus in 1976, a few Malay-Muslim students from the Muslim society had petitioned the late Dr Goh Keng Swee to see whether the Government could recruit more Malays into National Service. The issue at that time was that some Malays were not asked to serve National Service and it had some implications on their employment. Those concerns were what shaped me as a person.” He suggests that today, even this situation has improved markedly. “We see Malays serving in all sorts of roles. Some of them have risen through the ranks and become officers. I think Malays are now participating fully in the armed forces. We even have several candidates now going through naval training to become naval officers. “I think this is a healthy evolution of how the various communities have come together to trust one another. We share this island and we have to protect it together as one nation.” I wonder if that spirit can be extended to other areas of community life. For instance, the social and educational issues that exist within the Malay-Muslim community also exist in other communities. Why should they be tackled in the framework of racial groups? Could that end up being divisive and in fact have the effect of negatively singling out certain communities? “Frankly, I used to hold that view. But when I got involved with self-help groups, I realised that there is a value in having a community approach because when I reached out to my fellow Malay-Muslims, I could talk to them, I could understand the cultural nuances. For example, you must also know how to empower Malay-Muslim parents who may not be familiar with the latest curriculum in mathematics or familiar with what’s going on with the world. It’s a lot easier for me to go in and to speak to them in a language they can understand.” But he points out that the self-help groups have come together in recent years to run a common tuition programme for all races. “We have to continue to find ways in which we can evolve that model so that we can be more inclusive.” UNFINISHED BUSINESS He might have achieved a lot in his 16 years as a minister, but there are two initiatives that he wishes he had seen to fruition. One is his wish to set up an Islamic college in Singapore to train a new generation of religious teachers who understand Singapore’s multi-racial and multi-religious context. “We spent a lot of time developing the model. Hopefully, when it gets approved and it gets launched I can find a way to play a part to make that dream a reality.” He also mentions the Broadcasting Act that is due to be updated to take into account changes to the media landscape. I point out that recently, legislative changes related to the media have attracted criticism from some quarters who perceive it as the Government’s way of silencing dissenting voices. Several years ago, a licensing framework for online news media sparked similar criticism. He maintains there are good reasons for this. “If you are reporting on Singapore, we have to hold you accountable just as I hold the mainstream media accountable for their reporting. You can criticise the Government, but you must give us a right of reply.” He singles out the 2015 case of the now-defunct sociopolitical site The Real Singapore (TRS) as being different. An article it published claimed that a Filipino family complained about noise resulting in a scuffle between the police and participants at a Thaipusam procession. While this did not actually occur, the article had the potential of inciting hatred against the Filipino community in Singapore. “If you say something that is really untruthful, then we really have to come down hard on you. In this case, the intent was to peddle fake news so that they could attract eyeballs.” I ask him what he thinks of Singapore’s poor rankings in the World Press Freedom Index. “I have not gone into depth on their criteria. All I would say is that we are a different country. We’re a small country that was never supposed to be a country. We have fault lines that can be exploited – race, language or religion and we are such a small society that we hardly have a margin of error. “I’m not apologetic about what the Government has done.” But can’t Singaporeans be trusted to be discerning media consumers? Is the Government being paranoid, as some critics suggest, I ask him. “There has been a lot of content we’ve allowed online. It’s only when you cross certain red lines, that we come down hard because we have to protect the larger interests.” Another controversial issue that arose under his watch involved two gay-themed children's books. The National Library removed them from the children's section and planned to pulp them. Members of the public were divided on this. Some supported the move. Others bristled at the censorship. Later, the titles were moved to the adult section. “Our instincts were different at that time. In hindsight, we could have been more enlightened in our approach.” Today, his advice to younger Ministers is to “not just meet your grassroots leaders who always agree with you, but meet the people who disagree with you” so that “they can hear where you’re coming from and you can hear where they are coming from”. He claims that during his years in politics, he has done this several times. SINGAPORE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR When asked how he would like to be remembered, he says with a smile: “He did his best when he was given the opportunity. He made a couple of mistakes and he tried to move on and do whatever he could to make Singapore a better place for everyone.” One of the most vital tasks ahead for Singapore he says is to “empower generations of Singaporeans to really believe that Singapore is worth fighting for.” But he concedes that nation-building is a complex process. “At the end of the day, this is the only country we have and if we don’t do something to make sure this country continues to survive, continues to thrive, I think we would have lost the battle. “When I meet young people, I try to inspire them in some way, to show them that they have a role to play. We have to give young people a stake in Singapore’s future. We are asking for young people to take it upon themselves to do something to create a better future for themselves and their children.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/yaacob-ibrahim-former-minister-muslim-affairs-on-the-record-10223636"}, {"datetime": "13 May 2018 06:30AM", "tags": ["HDB"], "author": "Prabhu Silvam", "title": "Old HDB flats: Assets losing their value?", "content": " SINGAPORE: When Mrs Y L Dong and her family moved into their resale five-room Housing Development Board (HDB) flat 20 years ago, she was certain they had found their ideal home. The Ang Mo Kio apartment may have been 17 years old, but its age did not bother her. “We have all the necessary conveniences like coffee shops and wet markets nearby. It’s a really friendly neighbourhood with a cosy feel and it is also really convenient to get to town from here,” she said. But last year, when she approached a property agent with the intention of selling her flat, the response was poor. “After realising that the lease of the house was reaching its 40-year mark, most buyers weren’t keen at all. They were afraid they might not be able to sell it off in the future,” said the housewife who has two teenage children. “Even though the flat is spacious and opposite Bishan Park and near prestigious schools, no one wanted to buy.” Mrs Dong is not alone. A growing number of HDB flat owners are holding on to properties nearing the halfway point of their 99-year leases, raising mounting uncertainties of depreciating values, which have run counter to long-held narratives that Singaporeans’ HDB flats are not just homes, but also appreciating assets. Today, with older flats in the spotlight, the notion of asset-enhancement, which has seen HDB flat prices rise in the past few decades, is under threat.  And the larger question of what will happen to people’s HDB homes when leases actually end has become an issue of growing traction. Experts like Dr Fu Yuming put it starkly. “I know what will happen to a private estate when the land lease expires: it will revert to the government,” said the associate professor at the Department of Real Estate in National University of Singapore. “But I don’t know what the government is thinking about for the lease management of HDB estates, since there is no open discussion about the issue. In theory, the estates revert to HDB when their lease expires. But will there be any lease renewal policy or re-housing policy? The uncertainty needs to be resolved to protect the interest of HDB homebuyers.” DON’T COUNT ON EN-BLOC  The issue came under scrutiny last year after National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said in a blog post that the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) will apply only to a few flats, not all. His comments came after reports of buyers forking out high prices for ageing flats, in the hope of cashing in through SERS, where residents are rehoused in new blocks and also receive compensation for their old homes. But Mr Wong cautioned that SERS is a highly-selective scheme. Since it started in 1995, only 80 sites have been chosen. That makes up a mere 4 per cent of total HDB flats. There are about 70,000 flats which are more than 40 years old, all facing lease expiry in about 50 years. Among them, there will be owners who may have bought the new flats at a subsidised rate. But there will be a sizeable group who, like Mrs Dong, are resale flat owners and who bought these flats at a much higher price with the hope of making a profit. Many could be disappointed. If properties have to be handed back to the Government at the end of the 99-year lease, some owners of old flats may have to sell at a loss, assuming any buyer can be found. And if there are no buyers, owners will eventually be left with an asset which has negligible value. This despite the fact that they may have spent many hundreds of thousands of dollars on it. The first to cross the line will be the oldest HDB flats in Geylang, Jurong East and Queenstown, and property agents are reporting dips of up to 20 per cent for the prices of these flats, depending on the flat’s and the buyer’s age. “We have to educate sellers of these older flats that with the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Withdrawal Limit imposed, younger buyers are no longer keen,” said Ms Tracey Wong, chief executive officer at the Institute of Estate Agents, Singapore. “We then ask the sellers to be more realistic in their sale price in order to attract buyers.” The CPF Withdrawal Limit places a cap on how much a buyer can tap on his CPF for property purchases. The shorter the lease of a flat, the less CPF can be used. FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN Mrs Charan Singh, 78, is one of those who worries about the future even though she is not looking to cash in on her five-room flat in Marine Parade, which is 45 years old. She wants to bequeath the property to her children but wonders if she is passing on a worthless asset. “I’m content for now but once I die, my flat will go to my children,” she said. “If my house does not fall under the SERS policy what will happen to the value of my flat then? What will this mean for my children?” Experts say there is no point in speculating. Instead, they suggest that the authorities be more transparent, in engaging people more in discussions on the fates of their ageing homes. “The important question is how relevant policies should be debated and made,” said Dr Fu, urging more dialogue on lease management and potential re-housing solutions. HOME FIRST, ASSET NEXT On the part of Singaporeans, a shift in mindset would be useful, said analysts. Instead of seeing their flats as investments, they should view them primarily as homes. “HDB flats are public housing, so it needs to serve the needs of the housing demand first. The decision of buying and selling a HDB flat for investment purposes should not be the end game,” said Dr Tu Yong, associate professor at the Department of Real Estate in NUS. In this regard, homeowners can be assured that the Government will not allow ageing flats to be neglected, said observers. “The Government is committed to the upkeep of HDB estates regardless of SERS,” said Dr Fu. “There has been no general degradation of old HDB estates and, I believe, it is unlikely that the Government will allow general degradation to happen in the future.” “I’ve lived in this estate my whole life and all my memories have been built here,” she said. “I’m completely happy with my estate and I hope they never tear it down. There’s a lift on every floor and there are ramps around to help the elderly so I couldn’t ask for more really.” STILL A GOOD FIRST STEP While concerns are emerging about ageing flats, both experts and homeowners believe that many properties still retain some value, whether it’s monetary or other qualities. After all, the flats are still subsidised by the government, said Professor Sing Tien Foo, Director of Institute of Real Estate Studies in NUS. They can still use their HDB flat as the starting house, and accumulate wealth to support their upgrading aspirations as they move onto the next phase of their lives,”he added. If an old flat is in a good location or has easy access to key amenities, there is still a demand, said Ms Wong. It was this sort of demand that first attracted Mrs Keethanjali Prakaash, 27, to buy an executive maisonette at Serangoon North. “We were looking around for quite a bit and we finally settled here because it's near my parents’ house and it's also a really lovely neighbourhood with plenty of shops and other amenities nearby,” she said. When asked about her flat’s future resale options, she said that given the rarity of executive maisonettes, it will always offer a premium for buyers especially for large families looking for bigger spaces. The government has stopped building executive maisonettes since 1995.   “The housing market in Singapore is always changing and you never know what to expect - what was relevant 10 years ago isn’t now and the same goes for the next few years ahead. What’s important is living in a house that is conducive and comfortable for your family, that’s the only thing you can really control.” ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/old-hdb-flats-assets-losing-their-value-10224402"}, {"datetime": "13 May 2018 06:15AM", "tags": ["Gunung Pulai", "Malaysia", "CNA Insider"], "author": "Desmond Ng", "title": "'I knew my life was in danger': Singaporean hiker lost on Johor mountain", "content": " KULAI, JOHOR: Lost on Johor’s nearest mountain to Singapore, hiker Clarice Lum tried to sleep – but the fear of rolling down the steep slope, and the grunting of wild boars around them, kept her awake. In the dark of the Gunung Pulai forest reserve, she and her hiking companion could only just make out the creatures' shadows. “There were probably about four or five boars around us. We froze instantly. because we knew they’d attack us if they were provoked,” recalled the 27-year-old. “I knew that my life was in danger.” Telling her story to the programme On The Red Dot, in her first full interview since the pair went missing in February, Ms Lum described how a “simple hike” – one that normally takes hours – turned into a four-day nightmare when she and her friend strayed off course. (Watch the episode here.) Their disappearance and the subsequent search operations grabbed headlines and stirred social media buzz on both sides of the Causeway, with some 200 volunteers stepping forward to assist in the hunt. WATCH: A survivor's account (5:01)  FOREST'S SPOTTY HISTORY When fellow hiker Dominick Tan suggested climbing Gunung Pulai, it was a challenge Ms Lum readily accepted, even though she hardly knew him and had never been up that mountain before. “I’m a spontaneous person. Whenever my friends ask me to go for activities like rock climbing or sky diving, I’d be very game,” she said. This particular hike requires about three hours via the paved road, from the base of the mountain to the 654-metre summit and back. But the forest reserve has a problematic history: It was closed following a landslide that killed five people in 2001, and reopened only in 2016. Though Ms Lum was going to take the jungle path to the summit, she was undaunted because her companion – who declined to be interviewed for the programme – was said to be an experienced climber who had also trekked up Gunung Pulai several times. As it was supposed to be a half-day trip, they did not pack extra food or tents. They reached the first viewpoint after about three hours. “I was feeling very happy with the adrenalin,” said Ms Lum. “I couldn’t wait to reach the summit.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RED MEANS DANGER On the second leg of their climb, they noticed that the forest had become denser. “Dominick had to use his hands to push the leaves apart so that we could keep going through the forest,” she said. “That was when he cut his hand, and it started bleeding.” Worried that the wound would become infected, they decided to take what they thought was a shortcut, by following the red markers on some trees. With hindsight, Ms Lum said: “I don’t think it was the right shortcut.” In actuality, the red markers meant the area was dangerous and off-limits to climbers. \n\n\n\n\n Said Ms Lum: “It got denser and denser, and it was very hard to bash on through the forest. And it got steeper.\" By the late afternoon, she added, “we knew we were lost. That was when he decided to call the Bomba\", Malaysia's fire and rescue department. Kulai Fire and Rescue Station chief Mohd Khairi S Zainudin was puzzled as to how the two Singaporeans had got lost in the reserve, as it was a straightforward trekking area. “The first thing we did was to tell the victims to stay calm,” he said. We also instructed the victims not to move around so that we could find them more easily. His team pinpointed the duo’s possible locations based on information from Mr Tan, who had an app on his phone that could locate their coordinates. The coordinates suggested that the two were on Hill 308, where the red markings were, said Mr Mohd Khairi. But his team was unable to locate the hikers after four hours of searching. VENOMOUS ANIMALS The two hikers had to spend the night in the forest. “It was cold. We were wearing basic sports tops, and Dominick was wearing shorts,” said Ms Lum. We were on a very steep slope. And my fear was that I’d roll down the forest. I got very worried, and I couldn’t sleep. Then there was the wildlife, especially the wild boars wandering around. Mr Mohd Khairi knows only too well the dangers that lurk in the forest. “There are venomous animals, and there could be wild boar attacks,” he warned. “There are areas where the rocks are slippery. There had been a case where a victim died.” He mobilised a new team to take over for the morning search, though he himself did not sleep that night. “But being tired wasn’t my concern,” he said. “It was our duty to find them. We were determined to save them; we felt like our own siblings were in trouble.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That second day, the two climbers started rationing their food. They only had some packets of cashew nuts, potato chips and a couple of nutrition bars. And they faced a dilemma: Stay and wait for help, or search for water for survival. They decided to leave their location and were relieved to find a stream three hours later. “After collecting our water, we decided to follow the stream downwards,” said Ms Lum. “I thought it was a good idea to keep moving so that the wild animals wouldn’t follow us. But I was worried that (the search team) couldn’t find us,\" she added, as they were moving away from the coordinates they had given. SOCIAL MEDIA HELP Mr Mohd Khairi suspected that the two might have wandered off, even though they were told to stay put. His team of 60 split up to look for them over an ever-expanding area – with help from some 200 Malaysian and Singaporean volunteers. They joined in the search partly owing to the efforts of Ms Lum’s friend Chloe Quek, who had learnt on Facebook that her friend was lost and decided to galvanise social media users. “I updated all the posts to say that we needed volunteers with experience in hiking,” she said. “They could go down to the site to help the authorities.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ms Lum’s mother Ann Chia remembers waiting for her daughter at the foot of the mountain, hopeful with every returning team. “But the 100 to 200 trekkers returned with no news of her,” she said. “I cried non-stop.” Meanwhile, her daughter was particularly hungry, tired – and had been bitten by a leech while walking along the stream. “I was terrified,” she said. “My first instinct was to pull it off, but Dominick told me that I couldn’t … because the blood would gush out. He helped me to burn off the leech using his lighter.” The hikers even started to hallucinate at some point. “We were shouting, ‘Tolong! Tolong!’ (Help! Help!), and we heard something – we heard ‘Hello, are you there?’ from across the river. We said we were along the river, and the sound responded. It said, ‘OK,’” recalled Miss Lum. But it was just their imagination. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CROCODILES AND SNAKEHEADS Mr Tan was feeling very apologetic for putting his companion in this predicament. “I told him that it was okay, (that) we’d get out of there alive,” Miss Lum recounted. \"I still had so many things that I had yet to achieve. I had yet to travel around the world, to settle down … to buy a house for my parents. I really couldn’t die without accomplishing these things. On the fourth day, the Bomba team decided to concentrate on an area they had not yet searched – one the two hikers had ventured into. Said Mr Mohd Khairi: “That area is extremely dangerous, and we didn’t expect the victims to go there. There are crocodiles and giant snakehead (fish) there, which can attack humans.” The two tried building a raft to cross the water but gave up, as the logs were too heavy. They then decided to swim across the river. It was then that they heard the sound of a helicopter. They immediately started shouting to get its occupants’ attention. But the aircraft flew away, sending Ms Lum into a panic. She said: “I thought they didn’t see us, and I had a mix of emotions – of sadness and frustration.” But they had been spotted. Mr Mohd Khairi was on the rescue chopper, and at first, he thought the figures they saw in the river were fishermen. “Then I thought again – fishing is prohibited in that area. So we turned around … we were certain they were the victims.” WILL TO LIVE When the aircraft returned, Ms Lum was ecstatic. “I was crying. I was saying to Dominick, ‘I’m going to get out of here alive!’” Mr Mohd Khairi said he was the happiest person to have located them. “I was shocked because we didn’t expect their will to live to be so strong. Especially in such an extreme area, and in their injured condition.\" (Read: ‘No longer tired when I saw them’: Rescue commander on spotting missing Singaporeans at Gunung Pulai) The two, who suffered minor injuries, were sent to Pontian Hospital and then to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where Ms Lum took a blood test, was given an intravenous drip, and had her wounds cleaned. Some five weeks after the ordeal, the On The Red Dot team arranged for her to return to Johor, to visit her rescuers. She brought some gifts to thank them, and was surprised when the whole Bomba team turned up. “As I shook each and every one of their hands, I felt this tingling sensation of emotions. I was about to cry,” she said. “They gave me a second chance at life because without them, I’d still have been stuck in the forest, or I’d have died.” The Malaysian agencies’ efforts also drew praise from Singapore’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. When Mr Mohd Khairi ask Ms Lum if she would consider returning to Gunung Pulai to hike, she said yes, but not yet. “I’ll take my time to heal first. Once I’m ready, I’m sure (next) time, I’ll reach the summit,” she added.

But it will take two years for the scientists to complete their studies of more than 12,000 specimens - some bizarre and new to science - hauled up from the bottom of the Sunda Strait and Indian Ocean. These Indonesian waters off West Java had been largely unexplored by marine biologists until now. That changed in March, when a combined team from Singapore and Indonesia set out to sea. “People have collected data off west of Sumatra, eastern parts of Indonesia and southeastern part of Java,” said Professor Peter Ng, head of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum at the National University of Singapore (NUS). “But for whatever reasons, the Sunda Strait in southwestern and southern Java were poorly collected. We had almost no information about the deep-sea animals living there.  So we thought, here’s a nice chance to fill the gap. We cannot conserve what we do not know. Prof Ng, a well-known crab expert, led the 14-day South Java Deep Sea Biodiversity Expedition (SJADES 2018) with Professor Dwi Listyo Rahayu, a world authority on hermit crabs from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). The research vessel with 31 scientists and support staff sailed from Jakarta towards Cilacap in southern Java and back, covering a total distance of 2,200km. Using trawls, dredges, box corers and multicorers, the NUS-LIPI team collected marine animal samples at depths averaging 800m - the deepest was at 2,100m.  The result exceeded Prof Ng's expectations: Over a dozen new species of hermit crabs, prawns, lobsters and crabs were found, and more than 40 species of various kinds are new records for Indonesia. Here are some of them, in photos. DECORATOR CRABS (New to science) Three new species of bizarre-looking spider crabs were found – all in the deep waters of southwestern Java.  They were immediately recognised as unique species by Prof Ng and Dr Bertrand Richer de Forges from France, both of whom have been studying this group of crustaceans for over three decades. This yet-to-be-named crab was found camouflaged with detritus, small zoanthid anemones and mud. It has a distinctive plate that resembles oversized ears adjacent to its red eyes. A orange species with many strong spines. Only one specimen of this rare species was obtained. A decorator crab with a more elongated form. Several specimens were found clinging to stalked sea lilies, a living fossil. Scientists are still not sure if this is their only habitat, but they do believe these crabs have a preference for these sea lilies. Why do these crabs decorate themselves when there is no light in the depths of the ocean? That is because “a whole bunch of animals are using sound”, said Prof Ng. “They hit you with sonar. Which means that even if they can’t see you, you don’t want to look like a crab, you want to look like a blob of sponges.  Even in the deep, it pays that you try to pretend to be something you’re not. HERMIT CRABS (New to science or new for Indonesia) Hermit crabs live solitary lives protected by shells. They are a major component of the deep-sea fauna and appear in almost every catch. These animals come in a surprising diversity of form, shape and sizes. During the expedition, Prof Dwi found over 40 hermit crab species, many of which look nothing like the typical hermit crabs found in shallow waters and on land.  Some are very skinny because they live in hollow twigs. Some resemble small lobsters – they burrow into wood. Others live inside swollen sea anemones. Hermit crabs are mostly found in the shallow waters. There are few species in deeper waters, so the discovery of this new species is noteworthy.  The bright green eyes and distinctly patterned granulated pincers are distinctive for this new species. Professor Dwi immediately recognised it as something she has never seen before. This slender twig-dwelling hermit crab with a straight body has adapted its body to live inside the narrow cavities of hollow twigs and sticks.  GIANT SEA COCKROACHES (New to science) The expedition found a new species of Bathynomus, which is 30cm in length.  Also called giant sea cockroaches, they are important deep-sea scavengers. They feed on dead animals that sink to the ocean bottom, and are an integral part of the ecosystem there. However, Bathynomus had not been officially recorded in Indonesia before. There are 18 species globally, 15 of which reside in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Among these, the most famous are eight species which experts have called “supergiants” because they reach sizes of 50cm in length. WATCH: Meet the critters (3:24)  The two chief scientists were excited, and their check of the literature indicated that the “supergiant” species collected was quite different from known species - they may well be new. SHRIMPS & LOBSTERS (New to science) Also on the expedition was Professor Chan Tin-Yam from the National Taiwan Ocean University, a world expert in deep-water shrimps and lobsters who, with his team, discovered five new species. A new shrimp species with shiny eyes. These bottom-dwelling shrimps possess unique mechanisms to lock their abdomens to protect against predators. This was among the 20 species of squat lobsters found by scientists on the expedition. This species has a distinctive zebra pattern on its body. GOBY FISH (New to science?) Gobies are mostly found in shallow intertidal waters, but some can be found in much deeper waters of almost 200m, like the specimen in the photograph, which was collected from the Sunda Strait. This strange goby is flat-headed, and has very enlarged otoliths (ear stones for balance) behind the eyes. There are currently three known species in the world, and scientists are examining whether this specimen is one of them - or new to science. OTHER INTERESTING FINDS This 6cm deep-sea tube-dwelling worm pastes sediment grains with their tentacles to the pre-existing conical tube as they grow, forming a structure which resembles an ice-cream cone. This deep sea scallop has some peculiar habits. Scientists believe it is carnivorous, feeding on very small animals. In addition, it almost has a sea anemone attached to one of its valves – presumably for protection. Nicknamed the Dumbo Octopus because of its resemblance to the beloved Disney character, this animal has a jelly-like feel and was dark purple when first observed in the trawl net.  It swims using the two large flaps on its head. This peculiar squid measuring some 8cm has one eye much larger than the other.  It apparently swims with the larger eye looking downwards for food, whilst the smaller eye peers upwards presumably watching out for predators. A brightly coloured shrimp that was caught alive. It regurgitates a bioluminescent cloud to confuse predators when disturbed - a habit shared with several other species of deep-sea prawns. Nicknamed the chain-saw lobster, this is a rare deep-sea blind lobster with scary right claws lined with many sharp teeth.  Scientists, however, suspect that the claw is not a predatory device but acts to sieve bottom substrates for small animals to eat.  These lobsters are rarely collected because they dig deep burrows. The deep-sea tripod fish has peculiar fins and filaments that help it balance and detect small prey swimming past. It has eyes that have no lenses, so it’s unable to focus on objects.  Last but not least, they are hermaphrodites. These odd features help it survive in perpetual darkness. The aptly named Fang Tooth has wicked-looking long teeth. No escape for any prey that gets into this mouth.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/deep-sea-sunda-strait-new-species-singapore-indonesia-10227902"}, {"datetime": "12 May 2018 11:30PM", "tags": ["Halimah Yacob", "Brunei"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore, Brunei ink deals to boost cooperation in FinTech, counter money laundering", "content": " SINGAPORE: Two agreements were signed between Singapore and Brunei on Saturday (May 12), to boost cooperation in Financial Technology (FinTech) as well as to strengthen the exchange of information to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The signing of the agreements was witnessed by Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Singapore President Halimah Yacob, who is on a four-day state visit to Brunei. Both sides also welcomed the conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding on Info-Communications Media Cooperation between Singapore and Brunei's ministries of communications, to share expertise on developing the info-communications media industries of both countries, said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a press statement.  \"These agreements reflect the growing cooperation between Singapore and Brunei,\" it added.

The 11-storey Kampung Admiralty, located next to Admiralty MRT station, houses about 100 flats for seniors, along with healthcare, wellness and commercial facilities like a supermarket and hawker centre, all under one roof.  The pilot project, which was conceptualised by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) more than four years ago, aims to encourage active living among seniors, as well as inter-generational bonding. There is also a childcare centre within the development. Mr Lee said HDB had come up with the idea against the backdrop of an ageing population.  \"We wanted people to lead active and meaningful lives. And HDB looked for new ideas to develop new designs that would fit an elderly population - to build flats, common areas, and neighbourhoods to promote strong social support and community bonding, and to let people in their silver years stay socially engaged, and live safely, healthily and happily,\" he said. FACILITATING ACTIVE AGEING Under the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, the project is the first to co-locate eldercare and childcare facilities, with a childcare centre, as well as a community park and playground, located beside an Active Ageing Hub run by NTUC Health. The one-stop hub integrates active ageing and care services for elderly residents, such as day care and assisted living services. Programmes encouraging inter-generational bonding are also organised weekly, such as outdoor activities and music and art sessions.  \"These joint activities and regular interactions encourage the young and old to bond together,\" said Mr Lee. \"It's a wonderful way for the young people to learn empathy and respect, and also to lift the spirits of the elderly, when they see the children’s joy and vitality, they too will smile and perk up - and perhaps laugh and sing and dance as well.\" The development also houses the two-level Admiralty Medical Centre, as well as a hawker centre run by NTUC Foodfare and NTUC FairPrice. A skyrise community farm located on the rooftop allows residents to plant and harvest the edibles, with more than 30 tropical plants being grown. Its sheltered 1,000 sq m community plaza has held more than 50 group activities over the last year, including weekly fitness exercises, movie screenings and carnivals. REVIVING THE 'KAMPUNG' SPIRIT But it’s not just about the hardware. Residents Channel NewsAsia spoke to said they appreciate the \"kampung\" spirit fostered in the close-knit community. One of them is 70-year-old Ho So Wah, who is moving in with his 68-year-old wife next month, with the couple already active participants in the neighbourhood. \"The best part is we know more people, especially of our own age, so we can help each other, so anything we can ask,\" said Mr Ho. \"Although our children will come every week, but it’s better to have more people around here and we can spend the time inside the hub too.\" \"Before I move here … nothing. Just go home, work, go home, work. Even neighbour also close the door,\" said 58-year-old Doris Yuen. \"But here no, everybody very friendly.\" \"This is kampung, like sister, brother, all together so we help each other. This is what we want,\" said the resident, who moved in with her husband last year. \"At our age I don’t care if big house or small house, as long as there’s home for us that’s good. So I like this place very much. I hope Singapore can have more this kind of things for senior citizens so they don’t feel lonely.\" Spearheaded by seven agencies, the project has been recognised for its innovative design and approach. Partners of this initiative received the inaugural May Day Innovative Breakthrough Award, in recognition of the inter-agency efforts facilitating ageing-in-place. Said Mr Lee: \"This is a small kampung - modest in scale but bold in ambition. We will make it succeed, and when it is successful, we will build more kampungs like this in future HDB estates.\"", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/elderly-friendly-vertical-kampung-with-housing-healthcare-10227962"}, {"datetime": "12 May 2018 02:44PM", "tags": ["Mahathir Mohamad", "Malaysia general election", "Malaysia", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "author": "", "title": "PM Lee writes to Mahathir, congratulates Pakatan Harapan on 'winning tough fight'", "content": " SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has written to new Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, congratulating him on his victory.

Even as Grab explains that perks such as shopping gift cards and frequent flyer miles through GrabRewards have replaced the good old promotional codes, many are starting to realise that analysts’ warnings in the last few months were warranted. Several had said that discerning consumers should have figured out that the perks would not last forever as they did not make for a sustainable business model. The discounts are merely a strategy many industry disruptors use to acquire a larger market share. While some consumers only began to worry about monopolistic prices after Uber announced its intention to exit the Singapore market, Nitin Pangarkar, Associate Professor in the Department of Strategy and Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School pointed out that with or without the Uber-Grab merger, “the discounting was bound to stop at some point in time, probably as early as next year, because of Uber’s planned IPO.” If you think about it, fares are not really rising. They are now just being set at levels they should have been in the first place. Putting aside the issue of discounting, he said “we should not be unduly alarmed about the loss of consumer welfare because of high prices for the simple reason that there is a cap on how much the “new Grab” can raise prices, especially in Singapore.” READ: Nitin Pangarkar's commentary on Grab-Uber's merger. READ: A commentary on what can be done to ensure Grab's service standards remain high.  Also, as many others have pointed out, there are several alternatives to private-hire cars in our transportation ecosystem. Consumers could very well switch to taxis, trains and buses in the face of monopolistic prices. ANOTHER CYCLE OF DISCOUNTS However, since then several new players have entered the private-hire car service market. Ryde and Jugnoo have made their debuts. More are due to enter soon including local startup Filo and possibly, Indonesia’s Go-Jek. It is highly likely that we will see another round of promotional fares and other measures from these players aimed at expanding market share. But again, analysts warn we should not become accustomed to this state of affairs. Perhaps the best way to process this is to enjoy it while it lasts and not be unduly disappointed or alarmed when the situation normalises. Others say for as long as ride-hailing service providers are keen on entering the market even as some leave, we can be assured of cycle-after-cycle of perks for both riders and drivers as the market remains in flux at least in the short-term. We should note that several players who entered the market in 2013 and 2014, exited by 2016. Clearly this has not dampened other players’ desire to enter the market. In a recent episode of Channel NewsAsia’s podcast, The Pulse, executive adviser to the National Taxi Association and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) said we can expect this to carry on and it is not possible at this point to fathom if the market will ever stabilise.  He also pointed out that newcomers to the scene may end up offering a suite of services including concierge services which would include things such as queueing up to buy you bak kwa during Chinese New Year and delivering it to your home. THE LARGER TRANSPORT ECOSYSTEM But while private-hire cars services have been lauded in many quarters as a welcome panacea to the numerous difficulties consumers experienced with taxi services in the past, it is worth considering how such services fit into the larger transportation ecosystem. First of all, there are some indications that the state of flux is off-putting to drivers. ComfortDelGro Taxi announced on Monday (May 7) that it is set to add 200 new hybrid Hyundai Ioniqs to its fleet, bringing it close to 13,000. ComfortDelGro Taxi CEO, Mr Ang Wei Neng, said: “We have seen things settle down lately with more drivers switching from private-hire cars as they find driving taxis relatively more stable.” However, those who see driving for such services as a part-time job or a way to at least partially finance their own cars might see things differently. LOW FARES THWART SINGAPORE’S CAR-LITE VISION  At the same time, we should consider whether car-sharing services such as private-hire cars are furthering or thwarting Singapore’s car-lite vision. Observers point out that the roads seem more congested with the proliferation of private-hire cars. Several studies in the US have shown that while policymakers think that private-hire car trips have the effect of reducing trips by private passenger cars, it may very well be that low promotional fares are merely inducing demand from commuters who would otherwise have taken the train or bus. It’s quite common also for those who might have walked or taken a feeder bus service on the last-mile of their journey to now use a private-hire car service instead. Studies in the US of such services have shown similar findings. One by researchers at Northeastern University in Boston found greater congestion, and commuters who are now opting for a cheap private-hire car ride instead of walking, cycling or using public transport. Researchers at the University of California, Davis found an increase in the number of miles driven in and around cities including New York, Washington, Boston and Seattle. MORE REGULATIONS IN ORDER? If we are to forge ahead towards a car-lite Singapore, perhaps more regulations are in order. In his addenda to the President's address this week, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the authorities are “reviewing the regulatory framework to license the private-hire car (PHC) industry. We aim to keep the PHC and taxi industries open and contestable, and protect the interests of commuters and drivers”. Analysts have pointed out that private-hire car companies enjoy a lower-cost regime largely because of their business models and there is no cap to their fleet size. How exactly such services can be regulated to keep the market contestable and to also advance our move towards a car-lite Singapore remains to be seen. Experts need to look into how such services can target the demand for privately-owned cars more directly. ALTERNATIVES NEED TO BE ATTRACTIVE In the meantime, let’s remember that the Land Transport Authority’s target is to to expand the rail network to about 360km by 2030. With this, eight in 10 households will live within 10 minutes of a train station. As long as the train and bus services are accessible, reliable and efficient, “car-lite” can indeed be achieved. But if private-hire services continue to remain artificially cheap, commuters might opt for them instead. The authorities might very well have to reconsider how new services fit into the ecosystem not just for commuters’ convenience but whether they further Singapore’s larger goals.

Channel NewsAsia tabulated the numbers from Jan 2006 to Mar 2018, and found that Parliament sat for an average of 28.45 days each year between 2006 to 2017. While there was no discernible increase in the number of days Parliament has sat, the total length of time in terms of hours has gone up. Election years such as 2006, 2011 and 2015 saw shorter hours due to the dissolution of Parliament, which precedes each General Election. Parliament also sometimes takes a mid-term break lasting about a month, known as a prorogue, before beginning its second session. The latest prorogue ended on Monday (May 7) with the opening of the second session of the 13th Parliament.​​​​​​​ According to the data, the longest sitting happened on Feb 6 this year, where Parliament sat for 10 hours and 31 minutes. The marathon sitting was due to a lengthy debate on the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which allows for detention without trial. During the debate, the Workers’ Party spoke out against extending the legislation, which also saw two Nominated MPs vote “no”.  The shortest sitting was on May 18, 2009, which lasted 25 minutes. The session marked the opening of the second session of the Eleventh Parliament, during which then-President S R Nathan outlined the Government’s priorities, policies and programmes for the rest of the term. President Halimah Yacob also did so on May 7 - and she spoke for a  similar length of time. \n\n\n\n\n Sittings have also tended to be longer this year. Over the 12-odd years of data examined, there were 10 days that saw sittings that lasted nine hours or longer. Six of those 10 days happened this year.  Sittings are also typically longer during the yearly Budget and Committee of Supply debates, which is the extended period of parliamentary debate that follows the Budget speech early in the year. During this period, Parliament will sit for about ten days to debate the speech, and for each ministry to later present its expenditure plans for the new financial year.  According to the data, seven of the ten longest days in Parliament have occurred during the Committee of Supply debates. And five of them occurred this year: A round-up speech delivered by Leader of the House Grace Fu in Parliament highlighted that MPs had filed a total of 530 cuts, which lasted 3,120 minutes or about 52 hours, during this year's Committee of Supply debates.  \n\n\n\n\n There were also drawn-out debates during sittings outside of the Committee of Supply debate. For instance, a bill on what constitutes contempt of court was passed in Parliament on Aug 15, 2016. It was passed only after a lengthy debate between Law Minister K Shanmugam and MPs from the Workers' Party.  HOW DO THEY COPE? But having Parliament sit for longer may not be a bad thing. For one, as Mr Zaqy explained, the longer sittings could be a result of more robust debate in the House.  “You have more MPs speaking up and more people putting questions through, which ultimately means having a lot more people making speeches,” he said. “So I guess that’s why we’re seeing much longer sittings now.” “The other interesting thing is that there are also a lot more adjournment motions now,” he added. “This adds on to the sitting times as well.” “Parliament has had to grapple with a range of complex issues and bills relating to public order, corporate governance and cyber security, as well as phenomena such as fake news,” added Nominated MP Mahdev Mohan, who is an Assistant Professor of Law at the Singapore Management University. “It’s important that these matters which impact all Singaporeans are debated vigorously.” How then, do MPs cope, particularly those who hold full-time jobs? Mr Zaqy, who was a partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young at the time of his interview with Channel NewsAsia, admits that it can be difficult. He has since left the firm to take on a political appointment as Minister of State for National Development and Manpower. “There’s no dispensation on my targets and KPIs, so despite having fewer hours than usual to work, you still have to perform to your role,” he explained. “You just have to be efficient and ensure that your targets are met.” “In my previous firm, I used to take leave for Parliament sittings, and it could go all the way to a negative balance,” he added. “It becomes no-pay leave after that.” “Now, I still take annual leave when there are important meetings I have to miss, or if I have to go overseas on Parliament business. But otherwise, they just benchmark me on my targets.” MP for Nee Soon GRC Lee Bee Wah considers herself fortunate that unlike some of her fellow MPs, she does not have to take annual leave to be present for Parliament sittings. “Before I merged my company, I got the understanding from the chairman that I don’t need to apply for leave for MP work,” she said. Dr Lee, who is a professional engineer, used to run her own engineering firm that she eventually merged with a bigger firm, Meinhardt. She now holds the position of Group Director at Meinhardt Singapore. “This was one of the conditions before I let my company go,” she said. But she did have to take a pay cut in the process. “I’m receiving about a third of what I should be getting, because I told them I could only afford to spend a third of my time for the company,” she explained. “It’s a sacrifice I had to make.” Unlike MPs, Nominated MPs (NMPs) do not have to attend daily or weekly to their constituents’ concerns. But they face similar issues. Apart from being an NMP, Ms K Thanaletchimi is a senior assistant manager in the healthcare industry, a member of the NTUC Central Committee and the President of the Healthcare Services Employees' Union. She is also a member of several tripartite committees. Despite not having a constituency to take care of, unlike her MP colleagues, Ms Thanaletchimi said she spends a lot of time conducting extensive dialogue sessions with union members in the healthcare sector. She added that getting material resources to draft her speeches “do take some time”. As a result, she said, she works regularly from home on weekends and does late nights on weekdays to make up for the lost time. But still, there have been clashes.  She recalled an incident which she described as a time when she was “emotionally bankrupt”: When her mother was hospitalised for an urgent heart operation. “That was the very fateful day when I had a Parliament sitting, and had to rush down to speak on the Bill which I had already prepared for,” she said. ‘LIKE HAVING TWO FULL-TIME JOBS’ Sleep and social gatherings are other things the MPs have to forego – not just to attend and prepare for Parliament sittings, but to see to their day-to-day work as an MP. “Most times, I just work through the night,” said Mr Zaqy, who says he averages about 4-5 hours of sleep a night during peak periods. “Say you have a Meet-the-People session on Monday night and there’s a Parliament sitting on Tuesday. So you end up going home late on Monday, and it’s 3-4am before you can submit your speeches for the next day.” “I also honestly can’t remember the last time I had a social gathering,” he added. “I’ve lost contact with a lot of my friends, unless they’re in the same industry.”  “It’s really like having two full-time jobs.”  The same point was made by Dr Lee, who noted that she spends about 50 hours a week on MP-related duties.  “The moment I decided to enter politics, I was very clear in my mind that my first priority is to serve my residents,” she said. “Unfortunately this meant that I have to sacrifice my family time.”  While she makes it a point to be around on special days like her children’s birthdays or wedding anniversary, she added that she is at Nee Soon almost every other day. “They’ve been very supportive, and I think they understand,” she said.  So why, then, do they do it?  Asst Prof Mohan pointed out that being a non-partisan voice in Parliament for sectors and Singaporeans he believes deserve to be heard is a “privilege”. This is a sentiment, he said, that is also shared by the rest of his NMP colleagues. “When those voices contribute to law and policy through impassioned debate, or a constructive behind-the-scenes dialogue session with policy makers, our efforts are vindicated,” he said. For Dr Lee, the reason is simple.  “I benefitted from our system, and I feel that this a very good opportunity for me to give back and make a difference in people's lives,” she said.  “Other people have helped me, so now it's time that I help other people.”", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mps-parliament-sittings-full-time-jobs-10120268"}, {"datetime": "12 May 2018 06:34AM", "tags": ["Silver Generation", "Seniors", "Healthcare", "HDB"], "author": "Tan Jin Meng", "title": "Commentary: A bold vision of happy housing options for Singapore’s seniors ", "content": " SINGAPORE: In her speech to the Parliament on Monday (May 7), President Halimah Yacob stressed Singapore’s foundational values of self-reliance and inclusiveness.  She also spoke about helping older Singaporeans with social inequality, new housing options, and staying employable. She expressed a vision of Singapore as a “world-class city and an endearing home”. With the population of Singapore becoming so rapidly older, the aspiration of inclusiveness and developing an “endearing home”, should mean that seniors should be spending their time as mainstream members of society, not just at play, but also at work and in building happy, healthy communities. The retirees of tomorrow will not be the same as the retirees of today. They will be healthier, better educated, and have higher expectations of a post retirement lifestyle. With seniors expected to reach 25 per cent or more of our population in 2030, it is important to look at their quality of life. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said on Wednesday (May 9), that one of the broad strategies the Government will focus on is to develop and implement policies to enable all Singaporeans to age with purpose and dignity. OUR DEMOGRAPHICS Singaporeans have one of the world’s longest life expectancies. They also expect to live many years after age 65 in good to excellent health. The years lived in good health is a trend that has been increasing. 65 may be the new 50 as far as physical and mental capability is concerned. In 2030 and beyond, mainstream life in Singapore will be coloured in senior terms, as our population becomes one quarter aged. One only needs to look to Japan, who are one quarter senior now, and read news about how their society is faring. The current generation of retirees were around 40 to 49 in the early 1990s. In 1990, the 40 to 49 age group was six times more likely to have a below-secondary school education than this age group in 2017. They were also 10 times less likely to have a university education. The current generation of retirees have a vastly different education than our future generation of retirees. They will also have an income and a lifestyle expectation to match. They are also likely to be more capable in professional terms. The number of households with only seniors living in them has been increasing. This number has almost doubled since 2012 and is likely to increase dramatically again by 2030. Single people in the 40 to 49 year age group form almost 30 per cent of this age group. One can only do so much line dancing, tai chi, karaoke, travel, grandchild sitting and so on, before it begins to pall for some. Families are getting smaller too, with less having children, so the option to stay with family is getting less relevant. Singapore has one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, which has been below replacement rates since the 1970s. What these mean is that we can expect retirees in the coming decades to depend less on family, have higher expectations of lifestyle, and be capable of engaging in work, play and interaction with the community in significant ways. IMPORTANT TO THINK BOLDLY AND EXPERIMENT The Government has been heavily involved with promoting active ageing, ageing in place, and outreach to all seniors through programmes such as Silver Generation Ambassadors. This is very laudable and may even be unique in the world for its ambition. Retirement is frequently associated with a long slow road of decline. Much planning is spent on retirement adequacy, health and disability care. All these things are necessary, but insufficient. How dreary and wasted is a life spent just passing the time, without meaning, waiting to die? What is the desired quality of one’s senior life? What are the expectations and aspirations? 80 per cent of our population live in HDB estates - a great achievement by the Government. However, the overwhelming dominance of HDB and heavy reliance on government programmes may subtly lead us down well-travelled paths, and steer us from trying better solutions. Second Beginnings, a publication of the Lien Foundation, underlines this. We have been trapped in a ‘false choice’ between institutional long-term care and an idealised ageing-in-place vision. Healthcare institutions have traditionally been driven by a biomedical perspective on ageing that emphasises dependency, loss and decline. ONE IDEA: COOPERATIVE LIVING FOR SENIORS This idea is not for everyone. However, it might appeal to some. Supposing we form complete communities with seniors in a high-density living concept. Each senior can pay for 10 to 30 sq m of private space and an additional 15 sq m of common space. With 1,000 seniors, this can mean 15,000 sq m of common space. As a reference, the retail space of Raffles City is 39,000 sq m. The common space will be shared by all seniors and will include both businesses such as shops, supermarkets, clinics, childcare, kindergartens, yoga studios, disability care, as well as facilities such as common dining, recreation, exercise and other areas. These are facilities that will allow seniors to work, play and interact with the community. Seniors will get income from rental from these businesses but should also be encouraged to work at these venues with flexible work arrangements in place, and a small full-time professional staff to facilitate these arrangements. There should be no question of ageism or non-inclusiveness in these arrangements. With a large community of seniors, one can surely find almost any pre-retirement profession especially if units are sold to a wide socio-economic audience. HOW WILL THIS BE FUNDED? Currently, the Government has a programme to encourage seniors to downgrade to 2-room flexi flats with leases as short as from 15 years and prices from S$28,000 for a 36 sqm flat. From a financial point of view, rightsizing to this cooperative living community is going to be similar. To get the right price and avoid the risk of outliving the lease or having seniors choose a non-optimal lease, the price should include an insurance component so that seniors can be guaranteed accommodation as long as they or their partner live. The Government can assist by allocating and regulating land to be used only for this type of property arrangement, along with modifications to regulations relating to strata title living. I would recommend this be developed by the private sector to allow for innovation. Fears that such an option would be priced out of reach for people can be allayed by cash subsidies for those earning a lower income, and regulation to ensure a range of accommodation types in the same development. With economies of scale, fees paid by seniors need not be high. Seniors will also earn from the co-ownership of businesses and the ability to work flexibly. President Halimah said “We may be tempted not to go for bold changes, but instead be content to tweak things at the margins”.  So too must we apply this vision to housing for seniors – to ensure a high quality of life that allows them to be self-sufficient, giving them autonomy and control over their golden years.

And it did not take much, like stealing her seat or making fun of her, to make her burst into tears. “It was easy to just push that button,” said Ms Kua, now 21. “Once, I had some chee cheong fun sauce on my face, and it became a joke to the whole class. So I cried.” In primary school, she had self-esteem issues. To cope, she started to cut herself, at the age of 11. “I didn’t know there was such a thing as depression. I didn’t know self-harm was a thing … that it was in a way a problem, and shouldn’t be done,” she recounted. “To me, it was just cutting.” Studies suggest that depression – the most common mental illness in Singapore – may affect up to 18 per cent of youths here. And if not treated adequately, it has a propensity to persist into adulthood. In the documentary Facing Depression, three young Singaporeans opened up about how they found coping with adolescent life difficult, and their struggles with depression, anxiety and self-harming behaviour. THE PAIN ‘BECAME APPEALING’ According to the Samaritans of Singapore, the troubled youths who reach out to the organisation cite mental health issues, academic pressure and relationship problems at home and in school as their greatest sources of stress. This is because of the great amount of time a child spends in both environments, explained senior clinical psychologist Wong Hui Yi, from the Institute of Mental Health’s department of child and adolescent psychiatry. Ms Kua, for example, started feeling the academic pressure at her elite primary school, where expectations were high. She first engaged in self-harm after a poor mathematics test result. “My mum was like a math genius, so I felt as if I was terrible at this (maths) and wasn’t getting any better at it,” she said. “It kept spiralling downwards.” Thinking she was stupid, she cut herself as a form of self-discipline. She said: With every careless mistake I made, I’d inflict pain one time, so that I'd remember not to do it again. Eventually, it became something she did every time she was stressed. She had so many scars on her hands that she had to hide them from her teachers. Her self-esteem was so low that she disliked having her photo taken and did not even want to look at herself in the mirror when she brushed her teeth. At secondary school, she was ostracised because she was always feeling sad after her first relationship failed, when she was 13. And in a girls’ school, where “popularity is important”, being alone was a “very bad thing”. Regarding such friendship issues, Dr Wong said: “Among the pre-teens and the teens, the peer group becomes so important that they’re an excellent source of support, but at the same time they can be a source of much stress.” So it was for Ms Kua, who tried to cope with her depression through exercise and by confiding in a friend. But in her last year of secondary school, self-harm became her form of emotional release. “It's like how when we get caned, we feel the pain and we don't want to let this happen again,” she said. “Subsequently the pain just became appealing.” Children and adolescents who commit self-harm do so for various reasons, noted Dr Wong. For some, it is a way of coping with “very intense psychological pain”. She said: They feel some relief when they inflict physical pain on themselves. \"That’s a very unhealthy way of thinking, but to them it’s a way of control. They certainly need help.” HORMONAL CHANGES A typical teenager undergoes a difficult part of life trying to become an adult because it exposes teens to different kinds of life situations they had not experienced before, said The Resilienz Clinic’s medical director and consultant psychiatrist Thomas Lee. “Throwing tantrums or being moody may be one of the ways they cope. But the hormonal changes kind of add to the picture,” he added, explaining that these affect how the teens feel and behave. While the effects of oestrogen and testosterone on the brain are complex and not fully understood by scientists, what is known is that these two hormones can affect one’s moods. For teens who are already facing some life challenges, these fluctuations in hormones and brain chemicals could make them susceptible to depression, said Dr Lee. In teenager Jane's (not her real name) case, her behaviour started to change at the beginning of Secondary Three last year. She would wake up crying “uncontrollably”, said her mother. Getting her ready for school was a “hassle”, and when she reached, she would sometimes hide in the toilet, cry and call her mother to say that she was scared and did not want to be there. “It was heartbreaking. For the record, she called me eight times within two hours in the morning,” said Jane's mother, whose eyes reddened as she related the episode. At first, she wondered whether her daughter was calling for attention. “But there was never a lack of attention at home because we were so close,” she said, describing her 15-year-old as having been “quite emotional” since young. Jane herself realised something was wrong when she stopped talking and hanging out with her friends, and started losing her appetite and dreading school more and more. “I felt as if I was drowning,” she shared. Sometimes I got better, and it was as if … I found a log and could float with that. But after that, it was as if another wave came and hit me. It’s like a roller-coaster. While everyone has unhappy days and mood swings, a prolonged and intense mood swing, which may even last for months, could indicate depression, said Dr Lee. “If these changes start to affect the kid’s life, academically or his relationship with the peers or parents, then we have to start considering whether this kid is having depression,” he added. ‘MY BRAIN BROKE’ Mr Chia Xun An’s depression started when he was 10, triggered by an asthmatic episode and having sore eyes, which changed his appearance and affected his self-esteem. The situation at home did not help. Money was an issue, and for a few years, his family had to live in his maternal grandmother’s home. This resulted in frequent arguments among the adults, which took a toll on him. He had difficulty sleeping and would even hit his head against the wall at night. “They always say that depression is marked by low mood most of the time,” said Mr Chia, now 25. I tried my best to get rid of it, but unfortunately life had other plans. I really hit rock bottom – I thought I had lost hope forever. Diagnosed with major depressive disorder, he had to repeat a few years at school. But he worked hard to cope with his emotions, got into a polytechnic at the age of 19 and was discharged from his condition. “I just wanted to live life … to be like everybody else and break free from my past,” he said. “I was adjusting. I felt that I was finally reaching that sense of normalcy.” In his final semester in 2013, however, things took a turn for the worse. He started seeing scribbles and lines that were not there and hearing voices in his head that kept repeating, “Burn, burn, kill, kill, die.” He had never experienced these symptoms before. “It was terrifying,” recalled Mr Chia, who tried to fight off the depression, telling himself he did not want it to happen again. “But it got worse and worse,” he said. “I finally felt a shift in my mind … My brain broke. I finally lost control.” He dragged a chair to the front of the classroom, sat down and rambled for half an hour. He cannot remember what he said, but because of the relapse, he had to repeat his final year. “Sometimes when things like this happen, you just wish people would be more understanding,” he said. “But they didn’t really get it, they didn’t really see the severity of it or maybe they thought I was bluffing – I don’t know.” DEPRESSION ISN’T TRANSIENT Ms Kua’s turning point also came at polytechnic. With a new environment and new friends, she was feeling happier and her self-harming habit was seemingly a thing of the past – until one day when she started to experience bodily pains. To handle the pain, she grabbed a penknife off her table without thinking and cut her wrist so hard that it bled profusely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “The doctor said, ‘You were 0.1mm from the artery. A little bit more pressure, and you may not have been here today,’” recalled Ms Kua, who was 18 years old then. She could not understand why she lost control, since she thought she was happy, had things to strive for and reasons to live. Only then did she seek help for her depression. Dr Lee noted that many people, including parents, believe that depression or a change in mood “is just something that’s transient, or it’s some character defect”. But it’s not. Depression is very much a medical condition … which definitely needs treatment. As for Jane, she has her mother to thank for recognising that she had a problem, sitting her down and discussing why she was constantly feeling frustrated and crying. Together they ruled out cyberbullying, unhappiness at home and boyfriend issues. The girl said: “I knew there was something wrong – it could be depression or anxiety. But reading about the symptoms and actually feeling them yourself are very different things.” It was not long before she told her mother she wanted help. She was diagnosed with clinical depression and has been getting help since February last year. Looking back, Jane thinks her illness came about because all her friends went to another class after streaming at the end of Secondary Two and because of anxiety about her Higher Chinese course. She also thinks the stigma to seeking treatment means “people who are sick aren’t getting the help they need”. She admitted: “I was very ashamed of having to see a doctor.” A 2010 Singapore Mental Health Study found that the average time taken to seek help for major depressive disorder is four years, and Dr Lee agreed that stigma is “a very big obstacle” here. He added: (Another) very, very common reason is denial. Parents may think that the kid is just not feeling well … and hope that the kid will become better. “The other thing is that, even if they may really want to (get help), they may not know how to or where to get the help.” TREATING DEPRESSION There are generally two kinds of treatment: Antidepressants and psychotherapy. The latter involves a trained mental health professional exploring the issues that caused the depression in the first place. The health professional would guide the children towards what they should do when faced with certain kinds of adversities, shared Dr Lee. This includes teaching stress management skills, such as breathing exercises and muscle relaxation, as well as other coping strategies like sports and reading. Full recovery is possible, especially with support from the parents and other family members, said Dr Lee. But for some patients, certain setbacks, challenging situations or difficult relationships can trigger their depression again. “The whole purpose of therapy is to really teach these kids how to handle those situations or similar situations better in future,” he added. For Jane, slime-making and having a pet have helped her cope with her depression. “I had wanted a dog for the longest time ever. And she’s a blessing,” she said. “When I’m sad, she lies beside me and falls asleep. And it makes me a little bit happier. She doesn’t talk, but she gives me a lot of love.” Ms Kua, on the other hand, has turned to dancing, especially hip-hop. If she has a bad day, she would be dancing with “a lot of hard energy”. But if she is feeling sad, she would “do movements that I could relate that emotion to, and it would leave my body”. “Dance is like the friend I never had – my perfect friend. It doesn’t judge; it never leaves you unless you choose not to do it,” she said. She is now working at the IMH as a peer support specialist, helping others with their recovery journey. Meanwhile, Mr Chia is actively raising awareness about mental illness. He has been volunteering with Over The Rainbow, a charity promoting youth mental wellness, and has self-published a book about his experience with depression. An undergraduate today, he is working on a second such book. His parents, who did not understand his depression for a long time, have finally accepted him for who he is. And in doing outreach work in the community, he wants to spread the message that it is a medical condition that can be treated and managed with a support system. “I’ve been particularly vocal about stigma and discrimination. And by doing that, I hope that things will change,” he said. “I hope that in future, individuals with mental health challenges can face it without fear and without being alone.” *Editor's note: An earlier version of this story identified Jane.

Net profit for the quarter ended March fell 19.6 per cent to S$66.3 million, due in part also to the non-recurrence of special dividends from its subsidiary Cabcharge Australia, the company said in a statement on Friday (May 11) after market close. Group revenue was S$878.8 million, or 1 per cent higher than the same period last year. ComfortDelGro has faced intense competition from third-party apps such as Uber and Grab, for both passengers and cab drivers. The private-hire industry, however, has undergone changes recently, after Grab announced in March that it would acquire Uber's Southeast Asia operations. While the deal is pending regulatory approval in Singapore, Uber has already shut down its app and exited the market.  \"Revenue from the taxi business is expected to stabilise with the rationalisation of the competition landscape in Singapore,\" ComfortDelGro said in its financial statement. ComfortDelGro Group CEO, Mr Yang Ban Seng, added in a press release that he believes there will be a more level playing field ahead. \"With the reduced subsidy and incentives for drivers and riders by ride-hailing apps operators, and the Authority’s review of regulations for private hire vehicles, we believe that the competition will be on a more level playing field going forward. This is a positive development,” he said. At a group level, the company saw revenue decrease across most divisions, including its automotive engineering services, inspection and testing services, car rental and leasing, and bus station businesses. The public transport services business posted an increase in revenue, while the driving centre business remained the same. The company has stepped up the pace of mergers and acquisitions in recent months, with a total spend of S$123 million so far in 2018 - compared with S$166 million in the preceding five years. In April, the company announced that it would acquire Australian bus company Tullamarine Bus Lines for A$32.2 million (S$32.7 million), as well as another S$30.2 million to expand into Australia's patient transportation business. That same month, it also announced the acquisition of the private bus chartering assets of Singapore's AZ Bus for S$10.25 million. “The first quarter of 2018 has been very eventful for us. We have inked several acquisitions as we step up our pace of mergers and acquisitions,\" said Mr Yang. \"The group will continue to actively seek acquisition opportunities to scale up our existing operations, and in adjacent businesses that will leverage on our strength,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/comfortdelgro-first-quarter-net-profit-falls-20-percent-10225774"}, {"datetime": "11 May 2018 08:11PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "North Korea", "United States", "politics"], "author": "", "title": "Trump, Kim summit in Singapore presents logistical challenges for North Korea", "content": " SINGAPORE: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's trip to Singapore for talks with US President Donald Trump poses logistical challenges that are likely to include using Soviet-era aircraft to carry him and his limousine, as well as dozens of security and other support staff.    The choice of Singapore as the site of the first-ever meeting of a sitting US president and a North Korean leader was as much because it was within reasonable flight time and distance from Pyongyang as because of the island state’s political neutrality, a South Korean presidential official told reporters. Since becoming North Korea’s leader in 2011, Kim has only taken one known overseas trip by air – and that was earlier this week to Dalian in China to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He flew in his personal Ilyushin-62M jet accompanied by a cargo plane that people with knowledge of North Korean affairs say is believed to have carried his limousine. \"It looks very much like the trip to Dalian was a dry run,\" said Andray Abrahamian, a research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS and formerly with Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group that trains North Koreans in business skills. At 4,700 km from Pyongyang's Sunan airport, Singapore is easily in the range of the Il-62M aircraft. The Soviet-era narrow-body jet with four engines was first introduced in the 1970s and has a maximum range of 10,000 km. But the Ilyushin-76 cargo plane cannot fly more than 3,000 km without refuelling if carrying a full load. It will therefore have to stop off at a friendly location like Vietnam’s capital on the way to Singapore or fly with a reduced load. The Il-76, originally designed for moving heavy machinery to remote parts of the Soviet Union, is big enough to fit a school bus or two shipping containers inside it, according to passenger and cargo flight operator Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions. But the cargo plane has had some safety issues. In the latest incident last month, a crash killed 257 people on board after takeoff from an Algiers air base. Unlike his father Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011 and who travelled by armoured train on his rare trips abroad because he feared being shot down, according to a North Korean defector familiar with his security details, the younger leader is not known to be averse to flying. But air travel of this distance does pose a significantly greater challenge in transporting communication and security equipment and personnel needed to back up a summit meeting. SUITE FIT FOR A LEADER Lee Yun-keok, a defector who had worked for the North's government and now heads the North Korea Strategic Information Service Center in Seoul, said the trip will involve dozens of security personnel and equipment including possibly a personal toilet for the leader. It will also mean burning a large quantity of jet fuel, a refined oil product sharply limited by UN sanctions targeting North Korea’ imports. Kim's two planes will need around 50 metric tons of jet fuel per aircraft for the flight from Pyongyang to Singapore. China, the main source of fuel for the North, exported just 3 tons of jet fuel in March and made no official exports the two previous months, according to Chinese customs data. But the North's planes can pick up extra fuel when they fly to China and Russia for commercial operations, and international security experts believe the North may have been stockpiling the fuel which it has also used for its missile programme. “The United States had preferred Geneva,\" the South Korean presidential official told reporters, requesting anonymity to discuss the arrangements for the summit meeting. \"But Singapore was selected as it was the most realistically viable destination Kim Jong Un could probably travel when considering the travel time and flight distance.\" The two sides initially considered meeting in the Panmunjom truce village straddling the Korean military border, the scene of the third inter-Korea summit attended by Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month, the official said. The official said the South did not know the reason why Panmunjom was dropped. There was no confirmation on the specific location for the meeting between Kim and Trump although there are a number of sites in Singapore that can guarantee security protection, including hotels that have experience hosting high-security events, Singapore media and a Singapore government official said. The meeting is scheduled for one day on Jun 12, but if either or both of the leaders decide to stay overnight, there is only one hotel room in all of the city that meets “security protocol\" for the US president, according to a source with knowledge of previous US presidential visits. That is the 348 sq m Shangri-la Suite in the Valley Wing of the hotel of the same name, at a current rate of S$10,000 (US$7,500) a night for Jun 12.

Amid President Trump’s announcement that his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place in Singapore on Jun 12, and Mike Pompeo’s taking over as Secretary of State, now is the time to address one of the most important unfilled US ambassadorships. More broadly, as a defence partner, free trade partner and export market that supports 215,000 American jobs, and with which the United States enjoys a US$20 billion trade surplus in goods and services annually, Singapore certainly deserves the courtesy of a US ambassador. Filling the top post will also strengthen the US’ ability to continue expanding bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interests. SECURING BILATERAL DEFENCE RELATIONS The role of Singapore vis-à-vis US national security strategy in the Indo-Pacific cannot be overstated, which makes the absence of an ambassador all the more concerning. Both sides clearly place importance on defence cooperation. In April 2017, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen was among the first foreign defence ministers to visit Defence Secretary James Mattis during the early days of the Trump Administration. The enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (eDCA) signed in December 2015 strengthened cooperation in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, cyberdefence and biosecurity, and built on earlier bilateral agreements including the forward deployment of US naval vessels, the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding and the 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement. Indeed, the US and Singapore maintain an excellent and long-standing bilateral defence relationship, and with the confirmation last December of Randall Schriver as the Pentagon’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific affairs, such ties are likely to expand. SENSITISING THE US TO SINGAPORE AND ASEAN’S INTERESTS Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had excellent relations with recent US Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama. Mr Lee also met President Trump in Washington DC in October 2017, during which time the two leaders issued a statement reaffirming the strong and enduring partnership especially in the economic, defence, security, and people-to-people spheres, and also witnessed the signing of an agreement by Singapore Airlines to purchase 39 Boeing aircraft for US$13.8 billion that will create more than 70,000 US jobs. Despite the good personal ties at the leadership level, issues of disagreement are bound to surface even between countries that share common interests and shared perspectives on regional issues. In December 2017, Singapore joined more than 100 United Nations members to vote in favour of a motion to reject the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite US warnings to its friends that the US \"will remember this day\". Where disagreements surface in multilateral initiatives, Singapore must be expected to move forward in a direction in line with its national interests, as with any other country. Singapore, with 10 other countries, inked the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership despite the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the original TPP. Periodic disagreements and discussions on regional issues require a US ambassador on post to serve as a facilitator and mediator between Washington and Singapore. Additionally, Singapore chairs ASEAN this year, which is an important platform for regional countries in Southeast Asia to engage extra-regional countries like the US on areas of shared interests. Perhaps most importantly for the maintenance of excellent bilateral ties is the need for the United States to familiarise itself with Singapore’s transition to the fourth generation leadership team.  With last month’s extensive cabinet reshuffle, now is the time for a US ambassador to expand relationships with leaders in Singapore who will lead the country into the future. EXPLAINING US POLICY TO SINGAPORE The Trump Administration’s National Security Strategy published by the White House last December pledges to strengthen the US' partnerships with Singapore, though China, with whom Singapore maintains excellent relations, is identified as a key global competitor to the US, along with Russia. The 2018 National Defence Strategy, published by the Pentagon in January, identifies as a main concern “China’s military modernisation, influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighbouring countries to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage”, and states that the strategy’s most far-reaching objective is to set the military relationship between the US and China on “a path of transparency and non-aggression”. A US ambassador will explain to stakeholders in Singapore, including policymakers, scholars, and the defence industry, how both strategy documents will shape US foreign policy in Asia. Amid White House concerns about China’s gaining access to important technologies and trade imbalances, the Trump administration recently refused to allow Broadcom to proceed in its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm, forcing Broadcom to abandon what would have been one of the biggest takeovers in technology industry history.  An ambassador would be an important spokesman to explain why this outcome occurred notwithstanding the close trade ties between both countries, and especially as Broadcom was essentially run from its San Jose, California office and recently completed the transition of its parent to a Delaware corporation. As to the possibility of a tariff war with China, now that China and the US do not appear to be much closer to a solution, the concerns of many US business executives who oversee Asia businesses from a regional headquarters in Singapore, as well as Singaporean companies who manufacture in China for export to the US, can best be addressed by an ambassador who can shed light on considerations behind the Trump Administration’s trade policies. WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN A US AMBASSADOR Recent US ambassadors to Singapore have been political appointees rather than career foreign service officers. Previous and relevant government service is also important. Prior to his ambassadorship in Singapore, Jon Huntsman was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for East Asia and the Pacific in the George HW Bush administration and a Staff Assistant to President Ronald Reagan.  Frank Lavin was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Asia and the Pacific in the George H W Bush administration and White House Director of the Office of Political Affairs under President Reagan. Most US ambassadors to Singapore identify an achievable goal that will serve as a sustainable legacy, such as Ambassador Lavin’s efforts to negotiate and sign the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement or Ambassador David Adelman’s initiation of the US-Singapore Strategic Partnership Dialogue. Past ambassadors also typically continue to contribute to Singapore. Lavin later served as Under-Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, where he promoted bilateral trade, and he currently is a director of Singapore’s UOB.  Adelman went on to serve as a member of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Capital Markets Committee. With Singapore’s membership in the CPTPP, and the Trump Administration’s decision to implement trade remedies to address trade imbalances between the US and its trading partners, the next US ambassador must have an intimate understanding of US–Singapore trade relations. Whether it comes to understanding Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act that is the basis for many of the significant trade remedies announced with regard to China, customs regulations, Singapore’s investment laws, intellectual property rights protection amid a rapidly changing digital economy, and World Trade Organisation processes, an expertise in global trade is crucial. DESERVING OF A US AMBASSADOR SOON Singapore is one of the Trump administration’s key partners in the Indo-Pacific and as such, deserves a US ambassador on post as soon as possible. As the Trump Administration plans the Trump-Kim summit, implements an Indo-Pacific strategy, and responds to China’s unfair trade practices, the need is increasingly urgent. Even as the US ambassador to Singapore can help set the tone for US diplomacy not only in Singapore, but for the broader region, the unfilled position in Singapore is also a reminder that there is also no nominee to serve as US ambassador to ASEAN, for whom the experiences discussed above are also relevant. Let’s hope the Trump Administration nominates an ambassador to Singapore, as well as one to ASEAN soon. The author is a political analyst who advises on US trade and security relations with Asia.

The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) will expand its range of education, advisory products, and programmes beyond Drug Guidances and Appropriate Care Guides, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in his ministry’s Addendum to the President’s Address on Friday (May 11). The ACE, established in 2015, gives healthcare guidance to improve patient outcomes and healthcare value. The expansion serves to support healthcare professionals, patients and the public in “making more informed and appropriate decisions”, Mr Gan said. “Beyond ensuring good quality care, we will strive towards helping Singaporeans make better choices.” This comes as President Halimah Yacob, in her Parliament address on Monday, said the Government will prioritise the forging of a cohesive, caring and inclusive society for the remainder of its term. To that end, Mr Gan said the Ministry of Health (MOH) is expanding healthcare capacity by building more hospitals, polyclinics and primary care networks comprising general practitioners. Beyond increasing capacity, Mr Gan said MOH will transform care models by experimenting with “innovative and potentially game-changing concepts” and bringing care beyond the hospital to the community. The community will also have a part to play in caring for the elderly, as MOH expands community-based care facilities and experiments with new forms of housing for more accessible care. “We will develop social nodes in the community to bring active ageing, preventive health, functional health screening, and other programmes to the doorsteps of seniors,” Mr Gan said. And to complement this, Mr Gan said MOH will continue to build up capabilities for nurse-led, community-based care. “We will create good job opportunities for Singaporeans in the growing healthcare sector, and enable our healthcare workforce to stay relevant through skills upgrading.” BETTER KINSHIP CARE ARRANGEMENTS Besides the elderly, another vulnerable group will also get more help. Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee said in his ministry’s addendum that it will continue to improve support for children who experience abuse and neglect. “This includes intervention to support families to make the home environment safer for children, and expanding foster care so that children who cannot be with their biological families can still grow up in a family environment,” he said. To that end, Mr Lee said the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will explore how to further enhance kinship care arrangements, where children are cared for by relatives. This ensures the children remain more closely connected with their families. “We plan to strengthen case management support and training for kin carers to better care for the children, and are working on the details,” an MSF spokesperson said. MSF will also strive to give children a good start in life by ensuring families can benefit from accessible, affordable and quality early childhood services, Mr Lee said. This includes expanding full day pre-school places to provide a place for every child who needs one. Children from low-income families will benefit from a “strong ecosystem” of support through the KidSTART pilot, Mr Lee added. “We will partner parents to enable their children to develop holistically in the familiar settings of their home and pre-school.” Moving on to families, Mr Lee said MSF will provide marriage preparation programmes and support parents in caring for and bonding with their children. The ministry will also work towards reducing the negative impact on children arising from a divorce. In the bigger picture, Mr Lee said MSF will create a caring and inclusive society by supporting Singaporeans of all abilities, strengthening the social service sector and nurturing a spirit of giving and caring. “Creating a more cohesive society is a continuous endeavour over the long-term,” he added. STRONG IDENTITY AND MUTUAL TRUST A cohesive nation is also enabled by “active citizenry”, Culture, Community and Youth Minister Grace Fu said in her ministry’s addendum. “Singaporeans must have a strong sense of shared identity, trust and engage each other, and exercise their civic responsibilities for the common good.” To create a strong national identity, Ms Fu said the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) will safeguard national heritage, build a vibrant and distinctive arts scene, and rally the nation through sporting achievement. Another ingredient for cohesion is mutual trust among people, Ms Fu said, adding that MCCY will grow common spaces to foster social mixing and inclusion and enable youth to engage one another and the Government. As for being a caring nation that looks out for each other, Ms Fu said MCCY will inspire a culture of volunteerism and giving, and promote a social movement towards healthy living. “A strong society is one that is caring, inclusive, and has a shared sense of past and future,” she added.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/addenda-to-president-s-address-more-help-for-patients-health-10225600"}, {"datetime": "11 May 2018 06:30PM", "tags": ["MUIS"], "author": "", "title": "Case of self-radicalised Singaporean a reminder such threats 'remain alive': MUIS", "content": " SINGAPORE: The recent detention of a self-radicalised Singaporean under the Internal Security Act (ISA) is a reminder that such threats \"remain alive\", said the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) in a media statement on Friday (May 11).

Said Dr Nazirudin: \"That is why we must continue to protect our community by building in them religious and spiritual resilience, through the correct and contextual appreciation of Islam and its teachings.  \"This is the role that our accredited asatizah play in guiding Muslims in their socio-religious life, so that each Muslim embraces the compassionate and peaceful spirit of Islam, and is well-equipped to immediately reject any form of extremist ideology.” Dr Nazirudin also called on families and friends to be vigilant and \"help connect their loved ones to avenues where questions about religion and Islam will be answered by credible and trained asatizah\". MUIS also highlighted drop-in sessions at the Masjid Al-Falah in Orchard Road, which aim to provide a \"safe space\" for people to consult an Asatizah Youth Network (AYN) asatizah. \"Religion has been exploited to justify violence and destruction with no regard to the sanctity of life,\" said Executive Imam and Head of Islamic Learning at Masjid Muhajirin, Ustaz Mohammad Khalid Rafi. \"Islam calls for the pursuit of peace and that should be our priority as Muslims. Let us not be misguided by disinformation promoted by such propaganda of hate.\" ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/self-radicalised-singaporean-detained-isa-muis-10225514"}, {"datetime": "11 May 2018 06:22PM", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Kim Jong Un", "North Korea"], "author": "", "title": "Singapore seems to be the perfect location for Trump-Kim summit, says US state department", "content": " WASHINGTON: Singapore was chosen to host the historic summit between United States president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un because it \"seems to be the perfect location\", a spokesperson from the US state department has said. \"We needed a city that has the infrastructure so that you can bring in so many journalists, government officials to pull together a meeting of this size, scope, and importance.

Muhammad Khalis Ramlee had initially been sentenced to an aggregate of 10 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane for his role in the events that resulted in the death of American John Denley Nelson, who had tried to intervene as a peacemaker. On Friday (May 11), Khalis’ aggregate sentence was reduced to seven and a half years’ jail and 20 strokes of the cane. Khalis had been convicted in the State Courts for two counts of rioting and one count of drug consumption. He was also convicted of one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, for which he had received a sentence of seven years’ jail and 12 strokes of the cane. According to court documents, Khalis and some of his friends had gathered at a bar on Circular Road for drinks on Christmas Eve 2015. Some members of the group, according to the documents, had secret society affiliations. At about 2.40am, two of Khalis’ friends, who were in a relationship, started quarrelling outside the bar. Most of the group followed the couple and tried to break up the fight, which had turned loud and violent and attracted the attention of others in the area. Unhappy that they were being watched, some members of the group, including Khalis, began attacking the onlookers, eventually resulting in two separate fights breaking out. Shortly after the fights, Mr Nelson, who was not involved in the brawls, stepped in to try and make peace between the attackers and one victim who was left behind. Khalis then lunged at Mr Nelson from behind and punched him so forcefully that Mr Nelson fell to the ground, with his head and shoulders hitting the kerb. Witnesses said Mr Nelson hit the ground with a loud crack. Nr Nelson was rushed to hospital where an emergency brain surgery was performed. However, he succumbed to severe head injuries and died on Jan 1, 2016. Khalis, who contended that the sentence he received for the grievous hurt charge was “manifestly excessive”, had his sentence for the charge reduced to four and a half years’ jail and eight strokes of the cane. DISTRICT JUDGE “UNDULY INFLUENCED” BY KHALIS’ INVOLVEMENT IN OTHER TWO FIGHTS In his written judgement, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon pointed out that the district judge rightly considered that Khalis’ attack was “unprovoked and sudden”, leaving Mr Nelson with little chance to defend himself. However, CJ Menon also noted that in determining the appropriate sentence for Khalis, the district judge had been “unduly influenced” by Khalis’ involvement in the riots, which had preceded his attack on Mr Nelson. CJ Menon explained that although the district judge had said he was mindful that the sentence imposed for the grievous hurt charge should not doubly punish Khalis for taking part in the riots, the district judge had nonetheless considered that “he could not ignore the fact that the (grievous hurt offence) had occurred in the context of a night of mindless group violence”. “While the context of (Khalis’) violence might conceivably have been relevant, his attack on (Mr Nelson) could not be said to be part of the two riots and thus a part of the mindless group violence that pervaded the night,” wrote CJ Menon. He added that the highest case that could be mounted against Khalis was that he had intended to “forcefully punch” Mr Nelson, in circumstances where he knew this was likely to cause a fracture or other forms of grievous hurt either directly or through causing him to fall. “This is at some distance from the death that ensued, and it seems to me that this is a further factor that calls for the sentence to be moderated,” he said. For causing grievous hurt, Khalis could have been jailed up to 10 years, with a fine or caning. ", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-christmas-eve-rampage-punch-killed-stuntman-sentence-reduced-10224168"}]
